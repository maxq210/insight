Agreed, what's your point?
If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
What, are you kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.
I'm sure she'll still love him.
Well, what do you want to do?
Okay.
I don't know, I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.
Bye.

No.
Not really.
I don't care. Two millimetres? That doesn't seem right.
Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
New neighbour?
Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Great.
Bye.
Should we have invited her for lunch?
We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.
Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.
Yes, and you've never met one of them.
Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.
Hi.
Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?
Wow.
So you're like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.
Holy smokes.
At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
In what universe?
Uh, do you guys mind if I start?
So, sit next to me.
What's the difference?
Here we go.
Do you want me to move?
Just sit somewhere else.
Sheldon, sit!
Well this is nice. We don't have a lot of company over.
Yes I now, but…
I'm sorry.
Um, me, okay, I'm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else, oh, I'm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.
Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.
It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.
Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that's like as long as High School.
Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?
Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
No.
No.
Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
How so?
That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode.
The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
Excuse me?
What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me, I'm a male and she's a female?
I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbour.
That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. However briefly.
It's just not a good time.

Must we?
She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.
Which is?
That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.
Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.
Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.
To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.
Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
Get lost.
We're not going to give up just like that.
Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.
This is it.  I'll do the talking.
I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
Oh. We're scientists.

What?
I'm sorry.
Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this.
And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.
Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I've got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.
Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.
Really? Great.
Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
Sure.
So?
So?
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
Uh, I'm not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
Are there any chopsticks?
No.
Yeah, I probably won't, but… Hey Sheldon.
Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?
A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
One. .
Yes, I know, men can't fly.
Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.
Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.
Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.
I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
Okay, her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken so you're going to have to  oh, you're just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
Why not?
We don't need strength, we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it's just a matter…  I don't have this… I don't have this I don't have this.
Do you have any ideas?
Easy, easy  Okay! Now we've got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.
Exactly half. Let's push. Okay, see, it's moving, this is easy, all in the math.
Almost there, almost there, almost there.

You okay?
So Penny's a little messy.
Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?
Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.
Come on, we should go.
What are you doing?
Sheldon, this is not your home.
When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.
What were you doing in his closet?
Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
No.
No.
Oh, great, thank you again .
Sheldon!
Are you insane, you can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.
Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here?
No, no. You gave me an explanation, it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.
What?
That's ridiculous.
Fine. I accept your premise, now please let's go.
O-o-o-oh! .

Morning.
I'm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour's apartment and clean.
You think?
You know what, you've convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.
Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.
How did she know it was us?
God, this is going to be bad.
Yes, but, only to clean.
In my apartment, while I was sleeping.
And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
Sure, that's another way to go.
You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  What's funny?
No.
What?
What's his problem?
Six two inch dowels.
One package, Phillips head screws.
No, please, we insist, it's the least we can do considering.
It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.
And control it how?
Hey guys, I got this.
Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?
Oh, I've got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.
Alright, just a few more feet, and…. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.
Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.
Sheldon, he's got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!
Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.
You betrayed us for money, who are you?

Excuse me.
No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! .
I'm a romantic.
Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
I don't know. Olivia Geiger?
Yeah.
Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?
Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side.
That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?
Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?
Hey, what's going on.
Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.

You don't know me, you don't wear my chains… God, that's a good song.
I know what you're thinking, I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.
I've been thinking about names, I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.
Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.
It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me, the woman rejected me.
You're right. I didn't ask her out, I should ask her out.
No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out.
How do I look?
Six thirty.
By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.
No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
You're right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there's a pause, we both know what's happening, I lean in, we kiss, it's a little tentative at first but then I realise, she's kissing me back, and she's biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we're going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!
I'm having a panic attack.
If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack, that's why they call it a panic attack.
Why?
Okay.
What?
Oh, who am I kidding, I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.
Yes.
I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.
Give me the phone.
I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.

Awesome!

Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Interesting.
Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover?
Then I guess congratulations are in order.
Yes, I was there.
What?
Well then we'll avoid Finkleday, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
Mahalo's a nice touch.
Of course, but it's all Indian food. You can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.
What.  Howard brought a date?
Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?

Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
Morning
You're making eggs for breakfast?
Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
You know, I'm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.
Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?
I'm sorry?
Four dozen?
Okay, one more time?
How come you didn't go into work today.
So you got canned, huh?
Well, maybe it's all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.
No, no, I meant…
Never mind.
We're fine.
Oh, sure I am.
120?
Well, yeah.
Let's say 4,390.

Thank you.
Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn't you say you needed some eggs.
Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.
Interesting.
No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
What now?
Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

Oh, I don't know Sheldon, it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.
What?
You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.
Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.
What's with the fish?
What happened to your scrambled egg research?
So… fish.
Fish nightlights.
Mum's the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don't want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.
Like luminous fish.
Right… I didn't….
I didn't know what else to do, he's lost all focus, every day he's got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one.
Hi baby.
Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.
Honey, why did you get a loom?
Leonard called me.
Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
Really, when was the last time you left the house.
That was three weeks ago.
Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.
Where are you going?
Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
Good morning, snicker-doodle.
Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?
But intelligently designed by a creator, right?
You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?
Well, I'm done fishing.  You put those on.
Because you're going to go down to your office, you're going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back.
I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness?”
Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody but you can't go around pointing it out.
Because people don't like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let's get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let's shove off.
Sheldon, he's just doodling, get in here.
Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.
Please. Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?
Hey, how did it go?
Really? What happened?
I'm very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today.
Mmm-hmm?

Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.
Well, it's all good.
Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.
Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?
The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Because you are not at Big Boy!
I didn't know you ate here.
Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?
Thank you Sheldon.
What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?
If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.
How so?
Oh, hey Sheldon, what's going on?
I'm sorry?
Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not.
Well what?
Oh, come on, you went to college.
Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy.
We really shouldn't be standing here.
Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?
Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?
So, do you know who's in there?
Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.
What's the matter?

Hey, what's the matter?
Are you sure?
Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
You're welcome.
Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?
Thank you, I'll see you at work.
What?
No-one.
There are no incorrect equations on my board.
I'm sorry, I've got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. .
You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she's still going to be right.
Sheldon!
Wuh, I don't…. th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not…. Sheldon, we have to go!
Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.
You know what, I'm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent.
She fixed your equation.
Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.
Yeah.

No kidding.
Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
Really?
So, how's everything.
Really, oh yay!
Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
Are you even listening to me?
I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.
Sheldon, let it go.
I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.
So, how was paintball, did you have fun?
Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing…
Yeah, I don't know, Penny…
We're really more….
Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.
Um, yeah, Halloween.
Sure.
Fine.
Of course.
Oh, no.
Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!
Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.
No, it's not…
Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.
For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.
Late? It's 7:05.
Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.
Probably, but in their own homes.
The parade?
Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.
Okay.
No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights.
We're socialising. Meeting new people.
She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.
I  want to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people.
How so?
Go on.
Then what happens?
This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.
No, you're coming with me.
Come on.
Yes. But I need a wing-man.
Hi.
So, what are you supposed to be?
Uh, a choo-choo train?
I still don't get it.
Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Because I'm Frodo.
Oh no.
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.
If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.
Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. .
Maybe they just want to be friends.
Then he and I are on equal ground.
Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.
Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.
No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.
Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?
So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?
I think we're all talking to Penny here.
No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.
So what, I'm unevolved?
Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.
Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.
Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.
What's that?
No.
Good night Sheldon.

Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?
He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God.
I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
Oh, that's very impressive. And a little racist.
So? We'll start now.
If we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time.
Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she's like “Hey, how's California,” and I'm like “Awesome” ‘cos, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.
Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.
Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you're new in town.
Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment.
Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back.
Great idea.
Why?
Oh, what, what, what?
Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?
It's the only way we can play teams.
Ha-ha, there goes your head again.
Yeah, so is Sheldon.
Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.
This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look, it's raining you!
She's an enigma, Raj.
She's gone, Sheldon.
Okay, I have a problem.
Uh, the couch is good.
Let me guess, you have a problem with this.
It's up to you, crazy person's choice.
Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?
So?
I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?
Hu.. what?
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.
How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
Thanks Leonard.
I'm listening.
Why?
I'll risk it.
Anything else I should know.
What are you doing?
Penny's still sleeping.
I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?
What the hell is your problem?
chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
Leonard.
Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.
I do not, my mother lives with me.
Sheldon you just can't dictate…
Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!

We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
I see a problem.
So, we'll just order three entrees.
We could cut it into thirds.
Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
That works.
If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.
Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.
We don't order egg rolls.
Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.
You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.
Yeah, we can always divide soup.
Oh, hey guys, what's up?
Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?
Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.
Well, for Penny it's dancing night.
No.
Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
So?
Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.
Who are you calling?
Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.
You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.
What are you guys doing here?
I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle.
I can't see him.
That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.
All I've got is a needler, and I'm all out of ammo.

Problem?
Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?
Why?
And over here is Sheldon.
If you don't want to meddle, then why are you meddling.
Why are you telling me about my own culture?
Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programmes in India.
I bet they love Scrubs.
Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?
What?
Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally.
So who wants to rent Fiddler?

I need some guinea pigs.
Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.
Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?
Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.
That's, um, rum and coke without the rum.
So coke.
There's a can in the fridge.
Then swim to Cuba.
Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women but… you've been talking to me.
I'd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail.
What happened?
Okay.
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.
What?
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.
Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.
Oh, no it isn't.
We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?
Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great, she isn't fat any more!
I'm sorry?
Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?
Oh. Us Indian, or “come to our casino” Indian?
Oh.
Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.
Don't be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.
Back off Sheldon.
If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.
But you're not Princess Punchali.
Sheldon, are you hungry?
Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.
Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.
You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other.
Take it, Raj. It's more than I've ever gotten.
Drunk?
Please wait until I get into the hall.
Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
So you're not going to see her again?
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this  lamp. .
Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.
Because we can.
The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.

I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.
Are there any other honours I've gotten that I don't know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.
Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.
Oh, come on. The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.
Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.
So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
Alright, I don't care what you say, I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.
You forbid it?
Oh, you admit that it's our work.
Hey Sheldon!
Get anything good?
Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't. . It was a joke.  Yup, tip your waitresses, I'm here all week.
Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard…
Little misunderstanding, huh.
Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.
Well how do you feel?
Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
Wait… what?
You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out.
Which was?
Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.
Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but…
Uh, well no, no, not in… not in those words.
Um, gee, the exact words aren't written… it's more the spirit in which it's
Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don't….
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.
Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.
I don't know, I wasn't choosing my…
No, no not at all. A little bit.
Leonard, ready to go?
Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.
Bye Sheldon.
Any other questions?
I didn't skip it, it's just an anecdote. It's not science.
You are not Isaac Newton.
You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.
Really, so why did you come?
I didn't screw it up.
I've had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.
You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
Stop it.
You were trying to blow up my head.
It wasn't, it was not, you are a nutcase.

You're lucky I didn't run you over.
You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.
Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologise for?
What?
Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.
Skynet is kinky? I don't know.
Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…
What the hell is that?
Oh, I give up.
Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?
It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.
Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.
See you.
Yes, I did.
So?
Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.

What?
It's two o'clock in the morning
What?
What, what, what, what, what?
Sheldon, what is it?
What was I supposed to say.
Yes.
And what would I have said afterwards?
I couldn't say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.
It's the social protocol, it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.
Well now you are.
Yes.

Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?

Do you have any idea what time it is?
What do you want?
I remember symposium.
Wait, what?
Well imagine how I'm feeling.
You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.
Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.
Your cousin Leopold?
What's important?
I don't get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?
Un-unravelable?
Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.
We're going to Long Beach?
Oh, come on!
So he goes back into rehab?
You still told her I lied.
I don't know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
Okay. So what's up?
Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.
It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm…ian
Yeah, uh, break a leg.
Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.
Shotgun.

Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.
What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over.
Why not?
There is no Leo, how can you say that?
I've got a solution.
Get out.
Au contraire. I'm 26 years old, I'm originally from  Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I've often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.
Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.
Sheldon?
Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?
Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.
Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?
Hi. How did the intervention go.
Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.
The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.
That's never been proven.
Not double blind studies.
And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.
How long is he going to stay here.

O-o-o-o-h! Again?
Just reset the board.
Oh, better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.
Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.
Here we go.
Oh, the flu I guess.
Maybe Friday.
I… I don't…
Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.
Oh, it's okay, I understand.
No problem. Welcome home.
What the hell are you doing?
With lime jello?
I don't think so.
Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.
Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?
I'm going back to bed.
I mix pancake batter in this!
You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?

Hey.
I'm at work.
Yes.
Yes.
They asked me to come in.
They texted me.
Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
Drink whatever you want.
Then make soup.
I'm at work, Sheldon.
Yes,
Hello.
Howard's sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?
No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?
How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick.
Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.
Why didn't you just….  Why didn't you just have soup at home.
You can have soup delivered.
Okay, what kind of soup do you want.
We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.
No.

Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.
Okay, well, you feel better.
Um, home, to write some bad cheques.
Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?
Really, never?
Studying abroad?
And there was no-one there to take care of you?
Again?
What does that mean?
Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?
Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.
Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I'll see you later.
Oh, Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?
But Sheldon….
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Sorry.
What?
I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
Soft kitty, warm kitty…
Well, I had to, you see what he's like.
W-wait!
Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor.  Sheldon appears in his comforter.)
I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.
Yeah, so?

Lay it on me.
How about that.
Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
That is a problem.
And he's only fifteen years old.
I already know you're not. You don't have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.
Yes sir.
I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition… ooh, look, chocolate milk.
That.
Is this part of the tour?
Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.
Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.
You see where you went wrong, don't you?
Huh, yeah?
It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.
Have you considered it?
Wow, you won the Stephenson award.
Really, how old?
Sure. Raj, hug Howard.
Something you'd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
Antonio Salieri?
Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.
You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is.
Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?

Hey.
Great.
Great.
Great.
Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help.
Yes.
It would blow up.
Pretty sure.
Go away.
It's a small brown paper bag, Ma, I'm looking at it right now.  Why would I make that up, there's no ding-dong in it.  How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?
I'll talk to you later.
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.
A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle.
When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.
No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it's a shelf.
Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.
Sheldon.
Go away.
No, I thought of it all by myself.
Go away.
No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.
Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?
Oh, what are you working on?
To what end?
Who will come?
What if they don't come.
Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who's agreed to join us here at the University.
Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your… uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of… um… he's nuts.

Go away.
Please go away.
I don't think you mean we can't. I think you mean we shouldn't.
Could I have everyone's attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.
Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.
Did anyone see how he did it?
I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.
Good story.
What? Why?
Come on, you need a four person team, we're four people.
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you.
Outweigh the needs of the few.
I like it.
Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
Let's put it to a vote. All those in favour….
Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?
After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?
Yes.
Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.
Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.
Hey, I buzzed in.
Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging?
Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.
Because it's polite.
Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.
Some of us might have the correct answers too.
maybe we should take a little break.

Can it wait, I need to talk to you.
Why do they say AA?
Isn't that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.
No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!
Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you're off the team.
Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.
Yes we did, I just came from it.
Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team.
Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
Okay, let me try it this way, you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.
Thanks for the heads up.
Yes.
So nothing, let's destroy him.
Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting.
So, is that your team.
Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?
On what grounds?
Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope.  AA?
The answer is minus eight by alpha.
Answering question. Winning physics bowl.
Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears.
You didn't answer question.
AA, I need your official answer.
Then what is it?
You can't have a different question.
Denied.
Well, that's too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct.
Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team.
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.
My Physics Bowl Trophy!
I know someone who would disagree.
My Physics Bowl Trophy!  “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”
I'm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?
Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?  The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?
I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine's sexiest man alive?
Wait, I don't think it's Shatner.
Alright, singer who sang “Oops I Did It Again.”  Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?

What did they give you?
I don't believe it.
Yeah. And that's my bid.
You lucky duck.
A time share time machine? I'm in. Sheldon?

I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
Yes but the elevator's been broken for two years.
I can't feel my fingers, hurry up.
Sheldon?
I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.
You're joking, right?
Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it's not… never mind.

Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.
Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!
He's got a point.
That sounds fair.
Twice a month.
Okay, every other month.
So, when it's your turn you can.
Mrs Bell was deaf, she's not even going to hear you knock.
Ooh, how far into the future?
Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they'd given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this… this…
No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…
Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.

So?
Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
But it would make the present so much nicer.
What was your first clue?
Yes I'm upset.
Yeah, good for you.
I don't know. Maybe.
Uh, here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.
Thanks for pointing it out.
Oh, Leonard.

I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.
Just… personal reasons.
Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.
I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.
He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees.
Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.
Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.
Sheldon, get out of my way.
What the hell's going on?
What?

Sheldon, are you okay?
It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?
I'm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas.
Well, that should do it.
Oh, hey buddy.
Sorry I'm late, I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.
Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?
It's because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly.
Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and… I'm sorry what was your name again.
And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.
I guess that's why they call you a genius.
Oh, I don't think so. Shelly doesn't like company. Even as a little boy he'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.
Come on, Shelly, she's family.
Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.
I'll walk you to your car. You're in structure 3 level C, right?
Hee-hee, just classic.
He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.
Can I get a hallelujah.
Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?
Hell, no!
Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
Thank you.
Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?
That's fascinating, but I…
Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they're hitting on your sister.
That's great, but I….
Whatever. You have to do something about it.
Because she's your sister.
Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.
Uh-huh.
Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.
I'm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.
He's the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.
Say what?
I'm not happy, it's the medication, I can't stop smiling.
Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.
Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
Is it ‘cause I'm Jewish, ‘cause I'd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.
Oh really?
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?
Okay. I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
What on earth are you talking about?
And what do you mean, mediocre stock?
You have got to be kidding me!
Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God's special little people.
I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember?
Go on.

Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.
Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?
Yeah, I'll just tell her you said hey.
Come on, Shelly.  I want you to know I'm very proud of you.
Yup, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.
Well yeah.
What's the difference?
Goodbye Shelly.
Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  Right come on guys, come on.  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you…
So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?
Okay, he can have carrot cake.
I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody's until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.
Uh, that's so silly.
What was it called, “I hate my son and that's why he can't have cake?”
I know. I want to talk to you.
Okay, can you just let me in.
Okay, here's the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.
Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it. I'm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?
Anguish?
Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.
Nevertheless we are….
Okay, here's the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.
Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?

What difference does it make?
Is that Raj and Howard?
Can you just let us in.
Uh, Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
Don't ask.
Too late.
It's a non-optional social convention.
He came with a manual.
Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.
Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn't buy for themselves.
Well, it's a fun sweater, it's got a bold geometric print.
Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.

Um, that one.
Sure.
Oh, okay then this one.
I don't know, the man on the box looks so happy.
Oh, I know I'm going to regret this but, what trauma?
Of course.
No?
All of them.
Yeah.
Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?
Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we're getting, see, happy guy available.
Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?
I drive a Chevy Cavalier.
Sheldon, we have to go.

Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.
Sheldon, we have to go.
Well, for one thing, we're late for Leonard's birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security.
Keep walking.

No, it's Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon.
What's this?
Well it's not.
You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
Hey!
You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.
Why are you learning Chinese?
Oh, I'll tell you what's going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog.  Drop dead, you stupid self-centred bastard!  Thank you.
Okay, feel better, bye.  She doesn't want to talk.
I'm not going to do that, Howard.
What about “damsel in distress?”

For God's sake, Sheldon, if you don't like the tangerine chicken, don't order the tangerine chicken.
Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.
Just eat your tangerine chicken.

Sheldon.
I'm sorry. Look, do you have a second.
I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It's about Leonard.
Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.
All I'm saying is, you know Leonard the best.
Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment.
No.
Okay, so, here's the thing. I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out.
Oh, that's nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just… want to sit down?
Well, choose.
Alright, why don't you just pick one at random, and then if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.
Okay. Um, here's the thing. So, I've known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…
Alright, yeah, I don't really know who they are…
Yeah, I don't care, I don't care. The point is Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.
No. What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.
But on the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he's not looking for a fling, he's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don't know, like you would say light years.
Thank you for the clarification.
Right, thanks.
Not the first one I've made today.
Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about.
Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
Sheldon!
I'm sorry, I don't get the point.
Sheldon, what's the point?
Okay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard.
Two seats right there.
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.
No, it's about Penny.
I don't think I can go out with her tonight.
Other people would say “why not?”
I'm going to talk anyway.
Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.
Right.
Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it.
You're not helping.
Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
Wow, that's brilliant.

Crazy man. Call the police.
Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?
Well, we sort of decided to wing it.
Nice close up, by the way.
That's not a bad sign.
Hi.
Thanks.
Sheldon, may I ask you a question?
Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here's my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.
No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a braniac?
How is that not a braniac?
So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he'll eventually get bored with me.
On what?
No.
No.
Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.
Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn't want him to think I was some stupid loser.
You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.
Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.
Yeah.
What?
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
Oh Sheldon, please, look, I'm asking you as a friend.
Well, yeah.

You could be Batman?
Hey.
Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?
What does that mean?
No I didn't.
What's going on with you?
What's wrong with your face?
What?
Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…
Sheldon, I'm working.
Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?
Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?

What do you mean, you're moving out? Why?
Yeah, there kind of does.
I'm still confused.
That was fast.
Where are you gonna live?
Well you can't stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.
I hate trains.

Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
What?
Not until now.
Well, if you're not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…
Terrific.
Yes, isn't she an amazing actress.
How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench?
Do you want to switch?
Get out of bed, we're switching.
For God's sake, ma, I'm 27 years old. It's not even a school night!  Comfy now?
So don't look at it.
No kidding?
What about Lee Meriwether?
Well I'm glad that's settled.
Please, I'm begging you, go to sleep.
Oh for God's sake.
I'm coming!
Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's valium in it. But he still wouldn't shut up, so, tag, you're it.
I still don't know why you left.
Why not.
You promised Penny what?
What secret. Tell me the secret.
Not that secret, the other secret.
Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.
I promise.
So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her, that's ridiculous.

Please let it go, Sheldon.
You're nitpicking.
Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy. They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
Hi guys. Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair. I'm hoping.
By moving on, do you mean, she's going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?
Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.
Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?
You went out and bought linen?
What? I've dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.
What about Leslie Winkle.
Why?
I'd hit that.

How?
Hey, dummy.
Uh, sure.

Terrific.
I kind of have other plans tonight.
Well, the thing is, someone's coming over.
Sheldon, it's a date, I have a date coming over.
Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.
You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?
Yes.
Yes.
I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.
Sheldon? What are you doing?
Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?
Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don't you just go to a movie or something?
Yeah, why not?
Well then don't order popcorn.
Well why don't you go to a coffee shop.
They have other things.
I don't know, you know, cookies, pastries…
Yeah, sure.
Heya Penny. Dumbass.
Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they're both scientists.
Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.
Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?
Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there's the lactose intolerance.
Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.  What now?

Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
Sure.
Hmm, let's do it.
Don't make this hard for me.
Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know, I still don't understand why you just don't go to dinner or something.
Goodnight Sheldon.
Excuse me?
Okay, where is this coming from?
Your arch enemy?
Sheldon, come back, you're losing me.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
I know. I heard.
Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.
Are you going to let me talk?
You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.
Okay, let me put it this way, if you're really Leonard's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
Because love trumps hate.
Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.

If the word is pee-pee, just do it.
Thank you.
Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.
Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.
Sheldon, don't make that noise, it's disrespectful.
I'm sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker.
What's the bright side?

Yeah.

Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.
Yeah!
Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.
I can't get the damned key out.
Thankyou, Sheldon.
Why? I'll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?
I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven't got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven't gotten a raise at work, haven't even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.
Oh, sonofabitch!
I did, and he said he'll get here when he gets here.
No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly.
For God's sake!

Sheldor?
What are you doing?
Oh.
What's AFK?
OIC.
Oh, I see?

Oh, I don't know. Can I see them in another colour?
Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?
Okay.  Wait, wait, where are you going?
Want to catch me up?
Oh my God, a treasure chest, I'm rich!
Okay, look, I bought the game, and I've been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.
No, no, I've a bronze dagger.
Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?
Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
Thank you, I really appreciate this.
No, that's Marcie. Peppermint Patty's just athletic.
Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. .
Sheldon. (Sing-song) Shel-don.
No danger, look, it's just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?
Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.
Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?
Why not?
Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?
Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.
People, I am very busy today.
Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises.
No I don't.
It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.
You need to get that Dr Cooper?
Well don't turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you've been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year.
Excuse me. Gablehauser.  It's for you.

Why should I do something, you're the one who introduced her to online gaming.
Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
You mean, up until now we've been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?
Sheldon, wake up.
Afternoon men. Sheldon.
Right, I heard you've been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie.
Leslie, you are way off base here.
Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.
Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.
No.
Sheldon…
Uh…  Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I'm going in.
Got it.
22.
Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?
I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!
What?
Thank you.
That's on the registration?
Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I'm a big old five.
Hi.
Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
Chosen by science?
You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
This is bad.
Really, really bad.
Sheldon, what do you want.
Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don't know what they're doing, we've got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.
No, no, no, no, I need you now.
Sit over there.
Don't! Don't! Don't!
O-o-o-oh!
Why? Don't!
Well, wow, that's incredible.
Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
It's a lease.
Peer review? It's People magazine. People picked me.
The people from People.
Are you proud of yourself?

Hi Sheldon.
Well, we're going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.
Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren't very supportive.
You were a colossal ass-hat.
Really, do tell.
Okay, let's try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?
Come on.
And when we go in there, let's show Raj that we're happy for him.
Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I'm bigger than that.
Dr Hoffstadter.
I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.
Sheldon!
Sheldon.
You can stop smiling now.
It's fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They're going to digitally add a supernova, they say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.
Oh, you're welcome. Of course, I couldn't get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that's for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.
Sheldon?
And you guys aren't going? I can't believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not even going to be there to support him?
Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can't believe it took you a whole year.
Let's just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You're welcome.
Just sit down and eat.
Alright, it's shredded, what do you want me to do?
Sorry.
He's not going to have intercourse with Penny.
Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.
Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
Lucky?
Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.
So, not a puppy?
A griffin?
And mythological.
Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a good lion semen story, what's your point.
You want to breed a new friend?
That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.
And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.

Uh-huh.
I'm not going to work.
Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
No.
Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights, and that you'd have to make other arrangements.
And?
Goodnight, Sheldon.
Take the bus.
You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
Oh, you're a big boy, you'll figure it out.
Sheldon, what is it?
Thanks for the update
Yeah, uh, I really don't think I do.
Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.
Oh, dear God.

You know this is my day off, Sheldon.
Mm-hmm.
It's fine, it's been on for, like, a month.
Sheldon, it's fine.
Uh, maybe the light's broken.
What?
Do you have any alcohol?
Too bad.
Mm-hmm.
Well, good for Leonard.
No.
No.
How about we just have a little quiet time now?
Get out.
I said, get out.
I just got here.
Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can't drive you for the next few weeks.
No, just for the fun of it, I'm gonna take his side.
How did you get here in the first place?
Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
Over what?
I'm taking you home.
I have a better idea.
Sheldon, sit down.
So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.
Penny's taking you to the DMV, I'm going to bed.
All right, come on Sheldon.
What?
Okay.
Fine.
Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn't you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
Doing what?
Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!  Application?
The application in your hand, give it to her.
Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!
Look at that sign up there.
Does it say I give a damn?
That's because I don't.
Sheldon, it's C, just put down C.
Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!
Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?
Here's your learner's permit. Go away.
Next!
This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
I haven't configured it yet. Let's see… Bradley tank… transport truck…  Batmobile…
Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.
What?
Fine, what colour do you want?
Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.
Okay, fasten your seat belt.
How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
Aw, the pet store?
So wait,you're just gonna give up?
So what is it you're doing?
What does that mean?
I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.
No kidding.
Yes, you are, you're meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I'm sorry that the demonstration didn't quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don't. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?
Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
If you don't do this, I won't take you to the comic book store.
Oh, good God.
So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.
Because first-rate minds call you “dumbass”?
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I'm Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you're just brilliant.
Ew. Dr. Cooper, I've read everything you've published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?
Woof.
Again, ew. You know, I'd love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
Well, it doesn't have to be coffee. How about dinner?
Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.
Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
What if I brought food to your place?
You got it. I already have your address.
Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?
Uh-huh. The viewing area's right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona's here.
Oh, sorry I'm late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.
So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.
Hey, aren't you having breakfast?
Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
So, how'd it go with Ramona last night?
Here's your spinach mushroom omelette .
Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.
Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.
There won't be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.
So have you worked out the neutrino issue?
You're so witty.
Dr. Cooper is working.
Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali's. You coming?
You're not going to Halo night.
And who was that great man?
Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.
Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn't waste an evening playing video games.
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.
What do you think?
Now shall we get back to work?
Sheldon, honey, I've told you, it's a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.
Get rid of her how?
Excuse me?
Dr. Cooper?!
Hide you?
Why aren't you working?
Sheldon?  What are you doing?!
Why?
We are communicating through the wall.
I don't know Morse code.
Sheldon, I'm not going to learn Morse code at three o'clock in the morning!
Don't come in here, don't come in here, don't come in here, don't  Aw! What's going on?
I know. When is she going home?
What are you talking about?
That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that's taking over the Earth.
Good night.
The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who's been replaced with an alien pod.
Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
It's unbelievable! It's paradigm-altering!
Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.
Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?
I'm Nowitzki.
Uh-huh.
Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?
Great. I'll bring it to your place. I have the address.
Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?

You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.
Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?

Judge's ruling?
Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.
You sound just like the cable company. All right, so, shh, Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  America's Next Top Model.
No, no, don't tell her.
What do you mean, aw? Like she didn't know we were nerds?
Fine.
They're gorgeous.
Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.
To pay my cable bill.
Isn't it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I asked.
No.
Yes.
No.
Thank you.
Yes.
Put it on the agenda.
Oh, I'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it.
Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.
Penny! Penny did it.
I don't know. I was hungry? What's the big deal?
What?
A sports metaphor?
All right, yeah, I'll play along. What was my first strike?
I did?
Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats.
Come on, I touched one onion ring.
Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?
Well, what a thrill.
Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.
I don't care. I'm taking a stand. Metaphorically.
That's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.
Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover's pizza, no meat. Coming right up.
Oh, I didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don't like your attitude.
There you go, quesadilla, salad, there's your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
No, just try.
Voila!

Time to do your laundry, huh?
I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.
Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?
Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
Sheldon  Sheldon  Sheldon.
Where are my clothes?
Sheldon, where are my clothes?
How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
Get them down.
Never.
Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I've done some stupid things, you've done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.
Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?
A-a-a-aw!
Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I'll get him. Sheldon, it's for you.
Your mother.

Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that's, that's not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
Good night, Sheldon.
Yes?
Thank you.

I don't want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
I'll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
What?
Noticed the eye patch, did you? It's all part of a technique I've been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.

Well, I want to watch it now.
I saw what you did there.
Hello. Hey, Howard. What's wrong? Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.
Howard's at the Mars Rover lab. He says he's in trouble. Defcon 5.
What?
Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.
Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.
No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How'd you like to visit a secret government facility?”
I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she's here. She doesn't exactly have clearance.
My mother is so gonna love her.
Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.
You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA's latest timetable, they won't get there for 35 years.
Oh, snap.
Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.
Psst! Psst!
Well, that does sound like me, but no.
Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.
No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.
I can't tell you that.
I can't tell you that, either.
Yeah, I really didn't think this through.
What?
I don't know. Just tell them I went to the office.
No.
Just say, Leonard went to the office.
What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.
I'm going to the office.
Okay.
Okay, where is he going?
Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
Oh, hey, guys.
Sheldon.
That's just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
Sheldon?

Hey, Sheldon.
I'm sorry?
What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.
Please don't do that.
So, this wasn't the awkward part?
Oh, all right. S'u'up?
Okay, feeling the awkward now.
Yeah, Leonard told me.
To you?
Well, what about me?
Well, aren't you sweet?
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.
Really?
I could think about you.
Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
I stand corrected.
That's very interesting.
She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.
No.
Ih-uh, strawberries.
Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.
You're kidding!
Why, what-what-what happened?
I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?
Uh, Sheldon?
Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
Okay, here's my question, why did you sit down?
What landing party?
What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!
Hi, Sheldon.
What invitation?
Oh, clearly I could have.
No, it's fine. you know, he's sweet.
No, just sit here.

What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?
The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
Stephanie Barnett is single.
It's just her facebook page and we've only been going out a couple of weeks.
Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.
General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.
What?
This is a door knob.
Sheldon, would you like to come in?
No.
Sheldon, what do you want?
He's having problems with Stephanie?
What?
We never got to the bedroom.
Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I'll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.

I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
Oh, I don't think you can.
Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.
I'll tell you what you shouldn't do. Don't spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn't work at all, no matter how much you put on.
Oh, thank you.
No.
Well, thank you.
Yes.
What?
Leonard, you're going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.
What are you doing?
Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
By making constipated moose sounds?
Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
Oh, for god's sakes.
No, no, no, I got it.
No, I'm not. I'm bleeding.
Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.

I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.
I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
What?
Well, then who did?
You hacked my facebook account?
Are you insane? Now she's going to think I'm desperate. You've destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don't even understand what you did wrong because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.
I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.
Me, too.
Yup, there's no inflammation at all, Sheldon.
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
Okay, I'll be right in.
Do you understand that Stephanie's not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
Good night.
No, you're not.
Thank you.
We're not living together.
That's absurd.
Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
I'm going to bed.
No, absolutely not.
He did very nicely.
She's heard about you because we're, you know, involved and you haven't heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!
Thank you, Sheldon.
Look, I'm just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it's very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
Bye.
You know, she seems very nice.
Roommate? You guys are living together?
We're not living together.
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
Thank you.
I'm kinda busy here, Sheldon.
A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?
Go home, Sheldon.
Oh, no.
You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I've never seen anything like it.

What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?
Booya.
It's David Underhill. So what?
I have two words for you. The first is big, the other's whoop.
There are always do-overs when my people play sports.
Actually, I was…
Come on, it's just a video game. And we suck at it.
No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.
Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?
Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I'll just put them under my tree.
Uh-huh.
I don't know. ‘Cause it's Christmas?
Now, honey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.
Okay, you know what? Forget it. I'm not giving you a present.
Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun.
Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff, let's just go next door and build her a bear.
Come on, bath stuff, it's perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.
Excuse me, we're ready.
This one. Let's go.
I'm sorry. Uh, this one. Let's go!
Yes?
Excuse me?
Yippee.
Brilliant.
Do whatever you want.
Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.
Okay, here.
Turn it over.
Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.
Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.
Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.
Sheldon! What did you do?!
Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what's inside the Magic Eight Ball.
How about the toaster oven?
Gentlemen, goggles.
Yeah, well, it almost killed me.
So, who exactly does it want to kill?
Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you're a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.
Yes, we did, Kripke.
Come on, is that really necessary?
Oh, snap.
What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let's settle this woboto a woboto.
There's no guawantee we've gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let's thwow down. You know, unless you're afwaid.
Tomowow, thwee o'clock, the kinetics wab.
Sheldon, we have to call it off.
Oh, please, we've spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.
Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke's robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.
Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we've got to call this off.
But, Sheldon, we don't have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.
That's not overconfidence, that's observation.
Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.
I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.
That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?
Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
Go, go, go, go!
Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.
Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I've seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.
Sheldon, honey, aren't you getting a little carried away? I mean, it's just a toy robot.
Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.
Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?
Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…
Feel better now?
Fo' shizzle.
Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
Yeah?
I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Yeah, I got the same one. And that's not a bathing suit, it's a tan line.
Oh come on, really?
What is this?
Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?
Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?
Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
Thanks pal.
Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don't know, pleasant?

I answered every question Sheldon.
Aw, you picked up on that huh?
Come on! There's over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?
Hold on. I put some real work into that!
It's kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.
Sheldon, I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.
What I'm trying to say is that, maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?
On the floor.
Then why learn how to swim?
No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.
Where are we going?
Thank you.
Family.
Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people, I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.
Um, yeah but they're all for little kids.
Uh, I guess. They're right over there by the wooden train set.
I bet you do.
I don't like birds, they scare me.
Curious George.
Curious George is a monkey.
Sheldon, what are you doing?
Rebecca.
No you're not, let's go.
Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
Hear him out. If he's really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.
Yes, he's new at the zoo.
I can fix it.
Gee. Why can't Sheldon make friends?

Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.
You afwaid of heights, Cooper?
Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.
Let's go, Cooper.
Hey, look at you, Cooper. You're almost halfway to the top.
You alwight there, Cooper?
Are you saying you're stuck?
Understood all that. I'm not a mowon. Just keep going.
Well, then. Cwimb back down.
So what's the pwan, Cooper?
It's a little thing but you really do miss it.
He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.
Sheldon, are you okay?
What's that?
Me, me. Let it be me.
Can I whistle?
Guilty as charged. I'm out.
Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist. So just…
He had Lysine but changed it.
Suddenly I'm looking pretty good, huh?
I'm sowy. No, my fwiend?
No, that's wong. There's an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.
Hmmm.
We've got to be missing something. Let's start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.
Why? They're state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.
What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
We could eat after the movie.
Wow. I don't see how we missed that.
Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?
Later, dude.
Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.
Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.
Is Leonard around?
The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven't paid my rent.
It's no big deal. I'm just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
Well the “check engine” light is fine. It's still blinking away. It's the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
Yes, it occurs to me, too.
Wow, you got a lot of money in there.
Don't be silly.
No, I can't.
Well, yeah, but…
But what if you need it?
Really? I mean, are you sure?
Are they working on that?
Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can't. Sheldon honey, I don't want things to be weird between us.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

Interesting.
Do I have to?
Why?
Great. I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
No.
Yes.
Stop it!
Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.
Okay, whatever. It's not like I'm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?
Weird.
Did you guys have an argument?
Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.
It was fourteen fifty, but it's okay.
Yes, dinner's here, and I'm having some. I'm having takeout food.
You're damn right it's okay. I've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.
Going home, where I won't be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.
Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?
You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there's real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.
I do.
I'm not afraid of him.
Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?
Well?
Guys, there are four of us and one of him.
No. What do you want?
Sheldon, not now.
No, the problem isn't solved. He just blew us off.

Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.
Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.
No.
Bye.
Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
Great.
Can't we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
No, I didn't realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.
Aren't there any other options? There's not a lot of room, it's gonna be uncomfortable.
I'll start again.
Oh, I don't know where he would've gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.
Yes, we think so. We've both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.
Here's your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?
I'm sorry, it's on my other laptop.
His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.
Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.
Sheldon, you don't give your mother enough credit. She's warm, she's loving, she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.
You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.
Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I'll have to try again later.
But it's one o'clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o'clock.
You always say that, but we never do.
Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.
Common complaint among men. Nothing's ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.
Oh, I'll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.
Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.
Understandable.
I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it's probably you.
I feel very comfortable around you, too.
Nor I.
Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?

I'm very tempted. I'm just not sure it's appropriate with my son's roommate.
True. I've had a similar observation. It's certainly something I could never do with my husband.
I see what you're doing. You're appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.
But what about the creek bed?
Well, that's it then, we're doomed.
No, that shouldn't be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They're probably just all staring at the sky.
Why don't I run away and you cover me?
Yeah, more cutbacks.
You know what baffles me, Sheldon?
Yeah, okay, but what's with the back-scratching and the meow!
Thank you.
Are you done?
In the paintball shed! Twice!
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
How can I calm down? I'm gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That's three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
Hello, Sheldon.
Are you planning on sitting here?
Then what difference does it make?
Here we go.
Fine.  Happy?
Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It's a little chilly.
Isn't that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
Don't you dare, missy.
What do you mean?
Why don't you just eat in your desk chair?
Here we go.
You know, there's kind of an obvious solution here.  Get up.  There. Problem solved.  Nobody cares where you're going to sit. You're not crazy.
Why not?
Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.
Why are you crouching there?
Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.
There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.
Sit on the damn couch.
Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.
Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
Golden Dragon.
Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.
I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
Oh, God, I wish I had.
Yeah, buddy?
Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we'll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.
What the hell?
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.
Screw that.
He's right. You can't.
Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.
Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.
Okay, then we won't touch the hard drive. We'll just erase the first season of Battlestar.
Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.
Of course I haven't.
It's kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.
Yeah, I wish.
Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we're taking the train.
Hey, we're all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?
What are you doing?
Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?
Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.

Whatever it is, I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.
What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
Why not?
It's not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.
Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil Terminator.
Thank you.
At least he's off the train crap.
My money's on tuck and roll.
That's Summer Glau.
Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?
Yeah-yeah, which way?
You're going to need more than 11 hours.
What's the matter?
So?
Okay, Sheldon, I'm going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.
Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back.
Right. Of course.
Well, there's nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.  So, where you gals headed?
I've got a better idea.
Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Penny's home. Why don't we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?
So?
So?
So?
I see. Well, it seems once again, you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.
Yeah, we're putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on.  Hello?
Just a sec.  The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I'll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I'll see you then.  Hello?
Your dresser? Who is this?
Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?
Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what's up?
He's calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn't use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.
Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.
You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he's one of those geeks.
Placebo, you say. Interesting.
Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.
Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?
Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.
Thank you.
What up, Moon Pie?
Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?
Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we're making out?

With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?
Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.
Why?

Hey, Sheldon.
I know. You're safe.
What?
What is it?
Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.
It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I'm doing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.
No, I'm making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.
Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off, I won't have to be a waitress anymore.
Another waitress.
I don't know.
Fine, cheeseburger.
So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?
About twenty.
I don't know, like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.
That's all?
Well, I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.
And you know about that stuff?
Who's Radiohead?
Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?
Sheldon, wait! Will you?
Yes.
I understand.
Okay.
Oh, imagine that.
There. Done.
Pretty good, right?
That just can't be right.
No, sorry.
Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.
Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.
All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?
W-W-Wait, what's going on?
Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.
Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
You're kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.
She'd need some kind of industrial cooling system.
Actually, I'm thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.
I've got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.
Well, what's wrong with my apartment?
Okay, what's wrong with it?
Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.
You want to fire me?
Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.
We add Bluetooth!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?
The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.
And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to call them and cancel the order.
I just don't see how see can pull this off.
They didn't quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.
Oh, God, we're never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?
So?
Nicely done.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah… Sheldon? Sheldon!
Honey, do you want some coffee?
Come on, but if you don't stay awake we'll never finish in time.
Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.
Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.
Here, this will help.
Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.
We're all out.
Okay, it's done. Look, guys, for the future, I don't mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.
Sheldon, it's not that bad.
Shh-shh-shh!
No!
Why would you just say something like that?
Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don't just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.
Sheldon, I'm sure it's going to be fine.
Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?
Well, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.

You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
Hey, Penny, it's Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.

Stay calm, we don't know anything about them yet. What are you doing?
The box says kitchen.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, it is.
Hello.
Freakishly feline?
Sheldon…
You're making her uncomfortable.
What?!
I have no immediate plans.
Pro?
Yes?
I can see.
Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this. I'm going jogging.
I can start.
Thank you, Sheldon.
See ya. I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

Hey.
Well, sort of.
I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?
Oh. all right, that's cool, no biggie. He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?
Oh, they're all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.
Okay, now I see the giant squid head.
Well, they're all still up there.
I don't even know why I care. I don't care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that's all I care.
What are you saying, that I'm threatened by Alicia? That I'm like the old queen of the hive and it's just time for me to go?
No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes
…chinese food right here.
I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle's house in Orange County to pick up her TV?
Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I'm telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.
Please.
You're right, this filly's been broken.
Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.

Problem?
Here we go.
Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Sheldon, we agreed we'd do something different tonight.
We went to the comic book store last night.
Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies? We're eventually coming for you!
Oh hey, guys, where're you headed?
You got me. While you're there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?
I don't know, he's 13. Just pick out anything.
Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
Ugh, that's what I was trying to avoid.
Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?
Oh, great.
What's a multiverse?
Let it go, Sheldon.
Yes, but I saw it from the front.
Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
You let go.
Problem?
It's my comic book!
I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
All right. So, um, just give me a call.
Apparently so.
No.
When did you pick up on that?
Sure, why not?
Gee, thanks a lot.
I don't need any insights. I just want to know why Penny's more interested in Stuart than me. We're practically the same guy.
You're right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.
It's Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?
Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.
Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so…
We're having coffee.
Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What's the topic?
Ooh, Sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.
Of course it is. It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.
Oh, great!
I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.
Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn't make you right.
Plus, you're forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.
No, I'm tired.
Fine. You win.
Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?
You got it.
Leslie Winkle. You've reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.
No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.
Alright, back to the game.
Are you Spock?
She dumped me!
I don't know. She just said Howard, momma's a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.
I don't want to go anywhere.
Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?

Hello, Sheldon.
Great.
Really? Are you drunk?
That's Superman's big ice thing, right?
Mmm, what smells so good?
Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.
Have fun, Sheldon.
Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.
So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.
Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
In your apartment.
Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren't home, and I forgot it there.
It's not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.
Alright, Sheldon, let's just calm down and we'll call the building manager, he'll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you're waiting.
Yeah, why not?
Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don't have to.
Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…
Oh, God, I don't know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?
Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?
What?
Where did that even come from, did he say we were?
No, just mail, no benefits.
Why are you asking?
Well, some people just can't handle that kind of relationship.
Excuse me?
Sheldon, I really don't want to talk about this with you.
Of course it's making me uncomfortable, can't you tell?
I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!
I don't think the manager's coming tonight so, here.
Well, it wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind, but it's the one I'm going with.
What?
Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.
Only if it doesn't rhyme.
What?
Maybe that's because your hole is still open.
Your home is twenty feet from here.
Damn it. What do you want me to do
That's only for when you're sick.
Come on, do I really have to?
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um…
Sleepy ki…
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
Yeah.
What were you doing at Penny's?
Is that supposed to be funny?
He's right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.
Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It's mind-blowing.
I didn't spoil anything.
I'm sorry.
‘Cause we're going out again tomorrow.
No.
Oh. It's Stuart.
He wants to talk about Penny. I don't want to talk about Penny.
Why would he call me?
I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.
No! There, it went to voice mail.
No.
It must be hell inside your head.
Guys, we have a code red.
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.
Yeah, see, that's the code red. It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?
It wasn't bad advice. It just wasn't particularly helpful.

Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.
Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
What if we reposition the collection tank?
Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?
Hang on, I think I've got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
Comic book store.
Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
Damn right it's heavy, it's my mother's meat loaf, it's been testing toilets for generations.
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one.
Well, they've deployed our solution. Let's just all hope it works.

What?
Then what was oh, boy?
There's nothing wrong with the science here.
Okay, how's that?
Why?
Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning.

Sheldon, it's two o'clock in the morning.
Everybody?
You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night?
You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I'm talking to.
Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.
Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
Okay, well, do you want to go?
Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.
Maybe.
Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.
Well, then don't go.
All right, then go.
Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
How was it resolved?
Our dreams are very small, aren't they?
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Godspeed.
Ooh, I don't like where this is going.
To the North Pole?
Is this just so we won't touch your stuff while you're away?
Really?
We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
Well, I'm a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!
Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.

Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.
What?
You're all going?
For three months?
Excuse me.
Oh, hey, no, you don't have to apologize. There's no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.
Did she seem upset to you?
No.
A little bit.
I mean, I know she's not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?
Where are your tools?
For this I went to MIT.
Hang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
What is it?
Okay, why?
Sheldon, you know I can't eat butter. I'm lactose intolerant.
So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?
Sheldon, Sheldon?
Sheldon, it's me.
Listen, I don't know if I can go on the expedition.
I don't think I can go to the North Pole.
Yeah, that's very comforting.
Terrific, it's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go.
Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
It's a blanket with sleeves.
Yes, obviously.
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?
So, I can't go.
You really think so?
We're out of ice.
Yeah, wow.
Dinner's ready!
Reconstituted Thai food.
Check.
Check.
Uh, oh, sorry.
There's no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.

I'm going to go let Penny know we're back.

Thanks.
We have to tell him.
Damn his Vulcan hearing.
Okay, Sheldon, sit down.
Yeah, we'll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.
That's why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.
He just went colon, capital O.
It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
Actually, it was his idea.
Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it's… don't ask.
Do not make a sound.
Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.
Oh, this is ridiculous. What?
Because when he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.
Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it's no big deal.
Hey. Do you want to talk?
Oh, hon… Uh…  Soft kitty, warm kitty…
Oh. Sorry. I don't know your sad song.
Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.
Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol' slutbag.
Well, they're pretty tasty.
Look, Sheldon, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it's like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true, like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?
Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?
Come on. We said we were sorry.
Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.
That's not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.
Off a cwiff.
Compwetely wecked.
Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein's cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you're still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.
Here you go, Shelly.
Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.
This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all…
Give us, Lord, our daily…
Please know that we are truly…
For every cup and every…
Amen. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Whatever. Jesus still loves you.
Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he's Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?
All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.
Oh, good. I've been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.
You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone's entitled to their opinion.
And that is your opinion.
Sheldon, you're wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.
Give it up, dude, you're arguing with a crazy person.
Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?
What's there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.
Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
That's because in your dreams you're a horse from the waist down.
Sheldon, dinner's here.
No, we went somewhere new.
No, look, Mumbai Palace.
I don't know
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard's got one and you don't.
Sounds like a cricket.
How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you're wrong about the cricket.
Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that's an ordinary field cricket.
What's the matter, you chicken?
Chickens can't climb trees
Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don't buy. Bet me.
I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.

Shh! Elevator shaft.
Let's open her up.
Don't push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.
Be careful.
Stairwell.
Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?
What would you name him?
All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast's Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.
Shiksa. Shik-sa.
Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you're wrong again.
Yeah, well, I don't like bugs, okay? They freak me out.
Don't knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world's leading expert on the dung beetle?
Who wants to know?
Couldn't wait, huh?
I'm from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.
Yes!
Young man, I've been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.
Let me show you something. See that? That's a Crawley's dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that's a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can't. That tramp took me for everything!
Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?
What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can't be very popular.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm not feeling so hot either.
I don't know, empathy? Anyway, I'm just saying that you're feeling upset about something with Howard, and I'm upset about something with Leonard.
What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?
Okay, forget the chicken.
No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.

Hey. What's going on?
Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
Right, right. You're saying you talked to Penny?
Interesting.
Excuse me.
Little bit.
Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.
Why not?
Are you fun in any of them?
All right, want some French toast?
Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.
Morning.
Sorry. I haven't given her your schedule yet.
We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.
No, her bed kind of… broke.
Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass.
You know what, I give up. He's impossible.
Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.
I'm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
It's a…
I know. What are the odds?
Sheldon! it's an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?
Fine, whatever. Are you finished?
What was that?
It does. But in my experience, you don't.
They're called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.
Really?
Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.
Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.
Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip.
Okay, I know what you're doing.
Yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
No, I don't want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat.
Well, you shouldn't.
No, you're not sanding Penny.
Yes, you're forbidden.
What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
You're not squirting her in the face with water.
Forget it.
I'm not. And Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.
You're not changing how Penny laughs.
Uh, sorry guys, that girl is  freaky!
Freaky.
Yeah, freaky.

Of course.
Let's go.

What do you mean?
Ooh, we're honey now, are we?
You're boring people sweetie.
Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
Oh. I'll be there.
I guess I could serve both.
What do you mean, he's getting deported?
Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.
Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
Hello Sheldon.
I'm sad.
What are you eating?
We believe cows are gods.
Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out, I swear to cow!
Me, too. I'm just, I'm a little on edge.
Thank you.
I'm on it.
Yeah.
Tell you what, we'll skype.
Hey.
No.
Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?
You want me to work with you?
Okay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way, but I'd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
Sheldon, are you busy?
Shall I wait?
I've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
Thank you.
Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
Wha… You're kidding!
All right.
Come on, dude, we've been friends for years.
Sheldon, for God's sakes, don't make me beg.

Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.
Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.
Sheldon.
I need an aspirin.
Thank you.
Yes.
No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we'd expect from this collision. Do you understand that we're talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?
I'm the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I'd be kicking your butt.
Okay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!
My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.
It means doo-doo.
Aha! So I am working with you.
Ah, well, in this context…
Okay. Here's where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
Let me finish.
I'm not defacing it, I'm fixing it.
No.
Come and get it.
You are not my superior.
I'm busy.
What do you want, Sheldon?
So you were wrong.
For you or with you?
All right, but I have some conditions.
I'll take the job. See you Monday.
How did you get here?
So walk home.
Which one?
How could he ruin the game?
Sheldon, that is incredible.
Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
Yeah, I don't remember that.
Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?
Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?
But you have a whole bunch of 'em.
Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?
Why don't I just tell you what I heard today.
Saturday night at the comic book store, they're having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.
What about the money?
But this is other money.
Half of it will be mine.

Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine's coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?
All right, I won't set one aside for you.
Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?
Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you're playing in the tournament. Sign here.
Ooh, it'll be like a reunion then. Sign here.
Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.
Okay, I get it, he's a bad guy. Sign here.
No doubt, sign here.
Sheldon, it's your play. Sheldon.
Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!
You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It's a totally different set of characters.
Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we'll face off for the championship.
Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It's really lame.
Underworld guardian.
Invisibility spell.
Water nymph.
Two-headed tiger.
Sulphur.
Hang on.
I think he's got me.
What?
You went to the '95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.
Yeah, it was. But I'm really sorry that I disappointed you.
It's special relationship, isn't it, between a boy and his grandmother?
Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
I call my mee-maw nana. And she's going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie.
That was fun.
Kites, ho!
Oh, yeah. It's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.
Well, this sucks.
Leonard just realized that Penny's been hiding him from her friends because he's a tiny, little man who flies kites.

Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?
Maybe Koothrappali's right, maybe I embarrass her.
Sorry.
Wait, what are you doing? I can't scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!
So, Penny doesn't want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?
Oh, how kind of her.
With a woman you were chasing through a park? That's not a shot, that's a felony. What's worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don't suppose there's any chance you could give me my kite back?
Sacks, sacks…
Huh… Scrimmage…
Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
Unbelievable.
So you could teach me?
Football. I'm going to Penny's on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don't want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It'll be fun.
Yes.
I really appreciate this.
I'm sorry?
When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
What's wrong with a football jersey?
I's the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can't believe they had one for dogs.
Anyway, wish me luck.
Yeah, okay, like you said.
Good-Bye, Sheldon.
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at.
I know. I just need you stop talking.
Sheldon, come in.
There's some in the fridge.
On Earth, we say thank you.
Mimesis?
What the hell are you talking about?
Oh, I guess so.
I don't want to fly kites, Sheldon. We're watching football here.
Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.
All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.
Yay.
Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don't think we can play on Sunday.
My friend, Justin.
Who is this Justin?
No, you didn't.
Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he's coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.
Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
What was your first clue?
I'm not talking to you like you're an idiot! I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!
How is that not talking to me like I'm an idiot? It's my friend, it's my couch, and it's my freakin' life!
I heard of 'em. Didn't know they were a band. Sheldon, she's gone. You can turn off the blender.
No, we just had a little spat.
I don't get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.
An old boyfriend who's definitely not gay. That's what a guy likes to hear, definitely.
And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I'm cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn't matter if you're cool or not because I'm Penny and I'm pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you're doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I'm doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!
What?

Calm down, we'll make the movie.
Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.
Hey. We're, uh, going to the movies.
Not really, no.
Yeah, I don't think I need my preshow urination anymore.
Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.
You brought your mother into this!
Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Is Leonard coming?
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Which is?
I'm busy.
Fine. What do you want?
Yes.
No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.
Okay, fine, it's soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?
Great.
Don't you usually get lemonade?
Do you want lemonade?
Anything else?
I am not going to apologize. I've done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.
Leonard is wrong.
I'm coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I've committed?
Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you're making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?
My singing?
Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn't he just said so?
Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!
Hey.
Sure.
What?
Leonard!

Come on, Sheldon, let's go home. Look, we're done fighting.
Okay, there's going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.
You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?
Buy him the robot, Leonard.


Sheldon help!
Come in! Hurry!
I'm back here.
Get in here! Hurry! Don't you dare knock.
I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.
What?
I know. I slipped.
What?
Uh-huh.
Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.
Okay, can you drive me?
Well, I can't drive!
Ow.
No, no, no, I can't wait that long, you got to help me, please.
No one's saying that. Let's go.

I don't need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.
One was already in an accident.
Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!
Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
No… No… Oh, that's cute.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Yeah, great.
Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.
Is that my arm?
Then, maybe you should let it go.

You have your learner's permit, right?
Good.
All right, can we please go?
It's right there.
In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?
Could you please drive a little faster?
Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
No. The light has been on since I bought the car.
It's not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.
Oh, god, I'm gonna lose the arm.
What?
It's not soup, it's courage.
How did you see it? You said you wouldn't look.

I dislocated my shoulder.
You ready know that.
No.
Getting one.
No.
Change migraine to yes.
Oh, next question.
Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?
Ass.
Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don't know, comforting?

Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I'd say that.
You know, people think you're this weird robot man who's so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it's like that movie Wall-E at the end. You're so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.
Sing “Soft Kitty” to me.
Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.
The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
Hey, Cooper, I hear you're going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.
My pweasure.
Very cool, congratulations.

Excuse me, I have a master's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.
Hey.
All right, you know what, I will tell you why it's wrong…
What?
Thank you, Sheldon.
Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.
Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?
Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.
How ya doin', buddy?
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
You laughed.
I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.
Are you really admitting defeat?
Good.
That's true. He didn't just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham's water supply.
No, no.
Okay, uh, that's the spirit, but, um, let's dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.

What's this?
Foamy vengeance.
This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke's office?
Let me guess, motion sensors?
I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.
And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
Well, how could you not put in an abort?
At least they don't know it was you.
Hey, Leonard, check this out.
I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
You want me to put it back?
What's up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.
Sure. The more, the merrier.
Sheldon…
Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.
Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.
Oh, great selection, great prices.
That's amazing.
Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.
Yeah?
What?
Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.
And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.
Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?
It's not about shoes.
Um, actually, can we do it in private?
Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here's the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?
Yeah, okay, cool. I don't need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.
Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.
You're sitting here playing video games all day.
Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.
Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.
Great! It's a little insulting, but great. I'll be KoKo.

Hey, Sheldon.
Ready to get started?
Um, I don't have one.
There's gonna be a test?
Thank you.
Ancient Greece?
Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?
Twenty six hundred years?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Not for twenty six hundred years.

Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?
Sorry.
I don't know.
Hey! You don't have to be so mean!
No, you just suck at teaching.
Oh, God, Sheldon, look I'm trying to understand, but you're going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?
Not that far back!
I don't know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
Damn it!
Squared?
Aristotle?
Then I don't know.
Because I'm stupid!
Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?
Really? That's it? Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.
Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?
Thank you.
Oh, balls.
Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.
You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?
So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.
What is it?
Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.
Here we go.
Merry Newton-mas, everyone.
No, it's fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.
No, he doesn't.
Yeah, you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.
Well, I just, I thought…
It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.
Yes, dear. Mommy's proud. I've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.
Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?
I don't really like flowers.
Well, I would assume it's because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.
No. Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?
Why? I'm not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?
Not the time, Sheldon.
It's all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard's not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.
Mitzy's dead?

I don't want tea.
Then why are you telling me?
That's a lousy conversation starter.
What do you want, Sheldon?
I want that too. Why are you here?
Thank you, that's very comforting.
It's not?
You're right, I do feel better.
You're my surrogate family?
That's the Del Taco.
Thank you for taking me to the airport.
Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you'll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.
Thank you.
I think it's best that you not know.
Yes, actual women are the best.
Seen it.
Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?
We do?
I don't want to do that.
What about me?
Dude, there's so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it's a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy's. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.
Race riots?
Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don't we just go to the galleria and walk around?
No. We would just walk around and see what's what.
Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.
Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let's go outside. Outside is good.
I don't know, it's a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I'm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
Oh, boy.
I don't want to go to Flatland.
Oy.
Sheldon, I'm begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don't want to go alone.
What?
Thanks for coming with me.
Did you really have to bring it in with you?
Come on, let's get a drink.
Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I'll have a screwdriver, please. Don't be chintzy with the screw.
Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.
He'll have a Shirley Temple.
Okay, let's check out the females.
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife, she's like 80 years old.
No. I'm looking for a hookup.
You help me run my game.
Okay. What is your game?
Hey, that's pretty cool. What is it?
You're very funny. I'm Abby.
Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.
Hello.
Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?
Oh, that is so awesome.
What's going on?

What was that?
जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That's Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?
I don't get it. You had a great time.
Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she'll only come over if she can bring Martha.
My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
You can't wear the hands on the date.
Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Sheldon?
Listen, they're kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.
No, I'm not jealous. All right, I'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid. Now, can we order?
So what? It's the same food.
So?
Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?
It's obviously a typo.
You know what? Let's just get a pizza.

And why is that?
What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
What the…?
So are our laptops.

We like games.
Assorted video games.
What?
What about me?
I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.
We're done here. Call this number, and we'll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.
Do you have any more information that might be relevant?
What are we supposed to do now?
Does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect?
I'm not scared. I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.
Hand me the bat.
It won't happen again, what's up?
We're fine, Sheldon.
Mm-hmm.
Who is it?
Yes?
Yeah.
Yes, we are. And we're about to go to bed.
Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?
What do you want?
But you don't like other people.
Did we win? Can we go to bed?
Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you're feeling insecure, but we've really got to go to sleep.
Just gonna take a look around outside.
No, Jim, don't open the door!
Don't worry, there's no one out here.
All right, we've got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.
There's a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
Sorry, let me help you.

God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?
It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.
What are you doing? Use the door.
Great, you do that.
I'm lactose intolerant.
No, thanks.
Sheldon, are you okay?

Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
Come on, Sheldon, you can't move. Don't you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?
Oh, no, he's going to telecommute. Everybody's really excited about it.

Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?
Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That's part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.
They call themselves Bozites?
Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm going to miss you.
Sheldon, that's so…

Help you with your bags, sir?
Hey, look who's back!
Whatcha doing?
Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You've been up all night?
Yes.
And you're stuck?
Mmm, he's either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Maybe you need a fresh start.

Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
No, it's okay. I don't have to go. I'm happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I'm a walking brown Yelp.com.
I thought I smelled popcorn.
Hey, those are my lima beans!
Here, you want my peas?
Want my corn?
Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I'm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
Oh, my God! Are you…
Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
With marbles?
Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don't get enough REM sleep?
Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.
I'm going to count to three. One…
Yeah, well, he's extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?
Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?
No, I don't think so. We need to go home now.
If you don't come out of there, I'm going to have to drag you out.
For God's sakes. Sheldon, come here!
What! What, what, what?
What?
And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
Because we didn't want to be disturbed.
Sheldon, what do you want?
Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
Oh.
Yeah, I'm going to need a little more.
Keep going.
So, you're going to go work at the patent office?
Sounds like a great plan.
Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
Leonard doesn't snore.
So, Mr. Cooper, you're looking for a job.
Why, thank you for noticing. I'm Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?
No.
No.
I didn't really have to. So, how about construction?
No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.
Good.
Yes?
Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?
Do you have your own car?
Of course you don't. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?
Okay, I'll get those drinks started for you.
Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
Sheldon, wait, this isn't even what I do. I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?
Double guacamole?
Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
You understand why I'm doing this to you?
Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn't either.
Sheldon, where are you going? Aren't you going to clean this up?
Dude, I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don't?
Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There's a $39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.
Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
In any case, they're asking me to fill in for him.
No way, dude!
Sheldon, you got a minute?
Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland.
Penny.
Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
Yeah, well, I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day with a girl since I was six.
Oh, my God, Leonard! That's incredible!
My Rabe-what-ly?
Sheldon, we've been through this. I'm taking Penny.
Not the roommate agreement.
Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.
Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?
No.
Look, Sheldon, I know it's in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.
It is.
Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it's gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what'll cheer you up, let's play one of your driving games.
You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
Come on, Sheldon. Can't you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
Rupert Murdoch?

What's going on?
You made Frodo pancakes?
Why are you doing this?
Thanks. It's good.
You hate Babylon 5.
Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.

Hello.
Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.
Better acoustics for your throat singing?
Oh, for God's sakes.
I'm sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
Okay, show's over.
Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.
I'll talk to Leonard.
Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.
You're welcome.
I think we're there.
Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
Some what?
You're not going to Switzerland!
She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it's Penny, not you!
I don't need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.
Yeah, really.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Why don't you enlighten me?
Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she's not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you're still interested, you're welcome to come.
Here's your soup.
Yes.
Why don't I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.
Yeah, well, I'm sick, too.
I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.
Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.
No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan's doing him a favour.
Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
I can't decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom.  Alex, I'm going to go with what is… you're a dumbass?
That's crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.
That's a great idea, I'm going to get him to sign a Batman as well.
Well, obviously you don't remember your circumcision.
He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?
But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don't you put it in the bank?
You've also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
I'm sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
Sheldon, this is a summons.
Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.
No, it isn't.
No, it isn't.
Mmm, no, it isn't.
Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn't driving and they were all, if it wasn't you, who was it?
No! It wasn't a betrayal. It was more of a can't afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
It's not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
You are guilty. (Raj's shirt plays the gavel sound from Law & Order) That one I liked.
Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.
Oh, that's right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.
Whoa! What do you mean all?
Yeah, okay. No.
That's what I'm saying.
Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice it would've been a much shorter movie. No.
Oh, balls.

Penny.
All right, let's go.
What is this?
Do I have a choice?
Darn tootin', I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.
The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever.
Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.
But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally.
Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?
I know what it means. I went to law school.
The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.
Impressive.
Guilty. Pay the cashier.
No, I'm following the law. I'm ignoring you.
Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I'm going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.


What?
Knock yourself out.
Well, it ain't a wishing well.
Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?
Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.
I'm going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.
Except for Raj.
Okay, I realize that…
Okay, maybe you'll have another chance to have…

I see. And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited?
You know, you fan boys are unbelievable. Do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want? I mean, why don't you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?
Hey, where've you been?
Sweet.
Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
Oh, no, you didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?
Who's Adam West?
That is so sad.
You see what you're doing? Stop that.
What?
It's even got the Elvish engraving on it.
Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn't a replica. It's the real deal.
No, but it's close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.
No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.
How is this maritime salvage?
All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can't just be a coincidence.
What are you doing?
Look, let's be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.
You always get your way.
This ring.

So, Sheldon, how's it feel to get beaten up by a girl?
You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn't want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I'm sending it back. Where's the ring?
Give me that.
And it wasn't when we were driving like this?
If you're offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother's boobies.
Why don't we go after your mother?
You're right. Let's talk about your grandmother.
Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
Then let go of the ring and walk away.
All right. I'll bet your Meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.
We're getting to him.
What?
What are you doing?
It's, it's not working, dude.
Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…
We stand up.


My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I'd be very nervous around James Cameron.
Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science.
Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that. You.
You won.
Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.
Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.
What?
Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.
What, to you, is a large crowd?
That's no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen's court.
Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.
Where's 70 children when you need ‘em?
I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?

Sit down, we want to talk to you.
Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.
We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.
Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?
Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.
I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don't know, some Indian meditation crap.
My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that's 24-7, buddy.
So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?
Okay, Sheldon. I'm going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.
True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.
What?
I'm not going to punch you.
Do you want to do this or not?
All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.
Whatever you like.
Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.
Then, put on a sweater.
Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.
You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
All right. You've paid for a sweater, and you're in Sheldon Square.
What now?

It'll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I'm feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.
Yeah, that's when I buy shoes. Now, let's see what we've got. Ooh! This is nice.
Yeah, so?
Fine. Why don't you pick out what you like.
No, you're wrong.
Where the hell d'you find that?
It's ridiculous.
Please just try this one on.
So, Sheldon, how you doing?
Um, I don't know, maybe.
How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
Why don't we just talk?
Why don't I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that's what's happening here?
But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n' Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.
Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
It wasn't my fault. I had never seen my brother's project. And my mother could've told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
Damn right, I'm angry with my mother. For God's sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That's when the bed-wetting started again.
For what?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year's Chancellor's award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I'd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon's mother, who couldn't be here tonight. Isn't that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She's proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That's what she calls him. Shelly, it's a pet name. You know what my mother's pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of…
What's the matter?
Don't worry. You're surrounded by your C-Men.
Here, drink this. It'll relax you.
Fine, faint.
First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn't hear me. If you'd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I'd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.
Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Sure.
You might want to check YouTube.
All right, people, let's get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body's in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.
Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.
What's with him?
Are you saying he's man-struating?
Big or small, I don't like rabbits. They always look like they're about to say something, but they never do.
Would that be a giant rat's ass?
Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.
I don't want to talk about it.
You guys still on for bowling tonight?
Oh. Ouch.
Oh, hey.
No, no, it's okay. I mean, let's face it, you guys would get creamed without me.
It's always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.
Thinly veiled contempt.
Got it.
Bite me!
I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
Then what's with the disinfectant?
Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?
You're not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?
It tells me that I am living rent-free right here . You ready to bowl?
Great. Then it's on.
What?
Ice cream?
Um, Ach.
Did Leonard send you over here?
Again, I'm sorry.
You're kidding.
All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?
Oh, honey, I don't know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.
No, no, that's okay. Just let me talk to him, and I'll get back to you.
I don't know.
You're not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?
Yes, that's what I'm telling you. We are good. We are great.
The Wesley Crushers?
Still don't get it.
Okay, I'm sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.
You know, if you want it to mean you're crushing Wesley, it'd be the “Wesley” Crushers.
Hey, look. They named their team after me.
So, we're all clear on the bet and the stakes?
Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I'm really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.
After you.
It's customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.
It's a custom, not a rule.
That's right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.
Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what's-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I'm gonna bowl now.
Leave me alone, Sheldon.
Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!
The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
Oh, that's me.
What are you talking about?
No!
Yes!
Penny, you're up.
No, let her go.
Tough luck, Sheldon.
Good. Keep thinking that.
Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!
What?
Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?
God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
Okay, here's the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
Really?
Right.
Everyone.
Great.
You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?
Mmm. How's Leonard doing?
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.
Yep.
Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over?
I don't have hot dogs.
Hey, where you been?
Yeah, he's over it, that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.
What?
Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry.
Okay.
I don't know. Why?
Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?
I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you?
Yeah, since when do you take walks?
Hold on. I'll walk down with you.
Or we could go together.

Okay.
You said you were going for a walk.
So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?
Which way are you going?
I parked my scooter down the block.
Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs?
I definitely smell raw hot dog.
All right, have a nice walk.
You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.


So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?
Well, good.
Oh, God, I feel terrible.
No. Why, do you?
Why did you ask if I had one, too?
All right. So, what's new in your life?
Have you been running?
I'm so glad you like it.
Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook.
Whatever. Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
Hey, where you been?
For an hour and a half?
How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
There are no solar flares right now.
Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.

Oh, just come in!
What do you want, Sheldon?
Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
What do you want?
Sheldon!
Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?
Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny.
Yes.
I guess not.
It's ten o'clock, where have you been?
How was I supposed to know that?
I know, I know.
No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.
Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?

What?
I'm sorry?
No.
I don't put pepper on salads.
Oh, come on. I don't want to sit by myself.
See you, buddy.
When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?
Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.
The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
Why didn't you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?
Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.
A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
So you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
When can I sit with you again?
Hey, Sheldon.
What? What are you doing with, what?
Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?
Oh. What?
Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You're having a woman stay with you?
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not flabbergasted. I'm puzzled. Yeah, let's go with puzzled.
Female jibber jabber?
Oh, they're not my friends.
She's here, she's here. How do I look? Do I look smart?
Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I'd written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn't confuse it with what I'd written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‘Cause if I tried to go there, I'd be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.
Nice to finally meet you in person.
Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?
Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I'd pick the yogurt.
I'm so glad you understand.
Well, I understand, too.
Oh, . I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you.
Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I'm smart.

Good to know.
What if there's a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?
Can I ask a question about your roommate?
What's his relationship status?
Okay.
How thoughtful.
You, too.

Morning, Sheldon.
Morning, Sheldon.
More than pleasant.
Okeydoke.
Something his mother taught him.
That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first.
Oh, good, you're up. Look, my car won't start. I need a ride to work.
No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.
Good.
Well, now…
I'm not recommending it. I'm saying it already happened.
Well…
Come on. It wasn't my fault.
Oh, no, no, it's okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.
I didn't betray Penny.
How am I betraying you?
Hi.
Thank you.
It's just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!
Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.
Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.
Hey.
Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.
I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn't have tried to change it.
Okay, I'm sorry.
So, we're good?
Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
You're not even watching!
Oh, so the dialogue offends you?
You're insane, you know that?!
What for? It's not going to rain.
That's a bazinga, right?
It's not like that, I'm watching someone's TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.
Relax, it's just a dirty sock.
Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.
Hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.
She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.
Hey.
Whoa! Is that the laser? It's bitchin'.
The moon.
Uh, that's a great question, Zack.
Sheldon! Play nice.
Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
What species is that?
No, just keep walking.
Tons. I've had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.
I'll help you.
Why? I mean, okay.
Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, 'cause it's gonna get loud.

What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?
Yeah, sorry about that.
Oh, God.
How many times have I asked you not to do that?
Where's Penny?
I wonder why she didn't say good-bye.
I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.
Really? Us gonna tell him?
Hi.
Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?
Four thirty.
What?
Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?
Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?
But it's true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
Well, come on, where's your scientific curiosity?
Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.
Okay, well, why don't you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.
All right, you can have a hot chocolate.
Why?
Sheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.
Are you willing to risk it?

You don't know we're wrong yet.
Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldon Cooper.
If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I'm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.
I don't object to the concept of a deity, but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.
And it only took 28 minutes.
Why?
I don't think that's going to happen, Sheldon.
Just wait.
Really? They're going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
Oh ha-ha, oh. That's amazing.
Hey, Sheldon?
Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
Sheldon has a girlfriend?
Four months.
Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what's new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?
Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.
Okay, well, what do you communicate about?
Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you're considering having a baby?
Okay, I have a question.
You don't even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?
Oh, God.
Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don't know, maybe actually spending some time with her.
Yeah.
Why not?
Okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.
Probably not.
You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.
What do you want?
Oh, that's great. Have fun.
What?
Well, go ask Leonard.
Leonard said cockamamie?
Okay, fine. When's the date?
Now?
Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?
Well, no, not per se, but…

You're welcome.
Can I ask you a question?
No.
Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things you should probably know.
My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.
But the light indicates…
Guys, how 'bout some music?
Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?
Well, why don't you tell her?
I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.
I don't know. I was just trying something.
Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?
That's an amusing factoid.
Is this true?
What? Where did you get 171 men?
Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.
14.
No.
Oh.
Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.
Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?

I did not have sex with 31 guys.
And that is?
You're still on that?
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I'm gonna tell your mother on you.
If I'd thought of that in the first place, I could've saved myself this whole night.
Hey, Howard, what's up?
Whatcha doin' there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
Yes.
Yes.
A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What's KBB?
How's that?
You can always get a badger and find out.
That long, huh?
What's there?
Tough break. You want eggs?
What's a dogapus?
Is somebody working on that?
Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
But it's Thursday. Thursday's pizza night.
Really? You're changing the Sheldonian calendar?
Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?
So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
Okay, here's my question. Didn't you already do that?
Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?
You're right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.

What the hell? What's the matter?
There's no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
Have you had your appendix out?
Let's get you to the hospital.
No.
Funny how things work out, isn't it?
Good night.
Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.
Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?
I don't have one.
Don't have one.
Uh, no.
No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.
It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.
All right, let's start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.
Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?
Okay, let's just warm up on the run.
Okay, let's go.
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Oh, let me help you up.
Sheldon, are you gonna join us?
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
I am looking at you.
You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.
At the hands of your roommate?
That's how I'm going to make it look.
Fine, but don't expect my help.
No, it's not.


In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?
Defend.
Correct. My turn.
Tuned bayonets.
Isn't it obvious?
What the hell are you guys playing?
We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don't know.
I can figure this out, let's see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I'll say cinnamon.
Is he always like this when he loses?
If I don't have to boom-boom.
Hello.
Okay.
Shamy?
Like everybody else's. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?
Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
I'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.
Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?
Got it.
Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm not sure she's the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.
Yeah, not my point.
Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.
So we already have you for all that.
No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.
Suffered in silence?
More like Yoko and Yoko.
Hey.
It's very impressive, for theoretical work.
Oooh!
I'm stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…
Yes, but if I'm successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.
We appear to have reached an impasse.
No, uh-uh.
Women, huh? Can't live with them, can't successfully refute their hypotheses.
Hey, Sheldon.
I hear you broke up with Amy.
Wow. That's like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?
Amy.
Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.
Okay. Good.
Don't try to change me, dude. I am what I am.
Hey. Aren't you going to introduce us to your little friend?
Hi.
Hey.  Oh, no.
So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
Zazzles?
Okay, we need to talk.
Cats, Sheldon. You're clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.
What?
Okay, yeah, fine.
Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you're feeling with this breakup.
Okay, I got it, I got it, she's not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
She didn't dump me. It was mutual!
Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.
Hold on to that thought.
Surprise.
My, my, that's a powerful smell.
Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.
Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.
Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it's creepy.
Shelly! Dinner's ready!
No cats!
Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.
Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.
Then stop talking.
Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.
Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly, I can't see it.
Excellent point.
Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it's a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn't have to end it for you.
I'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
Sixty-five.
I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
I would. I love cats. They're the epitome of indifference.

Next!
I'm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.
Oh, you're so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.
Has it occurred to you you're missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
What's up?
Hey.
You're being unreasonable. Why can't I have a desk?
You have a desk.
But I can't have one.
Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?
Oh, but there's money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?
Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?
Why?
Yes?
Sheldon.
And I can put it in your office?
Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
Ah, it's okay.
So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.
Yeah?
You said I could buy a desk.
Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?
Can you say it again for me?
One more time?
Now three times fast?
That's for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.
No.
No.
No.
I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.
Knock yourself out.
No.
No.
No. It's too Brobdingnagian.
Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I'd say it's spot-on.
Thank you.
Hey, Sheldon?
Sorry, dude, the thermostat's on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!
Oh, too bad! Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!
Oh, God, what's that smell? . Oh-ho-hoo!
What are you doing in there?
It's not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.
Didn't you say you're making hydrogen sulphide gas?
Isn't that flammable?
All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.
Thank you.
Right, right. So you're still just texting and emailing? You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?
Got it.
No, no. Maybe a little.
Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
Oh, right. That.
I'm not jealous.

Probably. What's your point?
Hmm, recently? Not much.
Um, shut up.
Sheldon, I'm just not dating someone right now. I don't need to go to a senior centre.
Fine. If I don't meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.
Hey.
Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard's got a girlfriend, Sheldon's got a girl…
…who's a friend.

No.
No.
I don't know. Maybe.
Thank you.
What the hell? How long has she been here?
That was two hours ago.
No.
No, I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.
That's not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.
That was rude.
Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.
Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.
Wait. I have a request.
I'd like you to meet my mother.
Certainly. Good night.
Yeah, what?
Yeah. So?
Well, you know how you're always saying that Amy is a girl who's your friend, and not your girlfriend?
You can't say that anymore.
Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.
Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?
That is insane.
Okay, good luck.
Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?
All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
There you go.
Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend. How do I look?
What are you working on?
Ah, you're going off the grid.
The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
What if she just comes over?
You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
Amy Farrah Fowler.
She's been here before.
What do you want to do?
Okay, where are you?
All right.


Sheldon?
I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.
In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she'll be satisfied that I'm in a relationship.
Precisely.
Don't be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
Sheldon, please, you're suffocating me.
It's nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn't believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.
What?
You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.
Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.
This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
Oh, Sheldon. You haven't changed a bit, have you?
Can you believe it? Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
Alright, this goes without saying, but I'm just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
Okay then.
Oh, not really, just hang out.
Train day?
I don't think we're going to do that.
Uh, my plans with Priya.
Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
I guess he just hates fun.
I don't know, I just have the one day.
Not particularly.
It's getting pretty late, how come you're still up?
That's pretty cool.
You've really got to get out more.
Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
If the past is any indication, no.
Drop axe.
Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.
Well then, bed mister.
Really? You're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
You don't want that, do you?
Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.
No, no, it doesn't matter, we'll be at work.
We're going to have to be very quiet.
No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I'll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?
Aha, you're funny.
What?
Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
Air freshener.
Uh, rash, that's a bad rash.
Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
Okay, he's in the bathroom, let's go.
Uh, cream.
Without.
Fine. With.
Use your best judgement.
Sounds great.
Good morning, Sheldon.
Making pretty good time, huh?
No.
Please don't tell anyone I spent the night with Raj's sister.
No-one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister.
Like what?
Priya and I are both adults. We didn't betray Raj.
What are you talking about?
Alright, and Raj.
You?
Okay fine, I'm, I'm a horrible human being, I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
My point is, Priya's gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.
Yes.
You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you'd keep that secret. Right?
Because, well, Batman has the secret.
Like what?
What.
Kind of busy here, Sheldon.
What do you want.
What alibi?
Oh, I'm so sure I'm going to regret this, but, who was I with?
Oh, God.
Leonard, call me if you're interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.
Top of the morning to you. You've reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.
Where did you get that?
An orang-u-tan?
C'mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she's attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
To, uh, Lucky Baldwin's.
Yes.
Look, I'm sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.
What were you doing with Priya?
Excuse me, I think how could you she's my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
Dude! I put that thing on my face!
And as long as we're talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard's food.
You put moths in my food?
Well, uh, I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush.
As long as we're apologising, Sheldon, I, I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.
I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
Yes.
Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?
These are pretty god, what flavour is this?
Papaya?
Guava?
I give up.
No, seriously, I think I've finally figured out my problem with women.
What does that have to do with me and women?
Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
Nobody cares. Do you know how long it's been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.
Want to get that?
Could you get that?
Would you please get that?
Dr. Cooper?
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.
Here's my I.D.
I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.
Thank you.
Fidelity, bravery, integrity?
Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.
Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?
That's really not the sort of thing we're interested in.
I did.
I'm afraid not. Is there anything else?
The Mars Rover?
You did.
Yes, well, let's talk about it anyway.
Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need.
To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it'd be Sheldon.
What are you doing up?
Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?
Did something happen today that's bothering you?
What?
Because you feel guilty?
Actually, you don't have insomnia. You're sleeping now.
You're having a guilt-ridden dream.
How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?

Was your statement untrue?
Then I'm afraid you can't withdraw it.
Is there anything else?
I'm sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.
It's closed.
This is Leonard Hofstadter?

I think he's eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.
But I actually didn't demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.

You?
And they were okay with that?
Are you kidding me? You've set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I'm sorry?
Your apology is not accepted.
Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I'm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.
Sheldon?
What are you doing here?
You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.
Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?
Could you be a little more specific?
I'm sorry, honey, I don't know millilitres.
Would you say that's about 40 milliliters?
Great.  Now, where were we?
Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.
All right. Sheldon, what's on your mind?
Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.
I drink.
You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there's nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.
Exactly. Sometimes you can't win.
Kirk cheated.
Right there with you.
What?

Hey.
Not really.
Oh. Go away, Sheldon.
What's in the bag?
You're giving me a couch cushion?
But you love that spot.
All right. Apology accepted.
I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there's no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to…
You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.
Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
Well, I'm watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?
Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.

Relax, it's five o'clock. The movie doesn't start till midnight.
You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.
Actually, I'm not. I'm using sarcasm to mock you.
Don't worry, Sheldon. We'll be fine.
Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn't wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.
Excellent.
Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.
Hysterical!
All right. I'll have to go shopping.
Who‘s there?
Hugh who?

Ooh. Can't wait for that to start.
Eight for 28.
Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.
Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats.
Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.
It's fine, it's fine. Go back to sleep.
Hey, look who's here! Hey, buddies!
Mee-sa think that very funny.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.
Calm down, Sheldon.
Oh, oh, uh, looks like they're getting ready to let people in.
Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it's only going to upset you.

Guys, I am sorry. We are full up.
Sorry. Fire regulations. Should've gotten here earlier.
I guess that's that. Let's go home.
We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.
Where did he go?  We're looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.
What is that?
Sheldon, this is crazy.
Listen to me. You are over-tired. You're not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
Oh, look who they let in.

He's got the movie! Get him!
He's not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?

Oh, okay. Good. I don't need more comics. Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.
You'll never guess what just happened.
No.
Penny kissed me.
Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
Yeah, sure.
Love you, too.
Maybe.
Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
No, you're right. No, there's, there's no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?
Fines?

Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.
Why? You writing a book?
Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
Hey.

It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.
Great.
Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?
We're good.
We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.

It's too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it's fine.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.
No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I'm checking my vital signs every hour.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.
Ears and genitalia.
I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny's friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.
Zack.
Zack.
Hoo.
Why do you keep saying Zack?
I'm not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.
There was no question. I simply said hoo.
My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.
Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.
I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny's friend Zack.
Let's look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.
Religion?
No.
Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
What are you doing?
Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
And?
You reject it because you don't feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?
That's not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.

That's thinking ahead.
So how's Amy?
Oh, no. Why?
Just going to skip over that insult.
Oh! Okay. Wow.
Are you sure?
I'm suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy's urges?
Yeah. That's not what I had in mind.
Exactly.


I'm sure it'll wash off.
It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.
Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.

As am I.
Lesser Warlord of Ka'a.
Infinite Sheldon?
Do you understand why people don't want to play with you?
You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it'll just come back to life.
Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.
Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I'm stupid.
What would I even say?
A Milk Dud?
Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.

Come on, that's what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.
I don't know, it still wasn't very nice.
Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we're cool.
Really? I haven't been to a comic book store in literally a million years.
Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?
So are you guys coming to my New Year's Eve costume party?
Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard's mother in high-heeled boots?
You can't replace me with Zack.
Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.
We're going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year's Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.
Okay, what about your friend Amy?
What are you doing?
You're jogging.
I'm Batman.
All right. Let's get this thing over with.
Then who are you talking to? Babe?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?
Really?
No. Wait, wait, does it?
Good-bye, Sheldon.
I don't know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?
Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.
Ooh, I call Kermit.
Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?
Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.
Yes.
And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!
Ten, nine, eight…
Seven, six…
Five, four, three…
Two, one! Happy New Year!
What should we do?
That's a Hanukkah present you're regretting, huh?
I had a great idea. You know how we're always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you're doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?
You know what's a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
Yeah.
I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
What?
Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…
We're gonna write an application…
Okay, stop, stop!
Satisfied?
Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.
Hang on. Let's see where he's going.
That is ridiculous.
There's your answer, free food.
Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.
Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
Sheldon, you're not in charge. It's my idea. I'm in charge.
Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
Ooh. Leonard's going all alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass.
Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.
What?
It's not a joke. It's the real design.
Sheldon, I think this will work. Let's just try it my way.
Are you done?
So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…
So it spells Sheldon?
Like I was saying, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
No.
That's just Sheldon backwards.
We're not wasting time with names right now.
No.
Again, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
Oh Sheldon, stop it.
That's enough, Sheldon.
Okay, that's it, you're fired.
Because you're impossible to work with.
What are you doing?
But I fired you.
No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
I don't want it better. I want it my way.
What the hell are bus pants?
Look, I'm still happy to drive you to work. Nothing's changed in that regard. We're still roommates, we're still friends.
It means after we play handball, I'm showering at home.
World's Greatest Astrophysicist?
Howard Wolowitz. Why not World's Greatest Engineer?
We're not quitting on Leonard.
What are you talking about?
No. The moment has passed.
You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?
We're actually scanning equations and getting good results.
What are you doing?!
No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?
Sheldon! We're working here!
No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.
Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.


What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
Oh.
Something got you down, there, Sheldon?
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Is that so?
Aw.
Hey, you don't need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.
Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.
Well, you don't like it?
Why not?
And Leonard didn't want to work with you? Imagine that.
Sheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?
Milk.
That's what it says on the packet.
No, sorry.
What does that mean?
Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.
That's right.
No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody's suffered enough. The thing is, you're going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
Say you're sorry.
Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you're always trying to learn about sarcasm?
No?
Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you're sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.
Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let's go.
Oh, you're welcome.
Okay, now that you're back on the team, let's get you caught up.
Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.
Thanks.
We have.
Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.
Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.
Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don't they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel's. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they're so cute…
Hey. So you guys ready to order?
Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry, I'm actually pretty busy this weekend.
Boy, this is great. I haven't had a vacation in ages.
That does seem to be a valid principle.
I don't believe there's any such thing.
Don't worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.
Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.
Yay!

Fine.  Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
Still right behind you.
No, we discussed it. We decided we didn't want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.
Are you an element in the actinoid series?
Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
Are you in the lanthanoid series?
Uh, I don't know. Are you food?
Well, it's a table, right? I mean, why can't there be food on it?
Who elected you Road Trip God?
It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It's not technically Road Trip God, it's Travel Supervisor.
Good night.
We are not having coitus.
Why?

We weren't getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
Yeah, hi.
Let me ask you something, Bernie.
I'd like to weigh in here. No.


Because we're going 120 miles per hour.

Yeah.
Really? Triumphant?
I don't know, I kind of promised Howard.
Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.
Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.
So, what do you think?
Not even when I do this?
Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.
If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.
Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.
All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?
Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.
Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.

What?
I'm not an actress. I'm an actress.
You want an acting lesson?
Okay, where is this coming from?
Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.
Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.
I think it's the only way to look at it.
Probably. I'm just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
Forget it.

What's wrong?
You were acting?
Well, good for you. Come on in.
Well, I thought we'd start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.
So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?
Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.
All right, let's just say we've warmed up.
Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don't we try some improvisation?
This is all about listening and responding.
I'm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.
All right.
Okay, it's not a movie. It's improv. So no one calls action.
Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?
Yogurt?
Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.
Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.
Okay, you know what? Let's just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.
You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?
So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?
Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.
Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
And you think it's better than Tennessee Williams?
Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
KMN.
Okay, that's fine, but let's try and get you out of your comfort zone.
Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.
It's only logical.
All right.
Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.
Now just read your mother's line.
Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.
Just keep going!
We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.
Okay, okay, let's try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.
Well, you're losing your son.
All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you're sad to see him go. I'm gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That's your cue.
All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.
Okay, I guess we're improvising now.
Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.
You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can't see themselves in the mirror?
Why's the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
Hey, there's my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?
Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.
I'm in!
Just a little fund-raiser for the university.
I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.
So, Saturday night! It's gonna be off the hook.
What about Sheldon?
Really? What do we tell Siebert?
Sheldon, it's Saturday night, you'll be doing laundry.

Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you've made a foolish mistake.
Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.
Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.
And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.
Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year's donations might go to, say, the geology department.
Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.
Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.
Oh, I don't know, it's one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun.

Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don't, I, I really don't know why. Tonight? Sure, that'd be great. Okay, I'll, I'll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
Well, wherever we're going, she's sending a car to pick me up.
What?
Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I've been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.
Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.
What?
Well, n-no, hold on a second, I'm not going to sleep with her.
Well, forget it! It's not gonna happen.
What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?

I won't be too late. I'm just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
What's this?
I am not going to have sex with her.
Are you insane? I'm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
Good night, Sheldon.
He still won't shag the old lady, huh?
Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you're missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.
Oh, nothing's going on. Excuse me.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
No, I didn't do it for the money.
No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.
Uh, I'm gonna go lie down.
Hey!
No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.
Howard's gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
No.
Tea does sound nice.
Wait, wait. What?
Yeah, that's a real pickle. Bye.
That's not really necessary.
Thanks.

That's very nice of you, but I made other plans.
Hey.
Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don't get to tell me who I can and can't have a relationship with.
Oh, yeah, you, too.
Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.
Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company. I don't want to impose.
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.
I didn't do the audition.
I smell Chinese food.
Are Leonard and Priya here?
Oh. Where's Raj?
How about Howard?
Oh, okay. Well, I guess it's just the two of us, huh?
Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.
Oh, sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.

Okay, I'm out of here.
I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's. I think Howard's going to be there. You want to join us?
Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight?
Just come with me to Raj's.
It's not a party. It's the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.
How come it's not a party when we do it here?
I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon. I'm going to see Priya. Everyone's over there. You coming or not?
I guess you're right. See you later.
Come with me to Raj's and eat there.
I really doubt that's what he'll serve.
What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?
What?
So don't watch TV. Read a book.
Right.
Oh, sounds great.
That's got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister's mouth?
There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.
Just sit here.
Okay, we've got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.
Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?
Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?
Where are all your friends?
Okay.
Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What's troubling you, buddy?
Oh, the horror.
Ugh!
Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj's, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.
Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?
Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
Sheldon, look at me. I think it's time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.
What you doing?
You do realize everyone's eating at Raj's again tonight?
You're having people over?
Really? LeVar Burton's coming here?
Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.
Of course. Good night.
Okay.
It certainly is.
I am leaving.
Good-bye, Sheldon.

Um. Hi. I'm Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I'm currently living in. And I guess what I'm hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.
I'm Zack, and I'm, uh… uh… could you come back to me?
I'm Barry Kwipke, and I'm here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?
One more question…
Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There's no one around, so naturally, I'm free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.
What's the difference?
Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?
Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice…
No.
Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.
Does yours have wet bweasts in it?
So, long story short, I nailed her.
No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don't know why. Just do.
Check.
Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?
Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
Come on in.
Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.
Would you like some homemade chili?
Yes.
Sheldon, do you want some or not?
Cheers.
Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I've been working on?
Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.
Yes, it is. Very cool!
A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.
Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
Oh, really? So how did I do it?
I thought you had more important things to think about.
Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
Oopsy.
Fine. Get another deck and I'll do the trick with that.
Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?
Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.
Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature's way?
What?
I am not opening that door, Sheldon.
Yep.
Nope.
No.
Whatcha doin'?
What's up with the infrared cameras?
Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?
Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.
Okay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.

Really?
Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
Okay.
What's with the wand and the beep?
These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It's transmitting to your phone.
Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!
Hey!
Why so glum, chum?
Oh, that's too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?
Want me to tell you how to do it?
I'll show you one more time. Raj?
All right. . Two of hearts.

Oh, my God, what did they get?
You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
Into the bag.
Oh, no, not Glenn?
Thank you, officer.
Mr. Cooper, there's nothing…
Fine. Dr. Cooper. I'm sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.
What?
Thank you, officer.
I'm really sorry, Sheldon.
I don't know.
I'm on it.  Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.

Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn't leave a digital fingerprint.
Hold on. I'm talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he'll help us track down your things.
Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.
Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!
Just say thank you.
So, how do you guys want to play this?
Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.
Good, good. I'll tell you what happens.
Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.
Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.
Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.
Yes, he does live with his parents. Here's a Google Earth shot of their house.
Hold on, you're thinking of going there?
Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?
No one's getting tortured.
I totally had one of those.
I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?
And me.

Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?
Yeah, we're coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.
I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.
Next time we go to kick someone's ass, we take the train.
Sheldon, let's go.
Why did you bring that?
Okay, let's get clear on something. We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one's bat'lething anybody.
No.
Come on.
Who is it?
Don't say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
Uh, Sheldon?
Yeah. Who are you?
I don't think so. Let me see that.
I know. I've always wanted one.

Something's wrong, I'm not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?
Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
Well, we'd better call somebody to come pick us up.

So did you at least get Sheldon's fake stuff back?
How come?
Okay.
My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there's a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader.
I'm glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it's nice to goof off and do something silly.
You can think about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can't order the corresponding dish in column B. That's sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.
What if he's right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?
Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
Yes?
Yes, in part.
Excuse me?
Nice shot.
Perfect.
Shooting at a target?
An arrow.
I'm not going to do that, Sheldon.
Really? How could you tell?
You don't say?
So, what's the gossip?
Fine, don't tell me.
Oh. That's too bad. I wonder what happened.

Oh, yeah? What about it?
Lucky bastard.
I know. It'll be awful.
Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India's a goofy place.
Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it's not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
By all means.
I don't understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
It's not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?
Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
I should think so. That's gold.
Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
Then we'll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.
Hey.
Hope you're hungry.
Good, good. Everything okay between you two?
No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.
No. That's not what he meant.
Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
No. Happy accident.
I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
Pun intended?
Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.
I wonder what changed her mind.

I can't hear you, I'm in the shower.
What?
I can't hear you, I'm in the shower.
What kind of emergency?
You might not want to do that.
Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.
Hello, Sheldon.
We were in here first, you can't be in here.
According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.
What?

Proceed.
Can I see the roommate agreement?
All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn't look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.
Oh, I'm afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.
Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?
Superceded!
I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy's Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi's pizza night.
A good question, Howard. Turns out you can't. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?
Opa!
Not as much as you.
I got you the lamb kabob.

Hey. What's up?
Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I'm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you're welcome to tag along.
Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
You smell like baby powder.
Oh, I'm not confused at all. You're like a sexy toddler.
Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?
I'm available for experimentation.
Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie .
Really?
Did you take dance lessons?
Oh, we are so taking you dancing.
Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?
Where you can what?
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
How come if we're the smart people, we don't do this every night?
My burps taste like cranberry juice.
Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
I have yoo-hoo.
Make yourself comfortable.
Oh, that's just Ricky.
Don't be silly. He's one of the animals in my department's nicotine addiction study.
I'm giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
Yeah. He's kind of an ass.
Of course. What's rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
And you want me to kill her? Done.
I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us 'cause people love monkeys.
Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
You're being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.
I hope you don't take what I'm about to do as a comment on what we just did.
Morning, Sheldon.
Why would I want to do that?
Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?
So what happens when it counts down?
Yeah, of course, just not today.
Please, don't push this.
No, he's bluffing.
It's blackmail!
This is ridiculous.
Give him what he wants or we're done.
Really?
Self-destruct sequence aborted.

It most assuredly is not.
Yes. I also found a Korean man's business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?
Sheldon?
Okay. Don't really know where we go from here.
Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!
Okay, see you later.
That is good news. Bye.
That, that's brilliant.
Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?
All right.
Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.
And what?
Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.
Got it. Bye.

I need a hug.
Come on, Sheldon, open the door.
I don't want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.
Well, not so much depressed as lonely.
What?
Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.
What are you doing?
Oh, cool. Can I play?
No.
No, thank you. I'm fine.
I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering what's got me down.
I'm going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.
Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared.
A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing. He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
I'm not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
That's not the point.
I'm a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.
Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You're a good friend.
Hi.
We're scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.
You're cute.
Oh, I'm sorry, we're out. We have muffins.
I…

Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.
Uh, that's my water.
My water. You're drinking it.
Yes. It's my water.
Here we go.
You guys ready to order?
He drank from Leonard's glass.
That's actually my napkin.
Where are you going?
Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.
You all right?

Oh, yeah, she's got puddles in all the right places.
Sorry. Walking tree.
Sheldon, that's my water.
I know.
Hey.
Haven't seen you in a while. How's it going?
I don't know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.
My mirth. Classic.
It's not a big deal, Sheldon. It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister, I've had to keep my distance. I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.
What are you doing at work these days?
Alright, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.
Sheldon, let's go!
Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we're going.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.
Right, fine. I'll tell Howard you didn't come because you're more concerned about your own well-being than his.
Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it's time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.
What's the difference?
Thanks for clearing that up.
Okay, you're not helping.
Go sit over there.
Bernie, wait!
It's the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.
What's wrong with the bathroom here?
Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. I'm not taking you home.
No!

It's like he's trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don't doze off. You will never hear the end of it.

I got a colossal serpent right here.
Sorry, I'm just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon's new Facebook photo.
Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon.
Kill me.
Guys, sorry I'm late. I have amazing news.
Oh!
So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing that when you two get married, you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?

It's indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.
I'll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?
Have you considered massage?
I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.
Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.
You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
Don't flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
Can I sleep here tonight?
Leonard's having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.
Well, he's in my bed. Why can't I be in his?
Come on, dude, I'm exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.
Good night, Sheldon.
You're kidding.
Until you have kids.
When did you take my blood?
What the hell is this?
This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
Well, that seems fair.
Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.
Sheldon, dinner!
This is the difference between eating and dining.
Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?
Thanks. Wow! What's with the fancy spread?
What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
He's living at my place, so I'm living here.
Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That's big.
Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.
Hit me.
Monkeys.
When a suitcase just won't do.
To friendship.

What?
I live here.
Priya's going back to India.
I've been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
She gave me a beautiful watch.
Yes.
Oh. It's, it's not what it looks like.

What are you grinding about?
Just let it go, Sheldon.
They slept together, Sherlock.
She lied.
Hey.
No, I'm fine with it.
What?
That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.
Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.
I don't want to talk to Amy.
You called my mother?

I don't see anything.
Sure, whatever.
Sorry, Sheldon, it's just not a good time for playing games.
Yes, no and no.
What are you doing?
Let's get 'em!
Here, here.
Shh! It's my agent, it's my agent. You're kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it! Really? Oh, I'm so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.
Oh, hell with Nebraska. I'm gonna be a star!

Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.
Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.
That doesn't sound like mocking.
I don't know. Why?
Listen, I don't want to be rude, but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so…
Yes, I've always admired that about you.
Oh, good.
A hobby?
You know, some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance. They'd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
Of course I like Amy.
Oh, I miss you, too.

Oh, it's no problem. It's actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We're like an old married couple.
I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
I want a divorce.
It's great, isn't it?
What name?
Oh, all right, well, I'm glad you like it. I mean, I still can't get over the fact someone just threw it away.
Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.
What is wrong?
Sheldon, take it easy.
I went into this marriage with so much hope.
Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.
I don't want to talk about it. You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.
Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you'd started growing again.
Yello.
Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.
Yeah. It's cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
Why don't you give it a try, Sheldon?
Why don't you just admit you overreacted?
It's like living with a Chihuahua.
What's up, buttercup?
Nope.
What's the word, hummingbird?
What's the gist, physicist?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Oh! I didn't even think of that. Thanks.
Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…
Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.
Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff'rent Strokes? Now the world don't move to the beat…
Well, that's every song I know. What's up?
Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.
For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?
Yes, I am.
Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn't mean I have to participate.
Kiss me where I've never been kissed before.
Never mind. I'll talk to Penny.
Ooh, me.
Thank you all for this high honour.
All right, I got to go to work. I'll walk down with you.
Neither of them are close.
Okay, I'm not driving him.
What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?
Which side do you come down on?
Hang on. You seriously think I'm going to live with your mother?
Mmmmmm.
Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.
Rough night, Casey Jones?
I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.
Doesn't matter. You're out, he's in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.

Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.

Sounds like you had a great night.
Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin's a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?
What?

I say, hey Ma, what's for dinner?”
Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
Really? So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn't that a little on the nose?
That's cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
I don't know if I want to play anymore.
Are we ready to order?
With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
So, what's for dinner?
Uh, no, that's not it. Just come with me, please.
Do you really want that?
What's it thinking about now?
Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.
Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.
Why are you still doing this?
You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.
Wow, can't believe he has a girlfriend.
Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.
Could you tell us?
Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
What do you mean, vastly wealthy?
Look, I know they have money. I don't think it's that much.
Well, so how much is that?
He's not going to listen, he's in love.
Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
Yeah, real big of you.
It's from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
What did you have in mind?
It would be a replica of a movie prop.
Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?
Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.
Yeah. It's okay, I guess.
Are you kidding? I'm already giving you the friends and family discount.
Slow down. Two hundred.
Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.
Man, you're killing me!
Two ten, and I'm losing money.
See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
Ah, hey, Wil.
Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
No.
Good deal.
All right, great. Later.
I was actually thinking about going.
Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
Can you or can't you?
It never is, is it?
Got it. Can I have my water?
Wait, what is going on?
It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.
Who's Mohammed Lee?
Cheers.
Thank you.
Pretty cool about Howard, huh?
For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.
Sheldon, I know you're a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?
Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.
A floppy disk?
Oh! Oh, God!
I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.
Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.
I'm going to a party. I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
All right, Sheldon, we're going to Wil's. This is your last chance.
Hey, Sheldon?
No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.
Yes.
Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.
I'm going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.
What are you doing here?
Hey, Sheldon, I'm so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.
This is for you.
Look at what I wrote.
It's my last one. I want you to have it.
Oh, wow. I haven't seen one of these in years.  Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?
Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?
Don't worry. It doesn't take up a whole lot of your time.
It's called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you'd come with me, Sheldon.
Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire 'em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord's forgiveness.
For example, if Shelly was aboard, he'd write “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!
Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn't want to cook.
Actually, I wouldn't mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.
I've never had it, but there's no harm in trying something new.
Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he's fine.
Irasshaimase!
What's the last thing you were ever happy about?
So, Shelly, what's up with you and your friend Amy, if you don't mind a mother prying a bit?
Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can't force things. You need to figure out if you're in a relationship or if you're just calling it one. It's like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don't make 'em biscuits.
It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?
Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.
I'm so lonely.
Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'. What do we do when someone's hurtin'?
And when they're drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?
I didn't get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.
You want some Oreos?
No, regular.

Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.
Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming.
Well, it's super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.
Oh, not crazy at all. And don't beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.
Nope. She says if I don't back out she's going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.
I don't know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.
What do you say?
Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we're not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.
Apology accepted.
I am still going out with your friends.
You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.
I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.
Sorry. Syrup.

Are you getting sick?
Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn't making you a priority?
Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
Sheldon, we're all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you're just like everybody else.
Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better.  Sure you're not coming down with a cold?

You take notes, darlin'. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He'll die at 50 but his love will be true.
Here.
Sweetheart, are you sick?
Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We've got to get you to bed.
Don't worry. Mama's here to take care of her baby.
Of course.
Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn't have hair on your chest.
And whose fault was that?
Shelly, you're not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.
Sweetheart, you are a grown man.
Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.
Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?
Well, that was rude.
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty…

Sheldon, Sheldon.
You should've seen your face.
Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.
We can't beat him. He's just too smart.
Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!
That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.

How many times are you gonna tell me? What's with you?
Will you relax? I'll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?

Good morning, Sheldon.
You have a thing of paper clips right there.
I don't know. Maybe.
All right.  Who do we have here?
Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?
Let's go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.

What are you doing?
Hey, well, see you. I'm going out.
Yeah, me, too. I can't make up my mind.
No. I'm having a moral crisis.
Oh, what the hell. I'm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don't know if I should, because I'm going out with Priya, but she's in India.
Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn't do more than the stuff that you did, and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.
That actually does help.
Screw it, I'm going.
Do you mind? I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
No.
Who is it?
That's not my mom, it's Bernadette.
Hi, Sheldon.
What's up?
Well, I, I'm gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don't you think it could have waited until then?
Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?
Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
This is adrenaline, we're gonna have to inject it into his heart.
You are. I'm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we've only got one shot.
Hurry! We're running out of time!
Just do it!
Trick or treat, bubbeleh.
Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I'm, I'm sorry, I have to go. I don't believe this.
Uh, I was hoping you wouldn't notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.
What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?
Who didn't? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?
Wait for moi.
Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.
Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Please, we're eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?
This time, it's your fault.
Leonard's coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren't too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you're up.
Come on, it's your turn. We said we'd get more fresh air.
Did you try calling her on the telephone?
If you're worried, we can go over there and see if she's all right.
I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
You do?
Forget about the bobcat.
Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.
Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Bye.
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
I wanted to be alone.
Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.
Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
Yes.
It's just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.
Sheldon, I'm going to ask you something, and I'd like you to keep an open mind.
At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.
Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.
We cuddle. Final offer.
This is not a safe place. You can't share anything here.
What?
What do you want us to do about it?
Why do I have to talk to Penny? She's not my girlfriend.

What's going on?
Really? Amy?
Cuddles?
Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?
Sounds like most of my dates.
Well, he's smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster.
What the hell is going on?
Really? On top of everything else, you're afraid of birds?
Great. I'll see you later. And remember, he's more afraid of you than you are of him.
Sheldon, just ignore him.
The bird's still there?
I don't know. Scree-scree.
Sorry. Do you think I'm overdressed?
I'm going to the movies with Penny. I don't want her to think that I think it's a date.
No, but she might think I think it's a date even though I don't.
Are we overthinking this?
You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.
Too casual?
I'm pushing play.
If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.
I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.
Hummingbirds are pretty.
Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.
All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.

Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.
Come back in, Sheldon, he's not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone's pet.
Oh, he's a sweetie.
Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.
Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don't be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!

Oh, it's just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.
I still think he looks like someone's pet. Maybe we should put up posters.
If you're keeping him, I've got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.
Hey, can I talk to you about something? It's a little awkward.
Yeah, that's not it. Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.
No. He wanted me to find out if you'd have a problem with him asking her out.
You know what? Never mind. I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out.
All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you'd feel about it.

Out.
I don't know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.
You okay?
We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.
Incredibly so.
Incredibly so.
Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon's patented blend of condescension and no sex isn't enough to hold on to a woman?
Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?
I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore.
You're so full of it.
Sheldon, why don't you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don't want her going out with other men?
Here's a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.
That's all of us. Can I use the laptop?
Who do we love?
Who do we love?
Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.
What's up?
I'm sorry, what?
God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?
Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I'm going with this?
Mm.
You're not the guy.
I call everyone sweetie.
Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.
Don't patronize me.
Hi, Sheldon.
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Um, again…
Anything else?
I'm listening.
Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.
Yes.
Oh, you're welcome.
Good night.
How did you get into my apartment?
What's that?
It's so romantic.
Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive.
We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
That's my boyfriend. It's open!
What do you want me to do about it?
Okay. If you can't get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?
Sure.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.
There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He's in town and wants to have drinks.
Basketball Pope.
I don't know.
No, that was a different guy.
No, that was a different, different guy.
No.
I don't know.
It's two a.m. What are you doing up?
Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
Thanks.
I didn't have clams.
It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.
You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I'm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I'm hitting myself.”
Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you're a big-time scientist now.
Yeah, congratulations.
From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.
Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.
Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.
Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You're like the smartest guy I've ever known.
Sheldon, I got this.
Sheldon.
I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
What is that?
Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
It wasn't fun for me.
That was pretty badass, dude.
Here's your cocoa.
Yes.
Yes.
You got one for good luck.  I'll get it.
No.
Sheldon, we can't let him drive.
Not really, no. It's funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we're reversed. You're the winner.
What's that?

Yeah.
What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
Morning, Jimmy.
I might kill him right now.
No, you're done. I want you out of my apartment right now.
Or what?

I'm telling you, dude, there's a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.
How is this lying?
Can't you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?
Don't be so hard on him. It's natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
How is that not amusing?
Ooh, look who's out on a date. Pasadena's favourite power couple, Shamy.
That is so hot.
How was your day?
Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.
That's nice. Anyway, I've been dreaming of this day for a long time.
Sheldon, I'm the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.
Give me a minute. I'm gonna go wash up.
Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
Honey, she's upset. You're her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she's excited by.
Well, just smile and think about koalas.
Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?
How come you're not doing a mission? You're just wandering around.
You want to talk about it?
You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What's going on?
Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
No, I can't. I'm playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I'm no expert in women.
That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.
Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
I don't know what to tell you. Buy her something.
Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
Glad I could help.

Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.
Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.
Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?
Trust me, we are not a couple.
Fine, go ahead.
Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.
Actually, that's only 750. Everything's on sale.

I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?
Sheldon, you're up.
We both know that's your koala face.
Of course I do, I'm a princess, and this is my tiara!
You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?
Okay, let's talk about that.
We all do. Now, how about dinner?
Excuse me.
Ooh!

I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that's defilement.
Oh, boy, do I?
No.
Where on earth did you get that from?
That doesn't make it true.
Because she's great in everything.

I guess it didn't go well.
How about now?
You were in the middle of an erection.

Yeah, hi, hi. How's it going?
Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?
Yeah, well, so was I.
Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.
The, the gas station across the street.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.
What?
What?
No.
I don't want beef jerky.
Fine.

Why?
Me, too. Out of deference to them, let's not flaunt our happy relationship.
We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
Is the point that you don't know when to let something go?
Oh, that is not true.
Well…
What? Yeah.
I don't know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.
Yes, and I think we should go anyway.

Hang on, Dr. C. What's vexillology?
Cool. I think I just learned something.
I'll say.
Sweet!
I'm surrendering to fun.
Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.
You okay?
Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What's vexillology?
It's Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I'm back.

I will take that action.
Oh, yeah.
For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.
Even Doctor Who.
What's baffling me is what you could've possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
You are most certainly welcome, sexy.
I'm sorry?
I haven't bonded with it.
Cooper.
Good night, you.
Und ich bin eine pretzel!
Mit…
Aaargh. What the hell?
Oh, no, come on!
I have to get a lock for my door.
Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.
Fine.
Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.
I don't know, what am I doing?
Aah!
How'd you do?
You know what, I'm so tired I can't even think straight. I'm going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?
Oh, can't you take the bus to the dentist?
They put you under for a cleaning?
Whatever, Sheldon. I'm exhausted. I'm not taking you to the dentist.
You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It's ridiculous. I'm your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.
I don't know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.
Where do I sign?
There. Done.
I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
‘Sup?
I saved you a dumpling.
I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy. I'm right in the middle of my addiction study. I've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow's the day we switch them to O'Doul's.
Absolutely. But when Ma's hips give out, you're up, kid.
Their meatballs are pretty good.

Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?
Ninth?
Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.
Yeah.
Yes.
No.
I'm sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?
Sheldon, I'm working. I can't take you to the dentist. Also, and I can't stress this enough, I don't want to take you to the dentist.
‘Sup?
Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?
All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.
Ooh, Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.
Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.
What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
It's just a blackout, I'm sure the power will be back on soon.
You know, I got some candles in my apartment.
You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let's go.
Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there's nothing else to do right now.
Since when don't you knock? It's like the only good thing about you.
Fine, what is it?
S'mores, huh? Good for you.
No, thanks. I'm good.
I thought you said candles were dangerous.
Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don't see why we can't be friends. And I'm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don't want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.
That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.
You say thank you.
It's not crazy.
I kind of like the sound of that.
So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day?
Can I sit in your spot?
Can I control the thermostat?
Do I get a card?
Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?
Leonard's Day?

Five.
E.
Gamma.
Upsilon?
Positive.
I haven't seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
It's not funny. That mistake got published.
Told ya.
No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.
Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you're refusing to take your vacation.
You're obligated to take one. And I'd also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I'll see you all on Monday, except for you.
Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.
That tonight's gonna be a good night, and tonight's gonna be a good night, and tonight's gonna be a good, good night! Tonight's the night, uh, uh, let's live it up, uh, I got my money, let's spend it up…
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing hiding back there?
What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I'll drive you there.
Fine.
Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?
How about Florida? They've got Cape Canaveral, they've got Disney, they've got my Aunt Ida and the world's largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.
Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.
Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.
Isn't that just Feynman's idea?

I'm excited to work with my boyfriend. It's gonna be romantic.
Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that's the love story Disney should tell.
Oh, I'm gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.
No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.
Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.

Soap spots. Wash 'em again.
Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it's, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.
All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.
I'm sure it was.
Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.
How's it going?
Great.
Really? Is that what you think?
Hey, I've been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You've been here for three hours, and you've spent one of them in the bathroom.
Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right.
Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
Okay, smart guy. I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.
You're getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It's the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you.
Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
No. But your thumb does.
What are you doing here?
What happened to your thumb?
What can I get you?
You and Amy? Good?
All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.

What do you want?
Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
That's not an apology.
I want a real apology.
No.
No.
Sheldon.
You're forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They're still dirty from yesterday.
I wonder how long Sheldon's got.
Yeah.
So sad.
What's up, fewwas?
Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.
Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.
You just called dibs.

Can't this wait?
Can't you take this up with your department chairman?
Gentlemen, there's a task I'm trying to accomplish here, and I'm having trouble doing it.
Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I'm sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.
Well, as wong as we're here, I might as well take a weak.
Yes?
Ooh, limited edition. Nice.
What's he doing here?
Cooper.
Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don't want tea. Wet's get down to bwass tacks.
We're not fwiends.
How about I take Wothman's office, and you go suck a wemon?
What the fwig is that?
How does it work?
I'm sowwy. Can you wepeat that?
Almost got it. One more time.
Sheldon, stop. He's screwing with you.
H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?
All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?
Balls in the basket.
No. No, I'm not.
All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It's no longer funny. Let's try something else.
Oh, you are going down, Cooper.
Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.

I'm happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.
Thank you.
Oh. Hello.
What are you doing?
Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?
Why is there a hole here?
Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That's nice.
What, you don't like wind chimes?
The bird?
So?
The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
Sheldon, relax.
If you're not happy, why don't you just let Kripke have the office?

What happened?
Why would you do that?
I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I'll pick you up when you're done.
Hey, Sheldon.
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's in the hospital. He's pretty sick.
I can cut it for you.
Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it. He's a barber.
What are you talking about?
There's no such thing as haircut records.
Have you ever seen them?
Your what?
Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.
So my kid said the funniest thing today.

Sure. What are you doing?
So, what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?
You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair. I could do it for you.
Sheldon, be nice.
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted… I'm wanted… wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you're ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.
Well, this isn't a crisis. Why don't you just let your hair grow out a little?

Can I help you?
Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?
I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!
Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that's, that-that's what chess is all about.
Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.
Uh, sweetie, are you all right?
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Oh, uh, he's crazy.
You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again. We don't know what's gonna happen.
I think this could be good for you. Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit.
Great. What are you going to do first?
Don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
Sheldon, it's three o'clock in the morning.
I was sleeping.
No, he doesn't.
Why did you get bongos?
Oh, Leonard, it's three o'clock in the morning. I don't care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.
Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.
W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.
No, it was called for.
All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.
It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I'm doing. Please let me cut your hair.
There's not a hair on my body I wouldn't let this woman trim.
What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
Almost done.
Well, sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.
Okay, what do you think?
Ha, told you. Okay, I'm just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.
Woo-hoo!
We are going to play the online game.
Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party.
She'll be disappointed if we don't show up.
No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it's none.
You use it to get your way.
We'll miss you, Sheldon.

Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?
Uh, I don't know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.
Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.
I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it. That's all I got.
I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn't help.
Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation.
Uh-uh.
Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
Gummy bears? Thank you.
Not a chance.
All right, sweetie, I'm not going to get involved in your relationship.
Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
What's that?
Good morning.
I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt's nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It's like a vacation for your teeth.
You sure you're okay with this?
Thank you. That means a lot to me.
Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you're going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn't that a little rude?
You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I've already told everybody I'll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.
Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.
Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
Fine, I'll change.
I can't help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
And if you don't start treating me better, I'm leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.
Oh.
Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let's go.
Oh my God, I love this chicken.
Okay, you're right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.
Well, can you make it soon. There's a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette's mom, and the other three, mine.
Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster's wedding.
I'm not telling. I'm from Asia. I'm mysterious. Deal with it.
No, uh, I don't think so.

Yeah, I'm glad.
Well, I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke the other night about me eating all your food.
I'm sorry, you are our resident cut-up?
Prove it.
Who's there?
Interrupting physi…
Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!
Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.
Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?
Awesome!
Ah!
Why, they're just toys?
Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?
Down here, on your desk.
I need to speak with you.
It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.
I'm not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.
Yes, and to open it would destroy it's value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.
Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?
Therefore? To not play with it would be?
Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.

Hello again, Sheldon.
I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard's. You should be ashamed of yourself.
If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?
Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.
Well I am unhappy.
I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.
Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.

What?
I dunno. I just think it's a waste.  Relax. I'm just looking at the box.
What is your problem?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Why would you open mine?
Well, you should talk to Stuart.
What is the truth?
Mmm.
So, is that one mine.
Well, hand it over so I can open it.
And that's a lie, right?
Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.
Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
That's incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.
Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.

I told you, no.
No, you said, would it help if I said I'm sorry?
Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?
Jews don't have heaven.
Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
Oh, you can't be serious.
Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
Get out of my lab.
Get out.
It was great. We talked about movies.
I showed him some card tricks.
Something got you down there, bunky?
Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn't believe in to end his life quickly.
You're kidding.
You don't seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.
No!
What if he doesn't?
That's an interesting idea. Why don't you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
You walk away.
Well, don't be too mean.
I wouldn't mind a glass.
Sheldon, come on back.
I'll give your paper to Professor Hawking.
But in exchange, I'd like you to do a few things for me.
Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?

That's nice.
Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I'll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you're seeing there is splash back.
Sheldon, these look great. They're like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How'd you get them so shiny?
Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.

Hey.
It's not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
Wow, are these Amy's? Kind of trashy, good for her.
Ugh. Why are you washing Howard's man panties?
Yeah, yeah, I know, he's the wheelchair dude who invented time.
I don't understand, why doesn't Howard just introduce you to the guy?
Well…
I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.
Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.
See, there it is, there's that twinkle.
What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?
Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.
Sheldon! I need your help!
It's this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It's like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!
We're gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.
It's easy, just pretend you're putting away a sleeping bag.
Now zip me up.
You're right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?
Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.
I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.
I don't know.
All right, Sheldon, there's only one thing left I want you to do. Don't worry, it's an easy one.
Give me a compliment.
No, about my job. I want you to tell me I'm good at what I do.
Well, then why are you always ripping on me?
Thank you, Sheldon.
Sorry, I can't.
I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.

I know.
My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.
Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.
That's nice. Too bad it's wrong.
You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.
Are you saying I do?

Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.
Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
Anyway, if it's okay with you, we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.
Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They've got that wine train.
Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.
Are you drinking whisky?
Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei's house.
Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.
Hear! Hear!
Sheldon…
Does anyone have any words they'd like to say about our man of the evening?
Sheldon…
She was my second cousin.
Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.
Actually, you did do one of them together.
What is this?
No, but what is it?
All right. More Sailor Moon for me.

Do you think maybe it's tight because you're wearing long underwear?
All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?
No, it should be: why are you?
Why don't you slip this on?
You must be burning up.
He keeps emergency Purell in the car.

Seven o'clock, right on time.
Well, dinner's almost ready.
Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.
With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I've decided that we should make progress in ours as well.
I had a feeling you'd be reluctant, which is why I'm going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.
Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I'm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.
We'll see. Let's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?
Yes.
Fine. There's no reason we still can't have a lovely dinner. Why don't you have a seat.
May I offer you something to drink?
Not even strawberry Quik?
Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.
Just like your mommy used to make.

Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?
Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?
We got you that book last year. Wasn't everything in there?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.
I guess we are. So, what's going on?
Shame on her.
She's good.
You mean, like in bed or in the shower?
Well, if you had a physical relationship, I'd say propose during sex. Turns out that's a real mood killer.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
I love his eidetic memory, it's so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?
You're nervous? I've been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I'm wearing my fat pants.
Well, it was going to be mine.
Come on, Sheldon, it'll be fun.
Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?
Why wasn't it a real proposal?
There's got to be some place special we could do it.
Great, well, who's it going to be?
No.
Oh, thanks, man.
Oh, wow.
What?
Yeah, so?
I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.
No.
Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that's the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.
Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.
By the power vested in us, by the state of California…
This is it.
Right now, Howard's staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.
Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.

Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…
Where do you stand on it?
Hey.
Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't?
Oh, okay. Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?
Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.
Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?
Sheldon, this place is so romantic.
Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.
I don't understand. What's he doing here?
On our date? Sheldon, that's not okay.
My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn't this romantic?
Have I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis?
You know what's wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.
Dessert is served.
You know what? I'm done with this.
I'm leaving.
You do?
Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.
Sheldon, that was beautiful.
I'll take it.
Go ahead.
Yes, I read you, Sheldon.
What are you doing?
You're out of your mind,Sheldon.
Bye.
Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.
Sheldon, you are not in charge.
What's the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn't want to sit by myself.
It'll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.
I can take them or leave them.
Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?
Okay. Should we go?
All right.
I went to art school.

Well, I like it.
Just watch the movie.
There might be a reason for that.
Penny said she's not sure she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.
So?
It's complicated.
She's not sure how she feels.
Regardless, don't say anything to Leonard.
Yes, please, Penny will kill me.
Raisinet?
What are you doing?
Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
I'm starting to get a sense of it. Don't worry. I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
Okay.
Why?
I wish there were more.
What is it?
Okay, I think I understand.
The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.

What?
I was. Now I'm having a nightmare. What do you want?

Oh, my God. Sheldon?
What are you doing in my bedroom?
How did you even get in, you weirdo?
What do you want, Sheldon?
Sheldon.
Okay, go home, crazy man.
Okay, what did Amy tell you?
Okay, you listen to me. I think it's really sweet you're trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?
Of course not.
Worst bedtime story ever.
Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?
Get out.
What?
That is the last thing I want to do.
Hang on, please. Hello?
I know. She's yelling at me right now.
Temple of Yip.
All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.
In case you didn't follow that, I'm the coffee.
Why would I be interested? I have Penny.
No, please don't ruin this for me.
Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.
What's your point?
I like Mark Ruffalo, too.
Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It's from your mom.
M-hmm.
Mmm, doesn't matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.
Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?
Really, your potty training journal?
August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?
Sorry!
Of course, it is, it's been in the news. And it's a very famous boson.
Yeah, that's basically what I said.
You really think there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?
So, you're going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
Not gonna happen.
Maybe I could do it.
A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I'm just a blonde monkey to you, aren't I?

No, thanks. I'm fine.
I don't do drugs.
No, of course not. How did you know about that?
Yes, I did.
Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.
It's not flattery if it's the truth.
Sheldon, aren't you going to introduce us?
It's nice to meet you. I'm so excited to be working with Dr…
Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?
This should be fun.
Yes.
Rainbow, not chocolate.
One on top, one on the bottom.
I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.
Um…
Given her what?
What?
Thank you.
Isn't that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
What do you got?
She seems nice.
The Fantastic Four reunited.
We're not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
I don't have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.
Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard's final descent has begun.

Me, too. But we'll see him tomorrow.
You're unbelievable.
How about boys versus girls?
Once again, unbelievable.
All right, round one. Here.
Present! Yeah!
In what universe is that a present?
No.
Nothing with quarks.
How could you miss that?
Penny got it.
Relax, we got time, this is so fun.
Soon.
Yep!
Hey, Sheldon, you're always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?
I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome where they'd actually chop somebody's ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.
Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It's a pretty well-rounded game.
All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.
Oh, come on, what is that?
En el acelerador de particulares.
No, no, we're not playing some dumb made-up game.
No good, Sheldon doesn't float.
All right, let's keep it simple. How about darts?
Why not?
We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
I'm trying. Don't yell at me.
Yes, we win again.
Remember, show your work.
Mwah!
Mwah!
So?
Sheldon, we haven't won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face.
Not now!
To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.”
Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don't go there for the food, you go there for the view.
Not really.

I think I'm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.
Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.
Yeah?
Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don't even like.
I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can't we find something that we're both happy with?
On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
It's funny because bread sounds like dead.
Hello, boys.
So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy's tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.
I don't care. Get the Tardis.
Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?
No.
It's called being nice.
You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won't talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.

You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.
No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he's not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.
Sheldon, get in here.
I'm Raggedy Ann, and he's Raggedy C-3PO.
You're welcome, ladies.
Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.
That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.”
I'm not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.
That's really nice, Sheldon, I'm happy for you.
Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.
Sheldon, I don't think this actually means…

Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.
It's exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
Oh, you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points.
Sorry.
Sheldon, you okay?
The guy's a genius. Maybe you weren't challenging enough for him.
There's the problem. You can't beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy's a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.
One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.

What are you doing?
I did a bad thing.
Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn't want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.
I don't know what to do. I mean, the paper's terrible. But if I tell her, she'll know that I read it and she'll get really mad.
Is it possible we're having two different conversations?
Hang on. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We'll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.
He's probably busy. You're worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I'm sure he'll play, and you'll see that everything's fine. My turn. I can't let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it's bad without letting her know that I read it?
Maybe since you're so good, he's taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school…
Sheldon, I wasn't done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she's my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren't I allowed to help her?
No. You need to give me some advice.
No, specific to my situation.
Empathetic.
I quit.
What?
It'll be okay.
Yeah, but if he's a sore loser, maybe you're better off without him.
So, now all you have to do is let him win.
What are you waiting for? Hit send.
So do it.
Then don't do it.
Good for you.
Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you're smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I'm the one who learned a lesson. I'm so stupid, Penny. Duh.

Well answer it. I want to hear.
Hello. I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.
Or should I say Dr. Loser? Ha, ha, ha.
Do you like brain teasers?

Don't worry, it wasn't terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.
Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.
Um, no offence, but I've been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.
Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth. Let's try it again. Everybody's having fun. And action.
Problem, first-time director?
He was overacting on purpose.
You gonna let him speak to me like that?
Can I speak to you for a second?
I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.
Fine. Then maybe I should go.
You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
Hey, look who's out after dark, like a big boy.
I thought you had plans with Amy.
Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
Then Amy got mad and left?
And you?
Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.
Trust me, call her.
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.
I'm not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn't do anything.
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That's it. End of story. Good night.

What?
Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?
Hey. What brings you in?
I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?
You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?
Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It'll warm her twaddle.
Honey, you can't make people like each other.
You might want to pace yourself.
Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.
Sorry.
Welcome to Long Island, Tex.
Yeah, that she is. Here you go.
No, she won't.

Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
Have you been drinking?
Why are you here?
Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.
Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we're gonna fight?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.
What are you drawing over there?
You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
Do you expect me to build this?
Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.
Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?
Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it's like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
Well, where are you going?
No, you didn't.
It's not a big deal. He's just in her history class. They're working on a project together. I don't even know why I care. You know what, I don't care.
This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
What do you mean?
Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks. I'm, I'm way above average in a lot of other things.
I'm talking about important things like emotional maturity.
I liked it better when you thought I wasn't here.
None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.
What?
Now you're just being ridiculous.
I'll be right back.
I don't know.
Wormhole generator test?
Holy crap!
Aah! It's eating his face!
Yeah, really sorry.
And what does forty-three mean?

All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.
Good boy. Here's a cookie.
Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it's parked right out front, space 294.
Yeah.
Why do you have a parking spot? You don't have a car. You don't even drive.
Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I'm sure they'll give you another parking space.
Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.
Are you listening to yourself?
Nope.


Well, he's not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.
Sheldon, let it go. It's not a big deal.
All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
Give it back.
My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.
Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.
Fine. I'm taking your diploma.
Sheldon?
I don't have any.
Hi Sheldon.
He wasn't using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
Give me back my Iron Man helmet.
This is so exciting. I'm feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
Freaking pigs.
Wait, I'm leaving my car here?
Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.
What do you think?

What the hell are you doing?
You can't stay there forever.
Those aren't gonna help you, Sheldon,
I'm warning you, Sheldon!
Get out of my spot.
What are you idiots doing?
It's not just a parking spot. He can't handle the fact that I'm a bigger deal than he is now.
Oh, like you've never thought of doing that. Don't hate me just because I lived the dream.
What are you doing in there?
Stop that. You stop that.
Hey, got a minute?
Thank you.
Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don't know what to say.
I'd like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.
Can I help you?
A what?
Lipid what?
Tuesday okay?
Let me write you a ticket.
Uh-huh.

Why would it trouble you? It's, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.
Turtle power!
Yeah, so?
It's torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.
Thanks, Sheldon. I'll try that with my father-in-law.
Great, thank you.
What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?
That should lighten the mood.

Hello, Sheldon.
I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.
Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?
But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.
Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.
Thank you, Sheldon.

Sheldon, you don't get over the flu in half an hour.
I have to say, I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.
Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.
Sheldon, this isn't helping. Why don't you just let me get some rest.
You, you want to rub something on my chest?
Maybe we should start with that.

That was great. Rub my chest again.
How's the poor thing?
Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there's a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.
I don't have a bath thermometer.
All right. I'll tell him.
Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you're back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I'm going to need another bath.
Oh?
All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It's just been so nice having you take care of me.
I feel terrible I did this.
I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?
I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
Are you saying you want to spank me?

One second. I want to put on some music.
I don't want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
Oh, my.
Then maybe you should spank me harder.
Oh, great! I've always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.
Why not?
By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.
What's wrong with Christmas?
Pirate with a peg leg?
Would you just look inside?
It's actually ho, ho, ho, but you'll get the hang of it. Thought it'd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.
Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?
But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?
Hey, guys. I don't mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you'd like to see what you're missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette's wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there's Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I'm assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.
I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”
Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.
Seven, six.
Somebody sing the damn song.
The walls are getting slower.
How did you know that?
Okay, continuing our quest.

Done?
Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
I don't know. What's the difference?
Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
You see those, too.
What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?
No, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.
Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you've got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You're getting a little Yuletide spirit.
I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there because the paper would be graded.
It wasn't amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.

My carpal tunnel's acting up.
I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.
Wait, what are you doing?
Uh, okay.
This is weird, right?

Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.
Oh. I've been wanting to talk to you. I'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.
But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.
Oh, it's better than a train.
Better.
Okay, open 'em.  This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!

I can't blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.
What recordings?
What?
I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
I'm androgynous?
What is happening?
Who's involved?
You're talking about Leonard.
It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?
Wait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?
Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.
She's right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.
We know what's going on, Sheldon!
Well, Alex is your employee. If she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.
Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.

I think it's pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here's something at four o'clock. Give Alex a talking to?
Is there a problem?
What did I do?
What? I didn't make a sexual advance on anybody.
What?
This conversation is making me uncomfortable.
I have to go.
I'm missing something.  Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
Why would you do that?
At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
Oh, my God, what did you do?
Come in.
Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.
I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.
Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.
Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.
I'm a what?
Whuh-ah! Woah! You can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.
Hofstadter… Wolowitz… and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?
I'm sorry, I'm a feminist, I don't notice things like how many breasts a robot has.
What are you doing here?
And I'm a little busy right now.
And who was that?
That's it. All of you, in my office now!

Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
Okay.
Hey, will you steam my uniform next?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.
Well, it's a lot smaller. It's more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.
Well, then why are you going?

It is on.
Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.
What did you do?
Really?
You know, we're not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
Yeah, that sounds fun.
No.
Recalculating. While we're waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.
And we're blending, and we're blending, and we're done.
Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?
Stop!
Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?
What kind of a person steals another person's car in broad daylight?
I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.
What is wrong with people? Why don't they stop?
Look at us, Sheldon. We're the crazy people.
Come on, let's just start walking. There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.
Yes.
Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It's not gonna de-funk my junk.
Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.

Why don't you ask Scotty to beam you up?
Fine, then I guess it's two against two. How do we decide?
What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.

You don't know his life.
If it's an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.
I say we investigate.
What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?
No.

Cooper?
What's that?
I have some bad news. You're working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I'm working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.
No, they're making us work together.
Want me to make you some tea?
So, cocoa?
Oh, teacher! Me! Me!
Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.
We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.
You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.
How do I know you're not going to do that with mine?
Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other's work, meet again tomowow?
Nice twy. This is bwank paper.
Cough it up, Cooper.
If this one's bwank, too, I'm going to be fuwious.
The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I'm supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it's hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You've been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?
All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?
Sheldon, what's going on?
Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?
How's that?
Come on, Sheldon, we're going to be late.
You're not sick. You just don't want to face Kripke.
128.
What did you do, put this in your tea?
Sheldon, Kripke's not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.
Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.
Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.
Don't pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.
You have a girlfwiend.
So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.
You wucky bastard.
Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we're gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.
All right, I don't understand. Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?
Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
You ever going to sleep with Amy?
Maybe you don't, I do. What's the deal?
All right, we're down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?
Then what's the problem?
Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
Oh, my God!  Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.

Gave it to her good, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?
How could you not notice?
Ah, you're kiwing me, Cooper!
Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?
I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.
Why would you say that?
That was a huge spoiler.
Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
You are unbelievable. I don't know why I put up with you. You're controlling, you're irritating.
You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.
That's it. I don't, I don't have to put up with this.
Aw. Here's what I think of your roommate agreement.
No.
I don't care. I don't have to do anything you say because I don't think I want to live here anymore.
To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.
What?

Children's toy.
Children's toy.
So, uh, what's your plan moving forward?
No.
Like a dog-boy.
What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
Great. Here I am!
Me. Aren't I your perfect roommate?
Think about it, Sheldon. I'm not a stranger, we're intellectually compatible, I'm willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?
Tell me one reason why this isn't a fantastic idea.
See? You can't. I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.

What do you want?
Is that so?
Cut to the chase, Sheldon.
It's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.
Well, maybe he doesn't know how to say it without hurting her feelings.
That is the worst, isn't it?
Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?

Okay. Listen, the truth is I don't want him living with me.
No, I don't want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.
Well, you know how he is. He's sensitive and emotional.
Well, I don't know what else we can do but tell them the truth.
Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. I did good, right?
No.
Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.
And this is Amy.
Beep.
What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn't break in.
Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.
Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss 'cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you're ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can't live here.
What?
Sheldon, what did you say?
Oh, don't get all huffy. You're the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.
And since you love the truth so much, why don't you tell Amy you don't want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?
You're a coward.
Um…
No.


Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I've been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.
You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.

Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.
No, I just thought it would be…
Okay. Um, I know she's a fan of The Canterbury Tales.
So I found this cool map that illustrates the character's journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.
I don't know how to respond to that.
Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy's a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.
Thank you.
What about your girlfriend?
Hello.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.
And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine's Day.
By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.
Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?
Well, then, that's what we're going to do.
I'm your girlfriend. That's my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.
What's this?
Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?
In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler. And there's my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could've ever given me.
And you picked me.
Oh, Sheldon.

Hello.
Yeah, I can't tell you how many times I've been at a party where everyone's talking about flags and I just couldn't join in.
I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It's something we work on in my acting class.
Yeah, let's try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you're all hunched like that, you're shutting the audience out, but when you're relaxed and open, you're inviting them in.
Let's try open.
Um, well, I'm from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?
Hello, Sheldon.
Fine. Just hold on. Mommy's on the phone! Sorry. We've cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.
Oh, that's right. How'd it go with Penny?
Subtle, but powerful.
Because she's your friend, and she did a nice job. I'm sure she'd like to hear it.
Oh, hi. What's up?
You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
Okay. So, what do you need?
Really?
Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.
Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.
That's right. They're no good without the lighter.
Why? What happened?
Sheldon, that's very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.

What?
Hey, I don't want you to go any more.
You should go 'cause you want to go, not because you have to.
Okay. Do whatever you want.
Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.

He's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.
He's upset because he can't get anywhere with women.
I'm sorry. That I asked.
Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.
You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.
Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.
She's pretty good, huh?
…when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That's how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.
Our Penny's a star.
I got whine.
Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn't have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.
Helping women? Y
Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?
You don't think it's worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.
Yes, I know, you're too smart for this.
Got it. All right, I'm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.
So, you think I'm one of the smarter kids?
Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game
Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.
Sheldon, you're always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
That's actually good. Why didn't I think of that?
That's great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.
What exactly are you looking up?
Well, they're actually pretty excited. I'm their most famous alum. If you don't count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.
Nothing.
Okay, who's ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, 'cause that's the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let's bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let's get out of here.
We're here.
Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.
Oh, well, I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as good if I hadn't tried your food first.
Colour's fine.
Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.
Sheldon, come on. It's getting late. Time to go.
That's what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let's move it.
Sheldon, it's, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.
Juggle.
Oh, my God, it's beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
Whoa, you opened this?
If I wanted to know, I would've opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let's get out of here.
Do whatever you want.

Hey, Sheldon.
You have something we want.
No, we just want information.
We heard you read the letter from Howard's father.
What did it say?
Sheldon, that's not a real thing.
Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet. Doesn't that count for something?
Yeah, obviously.
Hey, where have you been?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you've been gone a long time.
What information?
Well, come on, we won't tell anyone.
Fine, then that.
Aw.
Absolutely.
So everybody knows what's in that letter except for me?
Use me as a human shield!
Oh, yeah, what's that?
We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…
Sheldon.
Told you.
Really?
It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn't who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
No, it's not.
Okay.
Sheldon, don't you dare.
That's more like it.
If you'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you'd be happy all the time.
Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.
Only if you're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.
And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.
Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.
Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can't get tenure, I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.
Excuse me, but I think I'm just as qualified as you are.

Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?
Do they know they don't stand a chance 'cause you're so great?

Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.
You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.
You don't say.
Is that a problem?
God, they're everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?
Uh, Dr. Cooper, that's not necessary.
Roots?
Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?
This meeting has come to an end.
Probably not.
Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.
It sounds like a long and tedious evening.
Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.
Of course it would. I'm well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.
Let's go over our emotional responses one last time.
Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?
The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn't make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?
Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?
No.
Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
Excuse me. I'm here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.
I'm here to support my man, just like you.
Do it.
She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard's cause.
You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.
Yes.
Well, now it's biguous. What are you gonna do about it?
You could talk some smack about his mother.
How about it, Sheldon?
Well, you'll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you'll make any more friends.
Yeah, screw it. I'm going in.

What?
Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.
Good.
You're welcome.  I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.

No.
Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.
I don't know. It's a fat guy on a Segway. That's funny everywhere.
You know, if you're trying to make space on the DVR, why don't you just get rid of some of the stuff you've already watched? Like, um, Alphas.
There is no season three. They cancelled that show.
Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?
As a rule, no.
Well, why don't you make up your own ending?
Oh, please, don't do that.

I'm sorry you're upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.
You know, I might be able to help you with this. There's a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.
You sure about that?
I've come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.
I'm going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn't so overwhelming.
Yep. Your turn.
Exactly. How does that make you feel?
And that's exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
Come on, you can do this.
That's quite an impressive layout, isn't it?
Let's box it up.
Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can't come true.

I'm a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.
And?
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.
Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you're in my life.

Got it.
Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
You're kidding. He's still alive?
Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.
Hire him to do what?
It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn't I?
Do you remember his old theme song?
How'd you get him to come to your house?
And he wrote him a cheque.
Yes.
Great.
Well, I can, so shut up.
Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
No.
Okay, good night.
What?

Relax, Sheldon, he's only a few minutes late.
Where is he?
I agree.
Just, just call me Arthur.
No. A friend would've, would've told me about the elevator.
Actually, he's a genius.
Well, I hope I haven't, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.
You know, I'm a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.
No, no. I, I hate that puppet.
I think I know.
Okay, I didn't know.
I, I figured that out.
No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I'm done.
I don't know. I think I'm just, I, I just, I just don't want to be Professor Proton any more.
What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I'm, I'm an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I'm a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.
What do you two talk about?
I'll, I'll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.
No, I, I get that.
I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
No, that's not a rule. He can go.
Well, at, at this point, I'm just glad someone's carrying me down the stairs.

Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.
No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.
No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.
Well, I'm, I'm booked to do a children's party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don't feel up to it.
Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you'd fill in for me.
Yeah.
Or a Korean family in Alhambra.
Sounds great.
What, Whatever.
It's gonna get crazy.

Ready whenever you guys are.
Yeah?
Oh, that's nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.
See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.
We'll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali's bloody corpse, and says,  don't worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest.  Well, I'm just a tree, but if I were you, I'd listen to your ghost friend.
Uh, it does.
Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon.  Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn.
You guys enjoy your evening. I'm gonna go before I ruin anybody else's weekend.
No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it's not the night you had in mind, but why don't you guys stay and play with us? It'll be fun.
What's the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.
So, what do you say?
Okay, who wants a drink?
Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!
I draw my broadsword.
Fifteen's the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we're playing for money.
Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.
The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.
But wait., he's not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.
Fine.  You'd think, after all these years, I'd know not to fly over volcanoes. I'm a freaking idiot.
It's a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.
Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.
Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I'm gonna take you on a whole different adventure.
Sheldon, they're talking about sex.
I don't like this.

What?
You don't have to come in here and cheer me up.
I'll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.
Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?
Do you have any interest now?
Wow. Talk dirty to me.
I guess I know that. It's just, part of me wants more.
Come on. Let's go back out there.
Okay.
Oh.
I kiss you on the lips.
I remove your armour. What do you do?
Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?
I'd love that, but she's not really comfortable around people.
How's that been working for you?
I have a job.
He knows, wow.
Hey, don't discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.

What do you think?
Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
I know what you're doing. You don't want me going on this research trip because you're afraid to be alone.
Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me.
There's beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don't need to make a big deal.
The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.
A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.

Yeah, it does, and here we are.
Well, I'm his girlfriend, of course I'm gonna support him.
Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.
Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.
Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn't take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn't very good at her job.
It wasn't me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…
I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I'm happy for you. Because that's what friends do.
Yeah.
Like this. I am so happy for you.
She is. She's just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She'll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?
Thank you, Sheldon. That must've been very hard for you to say.
It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.
Me, too.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.
Would you just relax?
Oh, Leonard.
I love you, too.
Sheldon, it's not a great time, what do you want?
What is it?
So?
Sheldon, I got to go inside. It's getting rough out here.
What was what?
Okay, I'm hanging up now. You know there's no such thing as a k…

What's the matter?
Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?
Aw.
Good night.
You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
Well, you should be, 'cause she was looking good.
Is that true?
Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy's out of town, would you like to join us?

No.
Why don't you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?
Mmm.
Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.
All right, let's just get this stupid game over with.
Okay.
Why?

Really? Why?
Okay, let's take a break.
I wasn't going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard's doing right now. I miss him so much.
I'm calling him.
Best time of my life.
Uh-oh, hang on.
Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.
I can't believe it. All this time I've been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?
No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
No. Come on, you're supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he's partying is to cover up his pain.
This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he's off having a good time?
Okay, that, that's great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.
He did?
Oh, that's really sweet.
Well, now I miss him even more.
Thanks.

Come on. It's still early. Let's do something.
How about we just talk?
No. Come on, let's talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don't know.
Okay, that, that's a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.
How about I go first?
Okay, look, here's something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.
Oh, God.
Okay.
That's your big revelation?
Okay, you know what? I give up. I'm going to bed.
What did I do?
I, I didn't think it was a big deal.
Sheldon, you are right. I'm really sorry. I should've known better.
Thank you. How about a hug?
Come on.

Another? Great.
Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
You know, I will miss this.
I won't.
Oh, I just cannot believe you're here.

Happy to, unless it's hope or a reason to live.
Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.
Yeah, just as well. It's a pretty rare piece. I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.
Well, we've all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
All right, Sheldon, you win. I'm sure Leonard is gonna love this.
Ooh, yeah, I don't know. This squirt gun, it's, uh, it's pretty rare.
Oh. Okay. Well, here's, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won't call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.
That's nice.
Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…
Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.  Have a good night!
No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet's been doing that. I called the building manager, so…
Well…
Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it's okay. You don't have to go into the bathroom.
Oh. Well, you know, I, I've got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.
Oh.
Um, what?
So? That's my dinner from last night.
Okay. Look, honey, I promise there's no one's here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.
What?
No.
Oh, and here's a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you're not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.
Then what does tweepadock mean?
Lucky guess.
What happened?
What?
I don't think Penny would cheat on Leonard.
You're being ridiculous.
Do you hear anything?
Is it Penny?
Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.
Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.
No, Sheldon, don't.
What the hell?
Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.
That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
The what?
Please leave me out of this.
Come on, I said I was sorry.
Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It's that sailor cap that you wanted. It's neat, huh?
Ooh, now we're talking.
Good morning.
So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
Where do you think I would take you?
I'm going to work. You can come if you want.
No, I don't.
Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren't?
Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
Fine. What I did was wrong.
You know what? I'm not driving you to work, because you're incredibly annoying.
Stop it.
Bye.
I don't know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can't be good.
Hey, Sheldon.
Come on, don't be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.
Sheldon.
Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard. Penny's got nothing to do…
Really?
You want to take the bus to work?
That's so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.
You know what? You're a crazy person.
Stop it.
Okay.

I'm so glad you guys are friends again.
Aw.
Fifty cents off Vagisil.
Uh, can I just say, I've missed all of us hanging out together.

Another? Great.
You know, I will miss this.
I won't.
Oh, I just cannot believe you're here.

Happy to, unless it's hope or a reason to live.
Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.
Yeah, just as well. It's a pretty rare piece. I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.
Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?
Ooh, yeah, I don't know. This squirt gun, it's, uh, it's pretty rare.
Oh. Okay. Well, here's, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won't call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.
That's nice.
Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…
Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.  Have a good night!
No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet's been doing that. I called the building manager, so…
Well…
Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it's okay. You don't have to go into the bathroom.
Oh. Well, you know, I, I've got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.
Oh.
Um, what?
Okay. Look, honey, I promise there's no one's here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.

No, Sheldon, don't.
What the hell?
Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.
I'm sorry, Sheldon. I should've told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.
That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
The what?
Please leave me out of this.

Good morning.
So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
Where do you think I would take you?
I'm going to work. You can come if you want.
No, I don't.
I didn't make it back. The ship sank, I'm in hell.
Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren't?
Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
Fine. What I did was wrong.
You know what? I'm not driving you to work, because you're incredibly annoying.

You know what? You're a crazy person.
Stop it.
Okay.

I'm so glad you guys are friends again.
Aw.
Fifty cents off Vagisil.
Uh, can I just say, I've missed all of us hanging out together.
No, you weren't because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.
Great.
Why?
Oh, that's cute. Like it's a real college.
I'm in, let's do it.
What's all this?
You really think he's gonna send us to a bowling alley?
Okay, everybody. Who's ready for a scavenger hunt?  Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I've hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p…  each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.
Ha-ha.
No, no. Let's mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we're gonna kick your ass!
All right, hurry up and close the door so they can't hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.
No.
All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.
Well, there's no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.
Ooh, ooh, it's the comic book store. All right, come on, that's where we have to go.
But, it, it doesn't matter. We know the answer, come on.
Okay, it's not gonna say that.
It's the comic book store, it's the comic book store, it's the comic book store.
Ugh, we're the last ones here, hurry up.
People run in a marathon.
Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.
Aha. Okay, let's see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.
Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I've got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?
Yes.
Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
Shut up. I solved it.
Well, wait. Don't you want to know how I figured it out?
Okay. Oh, it's a bowling alley.

Three bags, no one's opened 'em. we're the first ones here.
What? Why me?
Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.
Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let's do this.
Oh.
This one is, too.
Sheldon's spot. The coin is in your spot.
Hurry.
I just wanted to do something beautiful.

It was good.
I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.
It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren't in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.
Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It's perfect.
Whatcha doin'?
So you're looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
Mm-hmm. And?
Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn't know how big he was gonna be.
Sorry, buddy.
I'll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?
Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.
So what can I do for you?
Really?
That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?
Of course I'm in.
Good night, Dr. Cooper.
I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.
You're trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Sheldon, we're in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don't need to seek revenge.
Well, that's not how we're going to do it.
I shouldn't have said it. I'm sorry.
Do you feel better?
Wait, wait, if it wasn't for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse.
It's actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon's looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.
How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.
I've been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn't that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool.
So, you're okay with this?
Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there's the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.
Sheldon, don't defecate where you eat means don't have a romantic relationship in the workplace.
Yes.
I'm relieved that you don't have a problem with us working together.
Are you crazy? You don't want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.
No, no, I think it'll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.
Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.
You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That's right, my phone is just as smart as you guys.
I don't mind. I'm hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque.
Sheldon, I don't understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.
He said what?
Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband.
Yeah, and you can't tell her what she can and cannot do.
Sheldon, you don't have to worry about me bothering you. I'll be in a different building. And we don't even have to have lunch together.
Yes. Before all things, I'm a scientist. I'm just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.
More and more sure.
I didn't ask for your permission.
No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there'd be too much of me for you, not the other way around.
Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it's true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we'd get sick of each other.
Bernie…
Hey.
That was kind of icy. You two okay?
Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj's hair.
And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.
Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?
Sheldon.
Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let's kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we're talking.
What do you want, Sheldon?
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?
Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
I can't leave now, Sheldon. I'm very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor.
You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup.
You know what? I don't have time for this. Find another way home.
Really? What tipped you off?
Get out.
Image number six, woman giving birth.
It's nine o'clock, where you been?
Oh, no.
I did not.
Why'd you get that? You hate lamb.
I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.
Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?
Yeah.
Sheldon, I've known you a long time, and I'm going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy's right. You're wrong.
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?

Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?
No.
What do you want?
Sheldon, you're not a weirdo.
What's your point?
I like you, too.
What are you working on?
Guys, listen up.
Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.
Sheldon?
Well, for starters, you've broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?
Sheldon?
Sheldon, I know you're in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but you haven't spoken in hours and I'm starting to get worried. Please say something.
Nope, it was better before.
Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?
Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.
Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.
Sheldon, that's incredible.
So, what happens next?
Good to know.
I don't think the Smithsonian's gonna want your marker.
Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.
What's next?
And what?
What's wrong?
What are you talking about?
That Americans can't handle the metric system?
But the Chinese team found the element.
So you just got lucky?
You and me both, brother. It doesn't matter. The element was found because of you, and that's groundbreaking.
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we're forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.
: You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.
Oh, people get things they don't deserve all the time. Look at me with you.
Buddy, I don't think you can. I mean, once it's out there, it's out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.
You don't know what a sex tape is, do you?
There he is.
Woo!
Wait, I don't understand. They didn't find the element?
I'm getting worried about Bernadette. I'm gonna call and check on her.
Oh, that's a big deal.
I'm not.
Sheldon, I've been thinking about it, and you're right. You don't deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you.
Oh, no.
Sheldon, get over here.
If I didn't have you, life would be blue, I'd be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.
Howie, that was amazing. Look, I'm shaking.

Me? What did I do?
Sorry.
Oh, Sheldon.
That's because you've never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.
He thinks there's a difference.
Trust me, I, I remember.
No, she's not.
Sheldon.
Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.
Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.
He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I'd take a look at it.
Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.

Is it really worth getting upset about?
Come on, he's a retired kids show host.
Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?
Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.
From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…
Doesn't matter.
Sheldon.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Of course you woke me, it's seven thirty.
What do you want, Sheldon?
She sounds like a keeper.
All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.
Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.
I should be so lucky.
You know, if it's all the same with you, I, I think I'll, I'll stick with Leonard.
Good night.
You're annoying.
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I'm just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it's really interesting.
Why is it odd?
He said I'd be speaking to a class.

Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.
No, no, no, I'm, I'm here, I'm here to see you.
No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to get your opinion about my, my paper.
Oh. Uh, great.
And, what did you think?
Mmm. Thank you.
Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.

He can't help it. He can't. He really can't.
That one over there.
Skee-Ball tickets?
Yup, oh, here you go.
Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.
Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they're not in there.
No, no, no, I, I looked, and there's, there's, there's no more tickets.
Okay, okay. I'm gonna show you what's in the box. But just promise not to flip out.
Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it's been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?
I'm sorry. I'll, I'll take care of it.
I mean it, I'm going to.
And you're going to stay calm?
So, when you say you're not going to freak out about the DVD, here's what that means. Don't fixate on it. Don't wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I'm on the toilet.
When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?
Well, I don't know how to do that.
That's stupid. Why?
I'm telling you, try the hanger.
You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I'm gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.
Really?
Is the point that you're an idiot?
Hey, what're you working on?
That's a pretty cool idea.
Sure.
Or it's resolved.
I must say, Sheldon, you're handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.
I'm gonna go with sad. So what's the story with you and this DVD?
Seriously?

I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?
Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.
Oh, oh, no, no. It's because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn't a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I'm not Armenian, so it probably won't work. This is over, right?
Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.
Why isn't this bothering you? Isn't your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn't this making you crazy?
What?
What?
Sheldon, that was diabolical.
Yes, it is.
Mmm. I'm gonna say not. That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she's snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.
Please? Bernadette's bringing her dad 'cause her mom's out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.
It'd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
Sheldon.

We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
Yeah, they are.
But it didn't seem real.
No traffic, we're sailing.
Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate. You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.
I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
Happy Thanksgiving.
Wuh, Penny.
I'm trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?
How the hell do you know that?
What do you think they ought to do now?

Yeah, that's why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?
I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.
So, does your dad still live in Texas?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.
Well, you're having one with me.
I never had a beer with my dad, either.

I don't know what's scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.
Hey. Howie says you've been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.
All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.
Thank you.
Sheldon.
Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?
Well, I'm drunk.
This is Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.
And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.
It's just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It's like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.
That's interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn't that be unusual? Because you're a physicist.

I know you don't like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.
How can you not be happy? You're tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.
Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.

Sheldon, can I come in?
No.
Hey, Sheldon. It's been a while.
Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?
Yeah, I know a little something about that.
I remember why it's been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.
Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.
I'm just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow. But now, it's just one small part of a pretty great life, and it's a part that I'm happy is there.
Good.
Okay.
Can I blow the whistle?

Hey, you're in a good mood.
Well, you're about to be in an even better one. I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.
Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.
Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
No, it's all over.
Well, you're welcome.
I, I don't understand. All you've done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.
Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don't even live near each other.
Hey, what's with all the yelling?
Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled,
He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?
The, the element never existed. I didn't take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.
Actually, I get what he's saying.
It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don't publish it, it's just a matter of time before someone else does.
Fine, I'll publish.
Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.
These things happen all the time, Sheldon.
Okay, Barry, that's enough.
Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That's pwetty hurtful. I, I can't contwol it.
Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
You know, if it makes you feel any better…
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night. Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?
Thanks.
It's all right.
Well…
He asked me.
As I was saying…
Sheldon.
You know, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it's okay with you.
Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.
A little early for alcohol, isn't it?
Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?
Where?
Is someone sick?
Oh, she's pregnant? That's great. You're gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.
How come you never said she was pregnant?
Well, congrats, and it's nice you're gonna be there for your sister.
Wow, so, how long will you be gone?
Can I give you a ride to the airport?
Hello.
Yeah, kinda.
Hey, how's your sister?
That's wonderful. So you're at the hospital?
Shelly, come on. Your sister's fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there's blood everywhere.
Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?
Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.
Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.
Hey, Sheldon.
Doing laundry?
So, what do you think?
Please, Sheldon. I need you.
To take me.
Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.
How's it going, Sheldon?
Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?
Where'd you go?
How's it going, Sheldon?
Congrats.
Well, good for you, buddy. We'll let you get back in there.
Come on, Sheldon, you should go.
Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.

Just really glad you're back.
I missed you.
Oh.
Did you hold the baby?
And? How did it make you feel?
Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
Oh, yeah
If you're really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.
It's a joke.
Oh, that's so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.

No. Do you?
I take it back. That was funny.
I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
You know, I think we're zeroing in on your problem.
Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you're cool with at you…
I know, but you're going to be a TV star and you haven't left me yet. That takes guts.
Why?
Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
Well, the diner scene. Where's my diner scene?
This doesn't make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.

Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…
Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn't funny.
Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological…  Okay, that's pretty good.

I guess.
Sure.
I don't think I want to go out with you anymore.
Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?
No, forget it. I take it back. Offer's off the table.
Really not a good time.
No, no, I just need to be alone.
No.
What?

No.
Penny proposed, and I didn't say yes.
That's a good question.
Because I'm afraid to know the answer.
That's it? You're not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?

I know.
You need to let it go, Sheldon.
Oh, my God, they're just making you use your vacation days.
Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through, but I'm a little distracted right now.
It doesn't.

No. You're on vacation.
Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
No.
No.
Oh, Sheldon, stay.
Oh. Hey, Sheldon.
You okay?
Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
Oh. Well, good boy.
Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.
Okay. You want to come with me?
Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.
In.
And out.
I didn't get it.
No. I'm serious.
Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
Really?
Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can't Leonard understand it?
And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let's try Warrior 2. And hold.
Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna get to do that today.
How did she get you to do yoga?
Sheldon, take a break.
Yeah, well, maybe we do.
Can we please have some privacy?
No.
For some reason, we're planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.
Look, I know you think I'm being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.
You keep saying you're on my side, but you don't act like it.
Well, it's scary for me, too.
Okay. Thank you.
Oh, I've got butterflies.
They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…
Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Anyone in?
I did it, I did it, I'm in the queue.
Oh, Thursday's gone. Just Sunday left.
Sunday's gone.
I can't believe we're not going.
Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.

Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.
I already found a guy online who's willing to sell.
Sheldon, just come with us. You're not gonna make your own convention.

Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.
Sheldon, buddy, I just don't think this is going to come together for you.
Good luck.
Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don't exist were over.
Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
Sheldon, I don't care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don't be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You're gonna get in trouble.
Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I've been in other movies. But you don't care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?
Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.
You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.
He was not. How messed up was that?

It is true.
They sure did.
That's right.


Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…

Shh.
Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night.
What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?
No. Something about a convention.
Why don't you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?
Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I'm taking you every night.
So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando's shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun.
Item 28, your pet name for me. Time's running out on this. You need to make a decision.
I'm sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.
We'll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine's Day.
Before you get upset, I believe I've come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.
I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.
Come on, Sheldon. Why not?
One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.
I got you your own room.
It doesn't. I know it makes you feel like you're bathing inside a monster.
We're going to have Valentine's Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.
That would really piss me off if I didn't have a buzz going on.
I'm sorry, what?
I don't own a pocket watch.
What do you think, Sheldon?
I'm so glad you like it.
And for the entrée, tonight's special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?
I'm sorry, I meant questions about the food.
Fun fact, it's neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you'll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.

Okay. Here's my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.
See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
Excuse me. You are at Valentine's dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.
Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?
Or was there?
In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.
Hold on to your conductor's hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.
You know, if you ask nicely, they'll let you visit the engine room.
It's feeling like it never will.
You guys missed a pretty great time.
It was crazy.
Why are you still here?
I'm being rude? You've been rude to me this entire evening.
I'm detecting a little friction between you two, and I don't want to be a third rail. Get it?
Leave.
It's Valentine's Day. We're supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
Fine, it's true. I deserve romance, and I didn't know how else to make it happen.
Sheldon.
That was nice.
Okay, have fun.

Oh, hey. You're back. How was your trip?
Great. What did you do?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna need more details.
No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?
Well, give it a go.
Additional data. You dog.
Guys, you're being childish.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl's there ten seconds, and suddenly we're all running to IKEA.
Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?
Hey, how come we never get that option?
Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?
Seriously? You haven't used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you're up here working?
Are you really gonna sit here all day?
If you'll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.
I'm putting all this stuff in storage. We don't need any of it.
Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.
Huh?
Nary an argument? Nary?
Hey, all set. What do you think? There's plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.
Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.
Well, you can't say he didn't give it a fair shot.
We're not.
That.
Well, it's always me, take one for the team.
Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That's just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy's changed you.
Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you're holding hands, you're going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.
You're too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.
Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.
Oh, Sheldon, wait.

I'm not surprised you want to end the relationship. I'm a little surprised you didn't get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?
Oh, I've already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.
Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He's manipulating you like he always does.
Well, thankfully, I won't have to see it, 'cause I won't be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.
Of course I was.
I think if I were manipulating you, you'd be smart enough to see it.
I think you'd be smart enough to see that, too.

Oh, hey. You guys didn't break up.
Which you also figured out by yourself.
Well, I'm glad you're still together.
Which is stronger than ever.
But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.
You don't need to explain yourself to him.
You're sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
So why are you trying to ruin it?
You mean tings like moo-stache?
Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.
While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
I think we're gonna go.
Hey, I work at the same university you do.
No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it's a fight.
I didn't do anything. I was just sitting here.
That was ten years ago.
Hey.
Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.
Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.
Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.
Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can't go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I'll show you around the space centre.
No.

Oh, it's no problem. Is everything okay?
Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn't sound good.
Yes.
Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.
Teams are fun.
How? Unlike me, you have a job. I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart interfering with your board game?
How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
You excited for Texas?
It's not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
Buzz Aldrin.

What now?
You just went to the bathroom.
Well, it still doesn't.
Fine.
I'm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.
When? How about in the car? I'm an astronaut, and you know it. You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.
Thank you.
No.
Here you go. Be creative. What's the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?
Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.

I'm sorry, too. It's all my fault.
Thank you, Sheldon.
It's over.
Should we stop holding hands now?

Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed. We should bring something.
Oh, boy.
Okay, give me the flowers and pie.
They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
What's wrong?
What? Sheldon, tell me what's going on.
Does a brisket count? I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough. But didn't she know we were coming?
Well, did she see you in the window?
Then don't say anything.
Well, don't do it on the phone.
That's some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.
Look, she's a grown woman. And, and your dad's been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.

While you confront your mother about her sex life? I'd rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
Shelly, I'm so glad you're here.
What are you talking about?
Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.
That's not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I'm sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.
His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.
A few months.
That is no way to speak to your mother.
I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.
Or I will send you to your room.
Go to your room.
Go to your room!
Hey, can I come in?
That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn't go smoothly with your mom.
You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.
I'm talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.
Well, let's just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she's basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.
All I'm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom's happiness.

Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?
Shelly, I'm sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.
You're right, it does, and it's something that I'm struggling with these days.
Because I'm not perfect, Shelly. And that man's booty is.
That is very Christian of you.
How old do you think I am?
Are you having the sex talk with me?
Oh, dear Lord.

If only there were a solution to that.
So go to the bathroom.
Why not?
Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?
I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.

Can you get the butter, please?
Then get the other one. Pass the butter.
Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.
No way.
Well, you wouldn't want your gaming system to overheat.
Included?
Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?
Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who's they?
You're kidding.

You're welcome.
Uh, it's date night. Aren't you, uh, forgetting something?
No.
Okay, that's enough.
Uh, Xbox One.
Huh?
PS4.
Both great.
I like the Wii.
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.
Well, that's got to be a good feeling.
Oh, crap.
You were just a little kid.
How old were you then?
What's a Zune?
No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it's good. You did the research.
You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?
Then I'll buy you a new entertainment centre.
How about this? I've heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you'll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.
So, heads it's PS4, tails it's Xbox One.
What is it?

Oh, I'm sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.
Let's get you some food. You, You'll feel better after you eat.
What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?
What do you think about it, Sheldon?
Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?
Oh, my God, you're jealous.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you've been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you're no closer to proving it than when you started.
Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.
No, but they did find evidence that you'll bewieve anything.
Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I'm gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.
Hey, you're up early.
I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
Is something bothering you?
Oh, come on, try me.
Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it's like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.
No.
No.
No. I'm saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it's like to be in one and realize it's never gonna turn out the way you want.
I'm talking about other guys.
You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?
She is. But I like that attitude.
You're really going to do this?
You're reading Cosmo?
What's this?
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?
Are you sure you want to do this?
Oh my God, I do look like that.
So, how do you want me to cut it?
Or I don't cut it and maybe just style it a little.
That doesn't work any more. He just thinks I'm taking him to the doctor. So, now that you're no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?
Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn't really understand it.
Okay, what do you think?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem. I don't need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.
Sheldon, your food's getting cold. What are you doing?
Wait. What's wrong with geology?
Let me put this in a way you'll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren't real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.
Have you considered studying standard model physics?
Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
What about loop quantum gravity?
Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don't you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
How does that happen?
Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?
Come on, let's get you to bed. You've had a lot to drink.
That's what I'm saying.

How you feeling?
Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
I don't know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
What?
You're awful quiet. Everything okay?
Ugh. Me, too. What happened?
I wouldn't worry about it. He's got a pretty good sense of humour.
Oh, well, turns out I'd already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.
Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.
Next message.
Next message.
Next message.
Next message.
Next message.
Next message.
Oh, and there's not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.
Sure. What's up?
Huh, well, I think there's some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.
Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?
Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?
Great, what do you want to do?

What can we do that's free?
Are you kidding? That's what you always do. Think harder.
You know what? Why don't we just ease into this. Let, let's go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.
No.
No. Bernadette's working late.
Aw. What's wrong with her?
That's not what I meant.

Yep.
Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?
What the hell? What? She's not working late.
Why would they lie to us?
You're not working late. Why did you lie to me?
Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.
We're gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you're gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I'm gonna complain about my movie, and we're gonna support each other because that's what friends do.
What's wrong?
It's fusion.
Think I've been complaining too much about the movie?
Thank you.
Hey, I don't understand why you're not upset with Amy.
Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.
Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.
Fine, I'll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that's a good one.
How is that not good?
Uh, since you're paying for dinner, I'll let that slide. Open yours.
Not with money. Read.
Oh, I think I see our next stop.
No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.

All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.
Oh, for God's sake. Look, he's a physicist who's trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.
All right, why don't we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there's a woman in your life you're having problems with.
Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.
Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.

Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.

Uh, well, it's not May the fifth, and it's not May the third. It's May the fourth.

Hey, you got a second?
Sheldon, I've got some bad news.
I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
Sorry, buddy.
Anyway, the, the funeral's on Sunday.
Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.
Watching your old friend?
Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
Why not?
Are you sure you don't want to go say good-bye?
And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you've seen hundreds of times isn't?
Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?
You're being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
Sweetie, are you sure you don't want to come with us to the funeral?
No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?

Since we all agree Episode I isn't our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.
Okay, so you'd lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.
It was just a suggestion.
You never heard it that time.
I am. Oh, it, it's fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I've gone without running into a men's room in, in, in years.
I don't know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.
I'm, I'm not, I'm not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?
Well, that, that clears that up.
Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.
Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?
Where, where, where are we?
Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.
Um, always, get, get a prenup.
Well, why, why do you think I'm here?
Is, is this the, the first time you've lost, you know, someone close to you?
Yeah, I've, I've outlived a few of my doctors, too.
I'm, I'm sorry about that.
Well, you know, it's, it's okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.
Hey, buddy. Heard you're having a rough day. You all right?
It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur's son is a high school sci…?  Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?
Sheldon, that, that'll take us all night.
Happy Star Wars Day.

Yeah, apparently, um, I'm here whenever, when, whenever you need me.
May, maybe for you.
Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you're, you're dreaming you're watching Star Wars.
I mean, don't, don't you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you're spending your limited time on Earth?
Should we do something for her?
Sheldon, we're talking about your friend's mother. She got hurt.
I don't know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler's List is tough to beat.
It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.

Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren't you gonna get 3-D glasses?
Is that a real thing?
Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.
Yeah, okay.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn't sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.
You don't have to make me anything.
Sorry, I left them in my turban.
Wouldn't you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
But you don't have sex with her, either.
To be truthful, Emily and I haven't dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.
No.
I don't understand it. I'm a nice guy, I have a great job, I'm well-educated, come from a good family. Why don't women want to be with me?
What? Don't send me home. I can't be alone right now.
What do you mean?
Eleven.
Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
I'll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
Maybe. I, I don't know.It's late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you're saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.
She's just so impossible, they keep quitting.
Hey, buddy.
You okay?
Why?
That's a rude thing to say, out loud.
Whatever you do, just don't make any rash decisions.
What you working on?
Oh. How's it going?
It's nice that you called them esteemed.
So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.
Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.
I'm not.
Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.
Well, well, we might want to live together.
That's very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.
I don't know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I'll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I'll take this place, and you can move across the hall.
No, I did not.
No.
Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.
Well, yeah.

They just don't appreciate you.
Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.
You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you're always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you're not there.
You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
See? Maybe you'll love living alone.
And if it turns out you don't, you and I could live together.
Sheldon, it was just a thought.
It tastes the same.

Hey, Sheldon.
I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.
I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.
Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear back from the insurance company.
I don't mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.
Well, sorry I let you down.
That'll be $2.99.
Fine, a dollar.
No, I only have hundreds.
Sheldon.
Yeah.
We were worried about you.
Seriously? You don't even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
Okay, I know you're upset and there's a lot of stuff going on, but it's nothing we can't work out. Come on, let's get you home.
And go where?
So a few things don't go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I'll, I'll take you to Legoland.
Then what can I do?
He'll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.
Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I'm not gonna stand in your way.
Be safe and call us.
Bye, buddy. Sheldon?
I'm gonna miss you.

I don't think so.
Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I'll have the strength to tell you how much I won't be doing that.  Hello?
Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.
I'd love to. I'm just about to do yoga with Penny.
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Okay.
Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?

Not yet.
Nope.

We're doing everything we can.
Sheldon.
What do you mean, why did I come? You're my boyfriend. I haven't seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don't you have anything to say besides why did you come?
Fine. Whisper it.
So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where'd you go?
How were they?
I'm sorry, so you never went outside?

I don't care.
Have you not noticed that I've been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
I'm mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?
We're in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?
What's the big deal?
Just tell her.
You were worried about that?
Sure.

Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?
But you did do it. So what if it didn't all go your way? That's what makes it an adventure.
See? This trip was good for you.
Butterfly could've gotten himself home from Arizona.
Hey, look who's back.

I thought your phone got stolen.
And you thought they all had a silver lining.
I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.

Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.
But half-man, half-owl could fly…
I said I'll get to it.
Yes.
Mm, I don't know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher's pet?

Dr. Cooper.
Yes. Uh, welcome back.
You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.
Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.
Currently, you're being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you'll be able to choose whatever field of research you'd like.
That is correct.
Yes.
Hey, how'd it go with human resources?
I don't understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?
The kids are gonna love him.
This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they're wrong.
You enjoy giving people grades.
And you love the sound of your own voice.
Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.
Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?
Did you send everyone to the principal's office already?
Well, that's not your fault.
Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.
Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?
Hey, what if I took your class?
I'm thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?
I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.
I'd use Feynman's trick, differentiate under the integral sign.
Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I'll say that. Now do you think I'm smart enough?
Oh, come on. You might've gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.
So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I'm talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.
Because it's taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I'm in the centre now, and I love that even more.
But I'm just…
Hmm. You're up late.
Sheldon, why are you doing this?
No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz?
You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can't deal with it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you're gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I'm out. But if you're interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I'm willing to give this a shot.
Okay.
That's where I'm a little fuzzy.
All I do is win, win, win no matter what.
Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!
If you're gonna be a crappy teacher, then I'm gonna be a crappy student.  Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. 'cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now…
Okay.
Making a straw.
So I can shoot you with a spitball.
You mean, like, where she's nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.

Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.
You reported me to human resources?
Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you're happy.
I'm smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I'm not familiar with doesn't prove anything. I could do the same to you.
Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?
Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?
That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don't know, do you? What's the matter, smart guy? Don't know Poiseuille's law?
Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.
I'm heckling you. It's a beloved part of baseball.
That's so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.

No, and neither did our waiter.
Hey, how was dinner?
You guys are going out two nights in a row?
It's better than hot, it's binding.
You are aware that a double date doesn't count as two dates.
Sheldon, I'm surprised you'd choose to go to a pub.
I then suggested a pub.
You don't even like Yorkshire pudding.
Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
Isn't this when he says bazooka or something?
You don't honestly think that, do you?
Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn't?
Yeah, toddlers do that.
So what? Why do you even care?
Whatever. You can't even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
Uh, we're not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.
Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
Some perfect couple. He won't even share his food with her.
I'm not jealous. I just think it's silly for you to compare relationships like they're something that can be quantified.
Sheldon, you're just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.
Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.
They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.
So, this is accurate?
Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.
No, we're sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.
I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we're a bad couple.
Because it doesn't matter. I don't care if we're a ten or a two.
It would make me so happy if you said things like that.
This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.
Sheldon, what did you expect?
I'll tell you what. If we stay, I'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.
Does it matter?
‘Cause I'm an idiot who didn't think this through.
You suck, Wolowitz!
Have you guys heard about this research team that's trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
Hey.
Yeah. I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
Since when do you read social science?
Hey, guys.
Uh, yeah, I'm a resident at Huntington Hospital.
Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

You know, he might not reopen. He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.
All I know is, he's got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?
Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.

Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?
Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?
Great.
You, okay? It's you. You're, you're next.

We'll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
You say things like that all the time.
Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?
Why?
Will you stay out of this?
Yeah, and I'm not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.
Why are you even part of this conversation? You don't know anything about women.
He's right.

Of course.
I'm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.
Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?
Then I think it's a terrific idea.
I know. I was looking forward to it.
And snacks.
Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.
That's not what happened.
No one wants to hear it.
Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea.
I think someone owes me an apology.
You admit Amy's a distraction?
My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
Then we'll go to a hotel.
We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
You would go to a beach house?
For your information, Emily is working tonight.
Okay, let's focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let's change the world.
Oh. I never saw that.
Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let's change the world to let's watch TV.
I, I think I still have it.
Also mine.
You know, let's just come up with something new.
How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
Oh, I have an idea.
This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.
What do you mean?
Had will have placed?
Okay, so, it wasn't until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That's when he altered the timeline.
What?
Wait. Is brought right?
I don't know. You did it to me.
Guys.
Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.
All right.
Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.
I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny. Can we get back to work?
Like behavior modification?
We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
If only we had one.
All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…
I think it'll be pretty clear. If not, we'll take a vote. Oh, and also…
We didn't have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we're leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?
Thank you. And now I owe you one.
Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn't working.
Negative reinforcement is really wrong?
No.
It's late. We've wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?
So you're, you're saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?
Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?
Oh. What's going on?
Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?
You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.
Yup.
Hey, Sheldon, you busy?
Don't they lay eggs on a rock?
So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it's very humid, and about a hundred degrees.
It's also a live mine, so there'll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.
Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.
Well, there's no toilets, we'll have to do our business in a bucket.
Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.
Exactly.
So where should we do it?
Uh, Sheldon…
No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.
This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.
Sheldon, I'm really impressed you're willing to try this.
I'm sweating already.
How hot is it?
Well, that's what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.
How you feeling?
Let's set up the equipment. It'll help take your mind off of it.
Do you know any mining songs?
That's pretty.
It's a little more bleak than I thought.
Getting kind of grim.
Okay. How 'bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don't have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.
You guys doing okay down there?
You guys doing okay down there?
I'm going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?
We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
What if we brought them down with us?
Anything else?
Oh, this heat is brutal.
Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let's get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.
Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.
You don't have to bite my head off.
If you would just use the bucket, you'd be so much more comfortable.
Sheldon, you know what I think of when I'm scared? Voyager.
The space probe.
Do you really need me to transcribe this?
Thank you.
I'm not a delivery man, I'm a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.
All right.
All right.
All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.
I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.
Great timing, food just got here.
Yes.
Yes.
No, but you can have mine.
What? Why didn't you say that first?
Oh, uh, you probably don't want her to see this. It's unnecessarily graphic.
He tried to score with Penny.

Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn't really get serious until William Shatner's bladder infection.
Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.
Ah, that's a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.
I'll be right back.
Oh, my God.
Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.
No, because I liked it.
So, I've noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.
So, you think she'll be single soon?
Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.
What?
Uh, guys, we're locked in here.

Fine, it bothers me. You happy?
How is this helpful?
But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as. It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.
Did you go to your prom?

You knocked more than usual.
Okay, what's up?
Great, how?
Okay, just one question. What?
Here's a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?
Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.
You're kidding.
You know, if you're not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.
Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.
There, perfect.
I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
Was that a flask?
You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?
If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?
And while you're at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn't mean you have to.
You know, 'cause, 'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.
Sheldon, you look so handsome.
Oh, it's a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you're dancing.
Where are you going?
Sheldon, can I come in?
Why not?
You're making me worry. What's going on?
What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
Sheldon, this is silly. I'm not missing another prom. I'm going upstairs now. Good-bye.
You did?
Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.
I'm always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.
Of course I understand. Sheldon, there's something else I've been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don't have to say it back. I know you're not ready, and I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictates…
You said it.
Okay.
This is an easy one. You love this guy.
Come on, he's an under-appreciated genius.
It's not you. Now think, there's a car named after him.
How about this, he's a poor man's Sheldon Cooper.
Hello.
Yeah. It's a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He's gonna do it next week.
Yeah, back off, he's all mine.
Sheldon, it's a routine procedure, I've heard you complain about his snoring.
Thank you.
Okay.
I think you could give a better clue.
Okay, why?
If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?
What's your problem?
It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.
I told you, there's nothing to worry about.
Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don't die?
Hey. What're you working on?
Yeah?
Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.
I'm not allergic to latex.
For the same reason I don't wear the apron or the hair net.
Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?
Buddy, I, I get that you're worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I'm not going to die.
Well, I do know that it won't be from an asteroid strike.
If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn't you die, too?
Tell you what, the surgery's not for a week, I'll think about it.

Don't worry about that. I'm happy to take you to work.
It's nice they're getting exercise.
I'm sure he brought it.
He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it.
I'm odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.
Twenty eight.
Fifty six.
All right. Don't get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he's getting the surgery right now.
Fine. It's sweet that you care about him so much.

We had a really nice swim.
‘Cause I'm a liar, liar?
He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.
He's still in surgery.
Come on, let's talk about something other than the surgery.
I think she meant something a little happier.
Oh, it's nice you got him that.
Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
Who told you to keep going around?
Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you're thinking, just keep it to yourself.
And I'm sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.
Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.
Really? You won't even say A?
Obviously, I care about Leonard. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with him.
Sheldon, you can't go back there.
Are you okay?
Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.
How is it my fault?
Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn't even want you there.
Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.
Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.
You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.
Oh, what'd you get?
Okay, that's morbid. Send it back.
Hey, why did you get two? I'm with stupid.

I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.
After only 232 episodes.
You said you weren't gonna bring that up.
That was a good one.

And, yes, even shed a tear or two.
Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?
Then who did sew it, hmm?
Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.
Action.
Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.
While?
Great. Happy to be back.
Oh, hell, no.

Take that, glass ceiling.
Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.
Hey.
Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career, and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.
Sad?
Yeah. What did they say?
Sheldon, that wasn't for you.

Ugh. What are you doing here?
Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don't know why I didn't get a gate.
Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.
I've always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.
You're going.
I don't hate you. I love you.
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.
Maybe you'd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.
She's just excited about the holidays.
How?
What?
Yeah, you're gonna have to walk me through that.
Then you're both sad?
So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
What about that sweater?
I think the nicest gifts I've got from Howie show how well he knows me.
Wow, you really do love her.
All right, let me see if I've got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?
Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.
Thank you. And it's figs.
Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you're good.
I thought you hate giving gifts.
You got me something?
Look at you on Santa's lap. That's so sweet.
No, I love it.
Actually, I did get you something.
Well, you got me something. Here.
They're your Meemaw's Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
Merry Christmas, Sheldon.

Well, I'd like to be green, but you know you always take it.
Blue and yellow make green.
Hi. Ready to go?
Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.
I don't want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
No. We're always doing what you guys want. Just once, it'd be nice if you did something we wanted.
Sheldon?
Thank you.
You were, but somehow I held myself back.
Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?
Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.
Ah, interesting, we're being accused of making you do things you don't like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.
That's what I was doing.
All right, keep thinking.
Well, yeah.
It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.
This isn't so bad.
You guys comfy? This might take a while.
No, you're right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.
Uh, I've got some bad news. There's no cell service in here.
That's true.
Sheldon, it's fine.

Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.
I don't know, but the girls do a lot for us. It's the least we can do.
Look at you, being all mature.
I, I'm sorry? You make compromises for me?
On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we're living?
That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
What? Then. then why don't you do it?

Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
Because of you, I'm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I'm not allowed to whistle. I don't wear shoes that might squeak.
Yes, it's true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.
You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It's exhausting.
Sheldon, I, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.
Do you mean that?
Come on, don't get upset.
Sheldon.
I'm not leaving your world. I'm just talking about living across the hall.
Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.
Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard's not gonna move out until you're ready.
All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?
Okay.
You got it.
Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.
Yeah, it looks great.
Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.
Okay, we're headed out, see you later.
Yeah, sure.
Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her… and that's why you're the best roommate ever.
So what do you need the headphones for?
Yeah, have fun.
Bye.
Hey, we're home. Any progress?
Ah, you're upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn't make a breakthrough, and now you're worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you're gonna sit around and sulk all day?
Call me if you need anything.
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Ugh, what?
Oh, I'm just doing this awful workout. I hate it.
I don't know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.
The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
Uh, you're sad about not getting anything done last night, so you're gonna sit around and pout about it?
Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.
What do you mean?
Hold on. What's in it for us?

33 seconds. Okay, that'll be our baseline.
It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
All right, next, we're gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.
Ready? Begin. Why'd you pop it?
Look, I know you don't like it, but that's the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.
My mother said that's how good girls do it.
Sheldon, you're a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I'm sure you'll find the breakthrough you've been looking for.
And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?
Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.
Because you're happy they're elevated.
That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.
So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
And you think that's going to help?
Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.
Howard's right, that'll never work.
I don't think that's what you want at all.
Because it is what you want, and it's not what you said.
Yes, we can.
Nah.
Really? Want to go to Hawaii?
Come in.
What's up?
What exactly do you think goes on here?
We were talking about Penny's job.
Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.
Well, they're not a hundred percent wolf. They're a werewolf, that's only part wolf. It's like comparing apples to oranges.
What is going on?
Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I'm trying to sleep. Good night.
You've been working so much lately, I'm glad you didn't forget about date night.
Sheldon.
Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
Fine. How was your day?
Sheldon. Sheldon, I'm worried about you. You're not eating, you haven't slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.
You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.
I'm sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.
Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.
You don't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
That's not true.
Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.
Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.
It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I'm telling you for the last time, take the cap off.

Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?
Here we are.
You lie down, he'll be here in a minute.
Now, you just get comfortable.
Yeah, you get some sleep.
You're right, we can't.
Little ball of fur.
You look like you got some rest.
Yeah, no problem.
Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?
What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?
I know this isn't my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?
No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?
You do? You're not messing with me?
You're giving me a sticker?
You're still awake?
You worked out all the math.
You wrote a paper on my idea?
When did my idea become our idea?
This is good. Our idea is really good.
You know, if no one's thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.
Wow, it's all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?
You're sure it's good?
Okay, partner, let's do it.
Well, we did it.
Is your tongue blue?
Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.
No.
Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?
Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.
Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.
It's anonymous, and user name General Relativity.
Uh, don't lower yourself to their level.
Sheldon, my name's on that paper, too. There's no upside to doing this.
Upon review, I've changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it's inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.
Do it.
Did he respond yet?
Read it back one more time.
And you don't think that's too rough?

Do you really want him to write back?
No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li'l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
Guys, this person's just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.
See? Better with the accent.
What did you write?
What does that mean?
Come on, Sheldon!
Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they'd never say to your face.
You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people's work.
All right, do it. Call him. Let's find out what this loser's ever accomplished.
Well, hello there.
I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.
Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.

Sure.
How many?
Hey, sowwy to intewupt.
Did you know Edison didn't actuawy invent the wight bulb?
Well, that's fascinating. I can't wait to read it.
Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.
I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.
Sheldon, we're all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You're being petty.
Hey.
You okay?
What's going on?
Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?
Oh, that sounds like a good thing.
I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.
Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose. Besides, aren't you the one who says there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?
All right, well, if I'm understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.
I don't know what to tell you. I mean, why don't you talk to her?
Well, you could shove them somewhere.

No.
I don't know, just think about something else.
Sure.
Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.
Now imagine you're holding that pen.
Now open your hand and let it go.
Sheldon, this isn't that hard.
How?
What? She didn't give me any puzzles.
Son of a bitch.
I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp.
Why would she even do this?
Make this interesting? You bet money on me?
It's not interesting. It's incredibly insulting.
Oh, my, that's it. Get out.
Get out.
What?
Sheldon, open the door.
I just saw you.
Really? You couldn't get it out?
That's not true.
Can you please just let it go?
I don't know.
Not right now, Sheldon.
No, it's okay. What?
Don't take this away from me.
If you want, I can yell at you later.
Oh, careful. You're poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.
No.
Forget it.
Why don't you just do the test?
What? You're okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
That's what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.

You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.

Yup. Be right there. I assume you don't want wine.
What heavy machinery? Let's just start.
Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?
Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.
You sure that's your choice? ‘Cause I've had that dinner.
Robert Downey, Jr.

Yeah, why?
He's there.
Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What's yours?
Interesting, you didn't mention Amy.

Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.
Come on, I'm just having some fun with you.
Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.
Well, I can't read people's minds. Actually, that's not true, I can read men's minds, but only 'cause it's usually the one thing.
You're all alike.
Really? You always seem so confident.
Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.
Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.
If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?
Today's your birthday?
Well, that's always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.
So, why did you finally tell me?
Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won't tell anyone.
That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.

All that's left to do is stare into each other's eyes for four minutes without talking.
You ready?
And begin. This is kind of creepy.
Sorry.
Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.
Aw, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.
I meant more like a little brother.
It's getting creepy again.
Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.
Can you believe it's been eight years?
I can't remember a time you guys weren't in my life.
That's it. That wasn't so bad.
Well, maybe. But I'm still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.
Like what?

I just want to make sure you get there safe.
SURPRISE!
Hi.
Okay.
Okay.
This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
Yes.
Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
Why a turtle?
For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.

It's okay. You made it. We're fine.
Let's forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?
Well, he's barely moving. He looks half dead.
But that's not your fault. Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow. You'll stay with me when he's at Comic-Con or away for work.
What are you talking about?
You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn't be bothered to tell me?
Of course not.

No one told you to poke the turtle's face.
I'm surprised you even care if he likes you, since you're planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.
Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.
I would at least mention it before filling out the application.
And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.
You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.
No. Forget it.
Please don't.

Why do you even want to do this?
Can't you just tell me?
You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
I don't get it. There's actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it's my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.
I think I'm gonna go home.
You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.
Sure. Unless something better comes along.
What I want is for us to be planning our future together.
We're on the same planet.
Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.
Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.
I guess we'll have to make a new video together, as a couple.

I'd say I'm sorry I asked, except I didn't.
Oh, let me see.
Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all.
It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?
Poor Leonard.
Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard's team?
So you see what I'm getting at?
No.
Try again.
Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He's going to feel bad.
Remember that time you didn't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
Exactly.

Yeah.
Actually, your name is on the electric bill.
I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.
What's going on?
Did they hate it?
So what's the problem?
Sheldon.
Really?
Uh, that, that's not necessary.
Cooper and his team?
Uh, at least they're talking about the theory. I mean, that's what's important.
That's not helping.
Baby's listening.
What?
What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
Thank you. What did he say?
You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.
If you're trying to make me feel better, it's not working.
No.

Well, that is an important part.
But Leonard's idea was good.

It's not your fault.
Not your fault.
And there goes the mood.
Subtle.
Fine.
All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.
Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.
Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.
Oh, that's fine.
Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.
Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.
You're being ridiculous.
Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I'd go to my real salon.
Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.
And girls.
So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!
It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.
Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up.
Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?

Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.
Are you all set for your trip?
Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.

If it's half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I'm in.
That soy Frappuccino I had.
I don't know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?
We haven't been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.
No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That's pretty cool.
What? This road trip just got crazy.
I'm surprised you know that reference.
Yes.
Sure.
It could be.
Exactly.
Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.
I doubt it.
If we do, we'll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?
Oh, that's true. It's not like we can get in there.
I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.
I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it.

Wasn't even that hard to find.
I know. You want to get a picture?
Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.
No, but I don't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.
Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I'm a little nervous.
Right.

We're trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.
Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.
Well, what's your plan?
Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth.
Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can't let you in.
Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best… What are you doing?
Copy.

I don't know. Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.
Uh-huh, I'm normally very nice, but you shut up, too.
Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.
Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.
No, you're not going anywhere, kissy face. Let's go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.

Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.
The glass is empty, Sheldon. It's completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?
Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.
That part was pretty good.
You did flop around a lot.
You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.
I know.
I guess this could count as an adventure.
I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?
Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
Yeah, I bet you anything it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.
Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.
Can you please pass the salt?
Is this how the rest of the night's going to be?
No, Sheldon.
According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we're not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.
Well, it applies to you, too.

Probably not. It's an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.
And at the same time, not.
You know, there's nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.
More juvenile than this?
How's it going, Sheldon?
Can I come in?
Amazing.
What are we doing? This is a fort. Let's sit on the floor.

I'd say, Knox over Ticonderoga, 'cause it's got the gold.
And McBlanket over Sumter 'cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o'clock. Date night's over.
We both know this one's gonna win.
Come on, I'll help you take this down.
Well, as long as we're suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.
It's a big fort.
PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
You got yourself a sleepover.
Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
Hello? What is this?
Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I'm gonna go to sleep.
Yeah, I'm good.
Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?
Okay, have a seat on the floor.

Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.
Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.
That's pretty cool, Sheldon.
Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.
Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.
Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?
Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.
Sheldon.  Sheldon.  Sheldon.
Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.
Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.
No, no. It's about my acting career.
Well.
Okay, look, here's the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it's going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.
Well, why?
You're really not gonna tell me?

Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.
If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?
No.
Oh. You're right. I'm worried about something that hasn't even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
Oh, I guess you're right. Maybe it is the person who asks.
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?
‘Cause I already know what he'll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it.

Hang on. Not that your song isn't terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?
Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?
We want you back on the project with us.
Great. Now that we're all on the same page, let's get together tonight and work on it.
Okay, I think we should do it right now.
So, I'd like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.
Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.
I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.
Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.
The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
Squeeze yourself.
Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?
What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba's head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.
You know what? You're right. I should have asked you.
Okay, and if we're talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.
Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
Sheldon, you're not in charge. Raj is in charge.
He's right. If you think about it, we're all in charge.

Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.
Nope. It's pretty exciting.
How would I be blinded?
I'll take my chances.
Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera's on, they're both on the same network. We should be getting an image.
Maybe we should recalibrate it.
Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.
Yeah.
Sheldon.
Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.
No red and yellow, no red and yellow.
It's green.
Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.
Oh. All right, playtime's over. Let's open this baby up.
Boy, oh, boy, that's a lot of pieces.
Yes, of course.
Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?
That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.
I'm an MIT-trained engineer. I've built components for the space station.
Hey.
I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?
No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.
What?
Okay, I think I've narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.
One toy at a time.
Suicide.
It's not about the money. It's about solving a problem. It's why I became an engineer. It's what I like to do, it's what I'm trained to do. It's who I am.
Hey.
Ha-ha.
All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we're back in business. Let's just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?
Battery charged?
Four, three, two, one.
What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.
Well, I'm not flying it.
I don't know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.
Tech Support, can I help you?
Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I…
It's so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
Uh, I don't know. They're pretty different.
Shelly, I'm so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.
I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.
Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.
The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.
Hey, look who's here.
Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.
That's so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.
Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he's terrific.
Calm down, dear. Mary, I'm curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?
Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.
Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn't think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.
Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.
Oh, he was a handful.

You don't look very happy.
Shelly does not like change.
Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.
We did not. That's not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
It came from Tiffany's.
Really doesn't matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
Yes, and we'll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.
Yes, you are a super weaner.
Yeah, you're right. That is the term I'm looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.
Why don't we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.
I'm terribly sorry that I upset your mother.
I can't help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.
But look how well you turned out.
I suppose.
Do you suppose you would've flourished more in a reward-based environment?
Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there's more than one way to raise a child.
Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?
That's what you're thinking about?
Are any of them me?
What are you doing?
I didn't kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.
Really? That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?
Oh, sure, I'd love to.
Hey.
Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.
Mmm. So what do you need help with?
Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
That's probably it. What'd you say to her?
And that made her angry?
Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.
I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.
Okay, see, that's even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.
Still haven't heard from her?
Hey, I don't think she's wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.
Yeah, you've been going out for years. You haven't even slept together.
Uh, hello.
No. Sheldon, we're getting married.
Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.
We're gonna set a date.
You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.
Not in a rush, busy with work…
It's not just the date. We haven't talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?
Fine. I want to release butterflies.
Great.

Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff.
Uh, Sheldon, I think we're good for now.
Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We're committed to each other. We're happy. A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.
Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.
Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.
I'm in. Let's do it.
Thanks.
Hello.
I've been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I've been incredibly patient for years.
Okay, well, this isn't easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.
I hope you understand.
Bye, Sheldon.
Aw. That's exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.
No. Why?
Why not?
What happened now?
She did?
No.
Buddy, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you're going through this with Amy doesn't mean that all women are bad.
Amy, don't be like that.
Penny's on the phone with her.
She's upset. Look, it's gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.
No, I think it's because we're eloping.

Oh. What are you doing here?
Well, it's only been 11 hours.
Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk, I'll let you know.
Sure.
We're not back together.
If you must know, I'm going to Howard and Bernadette's to watch the wedding.
There's no guy.
I'm not gonna be alone. I'll be with my friends.
Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
For God's sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?
Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.

Didn't even crack the top ten.
I'm sure you guys will figure something out.
Sheldon, shh. The wedding's starting.
No, we totally won.
It's because you're not giving me any space to think.
Amy.

Shelly! How's my baby doing?
Oh, what's going on?
Oh, Shelly.
Well, let's not be hasty. Are you sure it's over for good?
You want to tell me what happened?
Good chance.
Well, honey, don't send it back yet. Your sister's married, and I'm not letting your brother give my grandmother's ring to that whore he's dating.
Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.
I'm not glowing. I'm upset.

What's this?
Oh. That's so sweet of you.
I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.
You know, it's bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.
Some girl named Mandy.
Yeah.
That's great.
That's ridiculous.
I'm with Leonard.
Right? I can't believe Amy actually went through with it.
I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
Okay, look, it's not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.
Sheldon.
Sure.

Sure, let's make it an even hundred.
I wouldn't.
Well, I may be a man, but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.
I figured that out.
Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.

How am I supposed to sleep? I've been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn't speaking to me.
You can't be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you're gonna do the same with a random guy?
What is happening?
Sheldon, I don't think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.
What do you want?
What baby?
I'm hanging up.
Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.
Because we're broken up.
No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.
Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it's hard. It's hard for me, too. But I've seen and talked to you more in the two days we've been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.
What are you doing here?
And you didn't do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.
Just give me the box.
Fine. My old scarf.
You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?
Whose bra is this?
It's Penny's.
Good-bye.
If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.
Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?
Okay, when I'm done with him, I'm gonna need more information.
Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you're gonna go to work and see this woman?
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
What? Why?
Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.
I'm not being weird. Am I being weird?
Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.


I'm gonna kill him.
Sheldon, I can't believe you got us a wedding gift.
What is this?
That's so great.
We?
How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?
I don't know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.
I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.

Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?
Yeah.
Well, you eloped and we didn't get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there's a van downstairs and we're here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.
Wow, okay.


Well, Sheldon, there's something about this van that you're going to find very interesting.
This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.
I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
Fun, I've never been there.
What's wrong with Mexico?
Okay, calm down. There's a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman's van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.

We don't have any of those.
If there was a hidden compartment, don't you think you'd be stuffed in it by now?
You don't need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.
Sheldon, can you believe that we're driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It's like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn't cool.
Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.
Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.
I think it's a tyre.
It's the tyre.
What?
Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.
Let's see, a lever, a lever.
No, it's too broad of a beam. You'd need something more precise, like Superman's heat vision.
If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?
Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn't a perfectly reasonable choice, but we're scientists. Don't you think we can figure this out using actual science?
We will, we will percussive shock you.
They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let's hope the lug nut expands.
We have plenty of food for the animals.
Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.
Scientific Principle: Accelerated Corrosion.
It's burning salsa. I'm hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
Scientific Principle: Exothermic Reaction.
If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy's ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.

Oh, we're glad you had fun.
I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie. You're a young man.
It's just where I need them. You know, she doesn't have a lot of closet space.
Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.
Come on, buddy.
Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.

Of course.
Aw. I'm honoured.
How can I help you?
Well, why don't you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.
Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?

Do I really have to do that now?
It's harder than I thought.

Sure.
Is that supposed to be a joke?
I'm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.
I'm sure you'll find somebody else.
I don't know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.
I don't think that was the point of the movie.
Hey, we're going to dinner. You want to come?
Hang on. Wait, you actually think it's 2003?

Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?
I know what you're doing. You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you, but it's not happening.
Will you knock it off? We're across the hall.
They're not saying that.
Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.
Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.
Okay, look, we don't need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we'll sleep over there, and sometimes we'll sleep over here.
Well, it's not forever. It's just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he's our dog.
Fine.
Oh, one sec.
The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.
Are you?
Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.
I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that's not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what's the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.
It's indoors, so no sunscreen.
No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
Preach.
What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you're not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.
Awwight. Let's begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.
What's wong, Cooper?
When you're in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?
Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.
Yes.
In fencing, we don't call it a stab. We call it a touch.
Look at us. We're like the Rockettes.
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
What?
When was your honour insulted?
My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.
What's going on with Amy?
Weawwy? Good to know.
Oh, buddy, I get that you don't like it, but it's not really up to you.
Look, even if it's not him, Amy's probably going to date someone at some point.
Of course. She deserves to be happy.
Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn't a good idea.
And now the crazy version of what I just said.
And how are you gonna do that?
You've had one wesson. I'll destwoy you.
I'm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.
Why? You never thought you'd end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there's someone else out there for you.
Maybe you should consider women who aren't in serious relationships with your closest friends?
Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn't work.
Oh, boy.
I don't know what that means.
I'm married, and I'm her grandmother.

You're just sweaty from exercise.
Hello.
Yeah.
How have you been?
How'd that go?
Well, actually, he, he already did.
I said no.
I didn't know you were interested in dating.
Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it's nice to see you. You look good.

What's going on?
Just tell me.
Oh, well, that kind of stinks.
What are we going to do?
I'd love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment's on back order for a month.
That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
Sowwy, there's a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Hell no.
Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.
Maybe he's not for you.
Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.
He's got what we need and can meet us tonight.
The man restocking the cereal shelves.
He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.
Do you want liquid helium or not?
Then I'm going to tell him we're in.
We're just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we're going to spend it on the helium we need. It's not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.
Sure. So, are we doing this?
Remember? Don't ask too many questions?
A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.
Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.
That must be him.
Uh, I'm Leonard. This is my friend…
Uh, yeah, uh, right here.
What ya doing, Skippy?
Oh, how do I know you're not gonna drive away without paying me?
Look, you can trust us. We're respected scientists.
Yeah, well, from my perspective, that's how you two appear to me.
Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.
Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.
Hmm, I don't follow.
Is that a threat?
Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I'll report you, then I'll pound your asses into the ground.
Afraid so, Skippy.
Really? What's the hypothesis?
Okay, but now there's this Swedish team that read our paper and they're trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.
Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there's, uh, plenty we could do about it.

Will you stop with that already?
And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?
Let's just start the experiment.
We're not getting caught.
The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.
What?
What is it?
It's probably USC or UCLA.
Let's not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.
Yeah, well, normally I wouldn't, but my daughter's having a sleepover, and there's only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.
No, nothing. We just changed our mind.
But you ain't getting your money back.
No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.
He wants more money.
That's exactly how much it is.

Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?
But you have to add my name to your paper.
Take your time. I'll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.
It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
They should've used among, right?
All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?
You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.
Why is he writing to you?
Oh. Hey, high five.
Yes. Don't take your shirt off just because the director said so.

And I'm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.
All right, we're just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera's not here.
Let's start with your name and occupation.
And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?
What was it about Spock that appealed to you?
Do you have any Spock collectibles?
Can we see the napkin?
When did we get a wall safe?
When did we get a floor safe?
There's a security camera?
Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.

Um, doesn't Adam count as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?
Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?
I would.
You have a will?
Oh, what's that ring box?
You bought her a ring?
Sheldon, that's awful.
Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?
Oh, man, I'm sorry, that must have been devastating for you.
I know. It just…
Did you find that helpful?
What about from when you were a kid?
Did it work?
That must have been very upsetting for you.
Oh pfft.
I'm sorry. I'm not here.
I'm just saying, you pretend you don't, but you have feelings just like everybody else.
Sweetie, you're yelling.
Yeah.
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Yeah.
Definitely.
Nirsh.
What are you gonna do?
Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic.
Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.
Thank you.
Oh, I don't want credit for that.
You're in a good mood.
What brought this on?
And you don't want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
Hey, I made French toast sticks.
Ah, I also made oatmeal.

So what's up?
You sure you're up for that? She did hurt you.
Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.
But what are you looking for?
Isn't that a little unreasonable?
And you're afraid it'll do a better job than you?
If you don't want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?
You seriously think women would fight for you?
Well, he's smart, he's a respected scientist.
I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.
This is exciting.
Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
Well, if she can solve them, it'll prove she's intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.
37 minutes left until the deadline.
Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
Maybe you don't want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.
Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
Forty-five.
Thirty seconds.
What?
You thought she was great in X-Men.
Maybe she's waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
Answer it.
Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?
Hi. I'm Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I've never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.
Chija”e'vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.
Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don't need to tell you, there aren't a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.
How could you send her away?
Here are some images of naked grandma butts.
And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.
Hi, Sheldon. What's up?
No one can go with you?
Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you'd be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.
Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it'll be fine.
See you then.
Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?

Hi. Ready for the aquarium?
If that makes you more comfortable.
No. You?
I might go visit my aunt next week.
No, the one in Bakersfield.
Are we done discussing the weather?
I don't know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.

No. It's okay. If we're friends, we should be able to talk about anything.
So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.
Go ahead.
Let's see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven't slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there's a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
I mixed them.
Just one. Are you doing okay?
Good. I want you to be happy.

You're just upset 'cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.
Well, it wouldn't be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.
Sure. What is it?
So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.
It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.
Let's just play.
Hmm. Well, I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.
Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.
But you can pal around with a hagfish?
Isn't that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.
I miss this.
I'm glad you had a nice time with Amy.
Well, I've never been friends with any of my exes.
Hi, Sheldon. I'm just driving home from my mother's.
I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.
It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I'm ready to be your girlfriend again.
We are. But I was hoping, maybe…
Okay. I understand.

Since when do you hum songs?
You were just humming.
How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?
Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
It's just an earworm. It'll come to you.
Is this what we're doing the rest of the night?

Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
I told you if we were patient, he'd figure it out for himself.

Put on some headphones.
Hey, sweetie, why don't you take a break and do something else for a while?
Okay, great. What is it?
I'll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
Who cares?

Hey, can we please get back to work?
All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.
Thank you.

That's a trick question, right?
Yup, she's right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there's an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.
Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.

Do you even like the Beach Boys?
Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?
Why?
Okay, look, I know Amy's like an old lady, but she's not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.
She did soften your life, didn't she?
You know, I'm just being silly. I, I don't know what I'm waiting for.
Sheldon, this, this isn't a good time.
No, it, it, it's okay. Keep going?
I really want that, too.
Kiss her, you brilliant fool.
Guys, tickets already went on sale.
No, it's Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.
What are we gonna do?!
Got 'em.
I'm really happy you and Amy are back together.
I'm also really happy, but I can't pretend it's for you. New Star Wars in three days.
Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy's birthday.
I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.
Oh, great. This again.
Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn't a, a sex dream.
And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What's, what's troubling you?
Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?
And they, they, they don't wear underwear.
Uh, do, do you love this girl?
Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.
Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.
Great.
Sheldon, what's wrong?
Okay.
Obi-what?
Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?
Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.
Hey. We're going to the comic book store. You want to come?
You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.

Come in.
Come in.
Just come in.
We're sorry. What do you need?
Sure.
Wow. You can really arrange that?
How about something a little more realistic?
Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.
Okay, well, what's the third option?
Wild thang.
Sheldon, that's so beautiful.
It, it doesn't seem like it's up to me.
Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers…
Oh, good, good. ‘Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.
What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?
Well, that's, that's very nice of you to say, but I think I'm just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.

Come in.
Hi, Sheldon.
That's okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I'll, I'm gonna go put these in water.
Do you like it?
I can change it back.
So, what'd you have in mind for tonight?
Um, that sounds nice, but I'm not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.
You mean before you give it to me?
Of course.
Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.
Yes.
Hi.
I'm just, um, really nervous.
Well, I've been waiting for this for so long, I've just built it up in my head. I don't know what to expect.
A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away….
Me, too.
Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?
I, I was just curious. How, how'd it go?

It's not the best Best Western I've been to, but I'd say it's the third best Best Western I've been to.
Okay, well, I should unpack.
I will. I wish you were here.
Okay, I'm glad you're not here?
Good-bye, Sheldon.
Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.
Uh, I've got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You're more than welcome to join me.
Oh, if anything, I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.
Well, I should warn you, it's just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.
Oh, not good. Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.
Social anxiety.
Lack of confidence.
Spineless.

Uh, making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.
Still making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.
Now I'm making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
Fine, you want something to do? There's about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don't you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.
Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.
No, you didn't. There are millions of data points there.
Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?
Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we've already collected, we'll know what it is that we found.
It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.
Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…
A medium-sized asteroid.
I kind of like chicken fingers.
Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.
You dream different than me.
So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.
How is that both our names?
Yeah, s-so it's, like, Kooper with a K?
Hey.
Wow, that's amazing. I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.
I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.
Wait, what happened to us?
Well, what are you thinking of naming it?
We haven't settled on anything yet.
So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?
That's just Amy.
Hi, Sheldon. What's up?
Uh, please tell me what to say next.
Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That's so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?
I miss you.
And it's gone.
Good for you.
Glad to hear it.
Yay.
You really don't know why?
Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.
I brought you a little care package from work. It's our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.
I went to medical school.
All right, here you go.
You're not dying. It's just the flu.
Hi, Sheldon.
Why don't you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I'll explain to you why you're wrong.
Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.
Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be unbearable. That's why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it's ended.
No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.
This weekend.
Well, Vegas, but…
That's fine, 'cause actually you're not invited.
Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.
Not this time.
He's coming, too.
Nope.
Oh, great. Do that.
Hi, Sheldon. What's new?
I said what's new, but sure.
Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.
Who else's side could you have been on?
Sheldon, I understand that you're upset because you feel left out, but I don't know why we're even talking about this. Just apologize to them.
Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It's called empathy. It's something you could work on.
Great. Now try it as if this isn't your first day as a person.
Glad I could help.
I feel so, so bad.

Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen, you spoil it in advance.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Appreciate that, too.
You're still not coming.
Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I'm not in a position to just say you can come.
Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it's okay, then yes, you can come.
Well, I hope it's as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.

Wow. I'm impressed.
Forgiven, forgiven.


Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.
What trip to Las Vegas?
Of course, I wasn't invited.

Of course I do.
Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?
No, come on, please don't leave.
Don't worry, you're good.
So, was the fight really bad?
You think they'll still go on the trip?
What is wrong with you?
You went to Emily's to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.
Wait, that's an option? I didn't know that was an option.
That's very mature of you.
Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…
What are you doing?
If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.
Oh, God.
Shh, let him finish.
Thank you.
Oh, it's okay, Sheldon. Come with us.
But I want to stay.
Come on, you pain in the ass.


Yeah.
What is that?
That someone has a name.
I park fine.
Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.

Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
Oh, that's nice. Most people her age don't embrace technology.
Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
Moon Pie.
I'm so happy to see you, too.
Is that nice to say to your friend?

Very. It's nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.
That's great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot. You know, I don't even get to sit there.
Of course.
He's been saying that since he was little. I still don't know what it means.
Oh, now don't you go looking through my suitcase for presents.
Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.
Oh, you better hope so.
Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon's bringing me my whiskey.
She could just eat him up.
Oh, well, you know, now, now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar.
Well, now I know.
Well, maybe I don't like you either.
I think I should leave.
You have an engagement ring?
When did you get an engagement ring?
Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?
Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.
Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don't need your hand-me-downs.
Don't speak to him like he's a child.
Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.
Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?
Uh-oh.
Just get in here.
Go ahead.
Oh, Sheldon, thank you.
I did.
I think what Sheldon means to say is we've both grown together. Isn't that right?
Say yes.
Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.

Hello.
Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.
Not really.
Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.
People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they're around.
What do you mean?
Oh. That is so sweet.
Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we're live.
Consider tonight's episode a Valentine's Day gift for you, our viewers.
Since we're live, you'll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.
I, I think it starts with good communication.
You really think so?
No, Sheldon's right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.
Yeah, I'm just sitting here all by myself wondering if I'w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.
Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?
Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.
Well, I, I wouldn't say right away.
Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don't know if I can do that again.
It really can.
Really?
So do I.
We are young and fun.

It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
Interesting, and when would you use the singular?
Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.
Hey.
That's so amazing.
Why oh, no?
Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.
You're the other baby.
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
And then there's this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Hey, you know what we should do?
Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.
That's just research. We're never gonna make any money from it.
Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
It's true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff. You.
Uh, it's in the corner.
I really do.
It's a good sign.
Damn. What is it?
Can you focus on what we're talking about?
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
I'd enjoy that.
Maybe you're right.
Thank you, Sheldon.
Hi. How are you doing?
So, you gonna get up there later?

I'd like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie.  Havin' my baby, what a lovely way of sayin' how much you love me. Havin' my baby, what a lovely way of sayin' what you're thinkin' of me.
I think we'd make amazing parents.
Way to narrow it down to everything.
Well, your birthday's coming up, and you've never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.
I'll check his room.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?
Can you please just tell me why?
I'm sorry.
Oh, poor thing.
You realize none of those things would happen now?
Yeah.
Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?
All right, what about music?
What kind of cake do you like?

Well, I'm, I'm sure they'll ask you to give a speech, and that's when you just tear 'em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.
Maybe later I'll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.
Oh. Penny says everyone's there. Are you ready?
Are you all right?
Oh, do you need a minute?
Come on, Sheldon, say something.
Happy birthday, Sherman.
Okay, this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?
Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I've clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what's going on?
I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.
Oh, pl, you're not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.
That's fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.
My point is, there was a time I never would've been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I'm happy to do it with you.
What are you wooking at me for? I'm a saint. But a sinner in the sack.
Sheldon, I don't think everyone…
Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we've known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.
And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
Uh, in the past, I would've said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I'm not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it's just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.
Sheldon, we've been together so long, it's hard to remember a time you weren't in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You're more than just my roommate, you're my brother.
Hello, Sheldon.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.
Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?
Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?
So, I've reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we've got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.
That's nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.
Seventy-five percent?
It's university policy.
Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.
Thank you for your time.
We can't. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.
Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.
Of course, we can split any profits three ways.
Okay, great.
Sure, we could write something up.
You can do it, Sheldon.
This contract looks good to me.
Sheldon, did you draft the contract?
So, you're just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?
Excuse us.
What?
Good one.
I hope everything's okay.
Hey.
Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I'm a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.
Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It's, it's with how you treat me.
Are you saying that his contributions aren't as valuable as yours?
How would you enforce it?
And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
I'm on board.

Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.
Yeah.
That's very generous, Sheldon.
I appreciate that.
Sheldon.
I didn't understand your e-mail.
I didn't understand your e-mail.
Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?
Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer? You know that one's out-of-date.
The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
Get a new computer.
Get a new computer.
I got here as quickly as I could.
Sheldon, this is silly.
That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
Look, I'm, I'm sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.
Do what?
Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

Knock it off or I'll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.
Whatch me.
Or you could just look into my eyes.
Well, you know, as long as you're happy.
Oh, but he said you can get store credit.
But why wouldn't…
Okay. How 'bout we change it to why you're being weird about this?
Sheldon, just tell me.
Okay.
All right.
Will you please tell me where we're going?
I'm driving the car. I need to know.
So where are we going?
Why do you have a storage unit?
How long have you had it?
Do you want me to hold that computer?
I'm sorry. What, what am I looking at?
All of it?

You have sporting equipment?
Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?
So, why do you feel you need to save these things?
Okay. I get it. I get it.
I don't.
Why?
It's okay, Sheldon. You know, I've saved a lot of weird things, too.
Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?
So, no one else knows about this?
Thank you for trusting me.
That's me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I'm, I'm here for you.
Baby steps, I guess.
Oh. Okay.
You did it. Do you feel okay?
Well, I'm proud of you.

Well, I feel closer to you now.

I really had to go home for this?
And yet, I'm not.
And yet, you can't.

Whatcha doing?
What am I smelling?
That's not what the forest smells like.
Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
Okay, if that's true, why aren't there more genius squirrels?
Here's your tea.
You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don't we rent a cabin?
We could all go for the weekend. It'll be fun.
Come on, Sheldon, let's go with them.
You know, if that study's real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.
Yes.
Well, we'll be in the woods.
I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it's like Colonial Williamsburg.
Have you ever been off the grid before?
Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.
Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.
And there goes our hike.
They have some board games.
I don't think I've lit a real fire before.
I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?
I've never played that before.
Okay, I'll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
No, it's only if you've done it.
I can't believe you've been arrested.
Sheldon, what did you do?
I'm surprised you would do that.
What, he arrested you for that?
And then you got arrested.
Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend's world in bed.
That's right.
What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?

Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.

But Batman is a man. You're talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That's just Man-Man.
So does that answer your question?

People are coming over, it looked fun.
Your attendance implies it's not.
Oh, Sheldon, we don't need a meeting every three months.
Oh, you know what? I'm not going.
This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
You're the only one who eats them.
I'm not going, you can't make me.
You have fun. I will not be attending.
Thank you.
You're being ridiculous.
Well, I will still come to your meeting.
Because it's important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.

Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.
Yeah, that's right.
And I'd think you'd understand why I'm annoyed.
I don't want to.
Stop saying meeting.
I brought my famous spinach dip.
Oh, he's all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.
Well, I get why he's annoyed.
You love The Simpsons.
Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.
Sorry.
Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.
Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch Game of Thrones over here.
Oh, good, go. You know, it'll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don't get too fond of this character.
Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?
Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.
Two women, huh?
It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
Sheldon.
He's gonna be okay.
Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King's Guard to do her bidding.
That's true.
That was scary.
How come your head has your face on it?

What?
What is it?
Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
‘Cause we're not in it for the stuff. We're in it for the groupies.
But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.
Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.
Well, I'm going. You couldn't stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you're not stopping me now.
Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.
Me? How? Why?
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.
I guess we could give it a try.
Oh, that's great. I've been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.
They know that we're not exclusive, and we just don't ask too many questions.
Who's Frank and Alicia?
Okay. Everything's hooked up. We're ready.
Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.
Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?
Oh, good for you.
No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.
Okay, have fun.
We're leaving now!
Okay, we're leaving, love you, bye.
I brought sparkling cider.
So what do you want to do tonight?
There's more than one?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

I'm sorry, I have to ask.
What is it about trains that you like so much?
That's lovely, Sheldon.

Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
Okay, but just for a little bit.
All right.
You bet.
Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
This is getting fun. What's next?
Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.

Does it have eyes?
I stab it in the middle eye.
Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.
Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.
Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I'm having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.
Well, thanks again.
I might just take you up on that.
Morning.
Ugh. Too much wine.
Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?
Does it bother you?
Who are these people?
Helium.
Yes.
Yes. Pi.
More specific.
Yes.
What are you guys doing?
Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.
Hey, Penny, um, since you're already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?
Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.
Okay.
Or as I know him?
Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.
Uh, I'd say by three.
It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we'll save a spot in line for you.
People do it all the time.
We've waited in a lot of lines together, haven't we?
Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?
Oh, I'm not upset with you, but Amy's pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.
Hey.
Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.
You think it's time you apologize to her yourself?
I'm happy to hold your place till you get back.
Consider it my way of getting more of your money.
Um, it has seat warmers.
Come in.
Fine.
So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?
Hey, how'd it go?
He's just joining his friends; it's fine.
We're near the front of the line. We'll get in either way.
We'd still get in.
Still get in.
We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you over the head with his stick chair.
Oh, please don't.
Oh, uh, I'm with my friends. It's cool.
No.
Uh, who made you line monitor?

The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.
He's got him there. The D even stands for department.
Told you.
I can't believe we're gonna get beat up, and it's not because of your chair.
Okay, you may have to pretend you're black to get us out of here.
Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.
If you're feeling dizzy, it's because the tables have turned.
Buddy, let it go.
You did everything you could.
Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honour?
Okay, wait, you're inviting people to our wedding?
Who's Erno Rubik?
Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?
Thank you for picking me up.
Okay, Mary.
Sheldon, don't be silly.
It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.
I've always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.
Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny's family is coming tomorrow.
Yes, I have.
Good.

Dad, you remember Sheldon.
Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.
You know, the Bible says forgiveness…
Uh, who's hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.
Sheldon.
My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.
Do you realize what's happening here?
Yeah, I'm gonna call Bernadette and see what's keeping them.
Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon's father.
Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
What is happening there?

‘Cause they both turned their phones off.

What?
We're not gonna be brothers. We're not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
No.
Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.
Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you're concerned, you don't know anything, you didn't see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.
Stop it, Sheldon.
I don't see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.
Okay, Beverley, aren't you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.
Well, we can't have that.
Yeah, special, like that.  That's them. Please don't make things any more awkward than they already are.
Morning.
Good.
If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.
You don't know his girlfriend very well.
How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?
Maybe we meet halfway.
No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.
Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom?
This is ridiculous. I'm going across the hall.
That still leaves me here with him.
Who's ready for a wedding?
Oh, so am I.
Sheldon, they haven't done anything wrong. I think it's nice they're hitting it off.
You're a patient young lady.
Okay, I think we're ready.
Not just Leonard and Penny's love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
It's happening.
Good. Thank you.
Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
Sheldon, you're mother's an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.
I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
Don't you be disrespectful to her.

So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard's door. He was terrifying.
He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?
Well, you're kidding, right?
Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.
And my cousin's a lawyer.
You're not a lawyer, Sheldon, you're just a know-it-all.
That's the definition of being a know-it-all.
Give me a second to call my cousin.
Hi.
Well, I don't know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don't sign anything.
That's not what I meant.
That's not what I meant.
Howard, why is he yelling at me?
Someday, when I'm up on murder charges, you'll be hearing from me.

‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people.
Yes.
I'm getting enraged.
It's a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.
Four months?
Hi.
What are you doing?
Does he even like lemon bars?
Something happen at the meeting?
And you talked?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette's mad at me, too.
Why would that make me feel better?
Okay. Never mind.
Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant. She wasn't ready for them to know.
Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.

Wish we weren't so far from my parking space.
I'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
No way.
Sure, I'm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.
What?
We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
Well, wake up, we're gonna put in a lot of late nights.
Well, I don't know, midnight, one.
If you're tired, have some coffee.
Oh, that is so nice.
Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don't think that's happening.
Oh, I'll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don't understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?
Psst, hey, kid.
You look tired. Why don't you have an energy drink? Everyone's doing it.
Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.
All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.
You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.
Here. It's on the house.
Are you okay?
According to the world's worst cuckoo clock, it's two.
Why don't you just go home?
What?
So?
You only had one.
You can't develop a problem that fast.
That's not helpful. It's fun to think about, but it's not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can't do this without you. Can you please pull it together?
Thank you.
No worries.
I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?
Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.
You don't.
No, you don't. But let's say you do. And don't say you do, because you don't. Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?
Your problem.

Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
No.
Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don't have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove 'em wherever you want, I don't care.
Right. Listen to me. We can't do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
Yes, you can.
Seriously?
It's okay, we'll figure something out.
Right. Sorry, sir.
We've hit a bit of a snag. We're already behind schedule.
Yes, thank you so much.
Wanna see a movie?
Mm-hmm. For two of us, it's in the right direction.

What do you think?
Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.
Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?
Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.
So, is that a yes?
Well, where would you go?
Wait. Why don't you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?
That's a good question. Maybe just don't come over.
Okay, it won't be that bad. We wouldn't even sit in your spot while you're gone.
Sheldon, what do you think?
Seriously?
Oh. This is so exciting.
You know, I'm very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.
Mm.
Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.

I don't know. I didn't count.
That's me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?
Well, if you're nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.
Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.
Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don't we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we're more settled in, we can revisit it.
I've never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.
Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.
Thank you.
You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
Shall we?
You guys have fun.
I'm on it. 15 years from now, we'll make guacamole together.
Come on, Sheldon.
Well, that's it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.
Doesn't matter to me. Your choice.
Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.
Well, I'm not refusing. I'm just trying to be considerate.
Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?
Okay, I'll take that side.
Rising rapidly.
Okay. What if we do this?
Great.
Ugh. What is that?  Why did you switch sides?
Comfy?
Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.
Sheldon, I've made more than enough accommodations for you. We're both grown adults, we've been far more intimate than this. If you don't want to snuggle, fine, but we're not building a pillow wall.

Hang on.
Yeah.
Miserable and exhausted.
Well, I didn't, and it's your fault.
Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.
The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
I'm sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?
What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn't know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don't even get that joke, 'cause you don't even work with confounding variables.
Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.
Damn.
Well, for science, maybe I will.
Fine.
Good.
Do you want to go to our place and make out?
I'll give you a hint. We're watching Daredevil.
I told you, you can't regulate every aspect of our lives.
She's right. That's reasonable.
When you live with someone, there's gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating.
Sheldon, what do you say to that?
What?
We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?

Just as challenging?
As you?
Just as challenging as you?
Leonard breathes on me, too. It's not a big deal.
Well, so does Leonard. It's kind of annoying, but it's not the end of the world.
You know, so does Leonard. Can't I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.
You know, one night, Leonard's nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.
Is it? Oh. It's like his sinuses are right here in the car.
Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.
Oh, please, you're barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?
Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That's your favourite.
What about the girl behind the counter?
Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
Thank you.
All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?
All right.
Not relating. Go on.
Oh, now I'm with ya. Okay.
Oh, that's awful.
Well, what happened with your dad?
You poor thing.
And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?
Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.
Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you're causing her right now?
Okay.
Oh, hi. Hi.
We're doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
I'm very happy for you.

You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.
You know what I meant.
I'm sorry I mentioned it.
Well, that's so nice. Who's coming?
You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?
That's an odd mix of people.
You never went into that haunted house.
Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.
There's nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.
Been 15 minutes. Just sayin'.
It's hard to say. I don't remember much after I drank it.
Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee's.
Oh, they're pretty. Thank you.

Really, no one else is coming?
Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.
So, I'm like a lab rat before your real friends come over?
Stuart, you know you're one of our favourite people.
This is the best blintz I've ever had.
I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.
Bye.
I know how it feels, too.
Thank you.
Hmm?
Thank you for noticing.
You know what I love about you?
You never leave the house without a paper clip.
I also love how you never use swear words.
Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.

And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags.
As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.
We're also coming to you live from a different apartment.
So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today's episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.
Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.

It's almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
Oh, you don't want do that, it's a construction zone.
Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?
Anyway, how about dinner?
Thanks, but you don't have to.
Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?
No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?
You're awful quiet, everything okay?
Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?
You heard him, guys, don't ask.
Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn't want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.
She's enjoying living with you and she didn't want it to end early.
Yes.
Eating cake on the toilet single.
Superman's gone, my stormtrooper's gone.
I'd say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn't until next month.
Khoo-vakh! She took my Where's Waldo.

Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.
Food's here.
Oh, uh, they're still working on it.
Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they're gonna be fixing it for a while.
I did, still a mess.
Yeah?
Why are you speaking Klingon?
Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit's pubossubibuble.
You stop that.
ghobe'
Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
I guess it's okay. I'm sorry that I lied about my apartment.
Now that everything's out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?
Are you saying you'd like to live with me?
That would be amazing.
But you won't be living here.
But you won't be living here.
Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.
Thank you for understanding.
Good night.
I don't know. It, it could be.
Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.
Sorry, you brought it up?
It's kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
Yes.
Sorry.
What's going on?
Can it be more of an internal struggle?
How about if I just don't breathe at all?
We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?
We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.
This isn't complicated. Do you love Amy?
Do you like living with her?
Do you know what you need to do now?
Hi.
What are you doing?
I understand. I'll leave you be.
Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
Well, I wouldn't want you to starve to death, so here's an eggplant.
You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.
Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.

It's just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.
A two.
Thank you.
Just think how happy you'll be in a few weeks when I've converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
Okay. Three, two, and we're done.
It didn't hurt, did it?
Okay, fine, one.

If you'd give me a minute, I'll tell you.
Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.
These cells come from both of us.
No reason we can't start right now.
Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky's the limit.
Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it's you.
Good, you know, in case the exit isn't clearly marked.
Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
Mine has a fully developed immune system.
Sheldon, that's enough.

I've never seen results like this before.
Aren't you glad you participated in this?
Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
Make a baby? What are you talking about?
Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.
Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.
Not right now.
I'm not playing anything. We're not making a baby today.
Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's behind door number two.
Hello.
I don't think so.
Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.
I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
Okay, I've had enough.
No.
For God's sake, you're ridiculous.
Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
Ah.
And he doesn't have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.
Right. Be polite.
Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn't believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.
I've gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.
I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I've ever heard.

Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn't believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.
You know what, I've met Bert. Isn't he an indicator of life on other planets?
You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert's research, you'd be less bitter about him winning.
It's like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
Sounds like the night we had coitus.
Sheldon, it's foolish to be angry that Bert's work has merit.
Hey, buddy, why don't we go for a walk, so you can calm down.
Hey, I'm trying to help you.

Really, why?
I couldn't just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you're feeling. My brother and sister's accomplishments have always been held over my head.
I wet the bed until college, but I don't think that's a quality fix.
Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.

What happened?
You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You've got love, you're in good health, you've got a roof over your head.
This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.
I do, your life is fine you big baby.
If it helps, I'm questioning your life choices, too.
There you go.

You're in a good mood.
Well, I'm glad to see you moving forward.
Then the robot uprising has begun.
He doesn't just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.
Thanks. I've been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I'm great.
You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I'm allowed to nominate someone for next year.
So I was thinking, you know, engineers don't get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?
I can't believe you head-butted a water fountain.
It's not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.

Oh, I don't mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I'm walking with my grandma.
Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.
Come in.
What happened to you?
Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone's jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I'll be out of things to wish for.
Is it working?
Well, you know, we're both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.
Sheldon, wait. You know, you've got a lot to be happy about. You're at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.
I can't believe you punched Bert.
Hello, Sheldon.
I understand you're struggling with professional jealousy.
It's fine. I've been on The Simpsons.
I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.
A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know that's true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they're dumb.
If we're going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?
Great, what'd you have in mind?
Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.
Look, we can't just throw away Penny's stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.
Well, I'm sure she misses this one. I mean, it's the greatest gift I've ever given anybody.
It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.


Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.
Yes, you do.
Why don't you keep it?
Yeah, I don't need anything around that I can stab myself with.
Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.
Fine, take the plant.

Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.
So if it breaks there'd be none of it?
So you think you should keep it?
Keep the clock, Sheldon.
Thank you?
Let me guess, you want it.
You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don't care.
Well, you know what's gonna happen, he's just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.
Sheldon, you're, you're being a little selfish. Why don't you let Leonard keep a few things?
You know what? There is one thing I would like.
I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
Yeah, I like this one.
But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they'd jack up the price.
Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I'm happy about it.
Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.
Sheldon, I'm warning you, I can play this game, too.
All right, I tried.
I've got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?
Hey.
Separating my delicates.
Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don't know what he told you, but you can't stay here.
Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?
It's like the '40s again.
All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.
Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I'm O-negative.
Sheldon, get out here.
We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
Because you were being selfish.
I think he might be right. Also, who is that?
So, no one's gonna tell me? Okay.
Well, I'd like that, too.
You promise?

What's wrong?
Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.
I'll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?
I love it. Thank you.
Sheldon.
Is that okay?
I guess, I guess we should stop.
Sheldon, what took you so long?
Well, first deliveries can be slow.
Oh, uh, I don't know. Sheldon, you don't want to do that, do you?
Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!
I'm sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?
So, where were we?
I'm sorry.
Well, shall we start over?
What's wrong?
Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood's a little different now. We, we don't have to rush.
And the mood continues to change.
Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
No.
It's not about trains.
Stop talking about trains.

One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I'd let Harry Potter make things hotter.
I got a Gryffindor robe for you.
I did. Am I in trouble?
Wait, what just happened?
Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?
I know that. But to be fair, I've spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I'm being generous.
I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?
Sheldon and I are living together.
Well, you're all thinking it, I'm the only one who hasn't done anything worthwhile.
Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I'm every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.
I've come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.
Oh, look at all the babies.
Well, that was quite a day.
I was afraid you'd be too tired.
Well, he didn't throw up on the baby. That's a win.
Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
Well, you're home now.
Did you at least have a good flight down there?
And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.
So, while we're at your mother's house, it might be a good time to tell her that we're living together.
Maybe there won't be one.
Well, she likes me. You know, there's a chance she might be okay with it.
Mm.
Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.
Oh, that's wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?
They haven't said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.
Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.
Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.
Obviously, I would prefer if you weren't living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I'm very happy for you.
Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.
No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there'd be nurses.
Sheldon, don't overreact.
What?
Sheldon, what, what are you doing?
We're ignoring the fins, okay.
That's exactly what she was saying.
Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.
You know, I'm sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you're not alone.
What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
Well, let's try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.
She was gonna find out eventually.
Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.
This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.
That's right.
Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.
Have you? How am I feeling right now?
You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
Oh, it's no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.
On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.
Okay. Then what happened?
I don't understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.
By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.
Sure.
Really? You're never gonna touch their baby?
Sheldon.
Thank you, Sheldon, I'm feeling better now.
Not me, paternity leave.

Why?
That's nice. I wear a size eight and a half.
Are you gonna laugh at the answer?
If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she's taking me.
So, hang out with me and we'll have boys' night.

Hey.
Some wine.
What? Where is this coming from?
Fine, go ahead.
I'll call you when we get to the hotel.
Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.
Bye.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you more.

Thanks.
Earl grey?
Honey?
Unsweetened almond…
Sorry, thank you.
I really don't know.
I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.
Its not that I'd stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.

Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
I don't want to wait two days for us to work this out.
Okay. I don't get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.
Nice to see you, too.
I'm trying to figure it out.
Sheldon, why don't we give them some privacy?

Uh-huh.
Hey.
What do you say?

Does it really need to say that?
Me, too.
I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
