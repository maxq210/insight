Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Here we go.
One. .
Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?
Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.

No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! .
Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?
You don't know me, you don't wear my chains… God, that's a good song.
Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.
You're making eggs for breakfast?
How come you didn't go into work today.
Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?
What's the matter?
How so?
Hi.
Maybe they just want to be friends.
What, you're a zebra, right?
No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.
What are you doing?
Oh, hey guys, what's up?
And over here is Sheldon.
Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programmes in India.
Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.
Oh, no it isn't.
Hey Sheldon!
I didn't screw it up.
You're lucky I didn't run you over.
Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…
That would have hurt her feelings.
I remember symposium.
We're going to Long Beach?
You still told her I lied.
I… I don't…
Yes.
Have you considered it?
Hey.
Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.
Thanks for the heads up.
So nothing, let's destroy him.
So, is that your team.
Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!
No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…
He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.
What the hell's going on?
He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
Goodbye Shelly.
Can you just let us in.
Exactly.
All of them.
What does that mean?
What's AFK?
Oh my God, a treasure chest, I'm rich!
Why should I do something, you're the one who introduced her to online gaming.
Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.
What?
Sheldon!
Sheldon.
Yeah, honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?
I'm taking you home.
Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?
Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.
Sheldon, I'm not going to learn Morse code at three o'clock in the morning!
Hello. Hey, Howard. What's wrong? Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.
Okay, where is he going?
So, this wasn't the awkward part?
Okay, feeling the awkward now.
Well, what about me?
The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
No, I'm not. I'm bleeding.
Okay, I'll be right in.
Thank you.
Yes, we did, Kripke.
Oh, please, we've spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.
Yeah?
Oh come on, really?
I'm sowy. No, my fwiend?
No, that's wong. There's an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.
Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.
The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven't paid my rent.
Wow, you got a lot of money in there.
Really? I mean, are you sure?
I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.

Golden Dragon.
Yeah, buddy?
Yeah, I wish.
My money's on tuck and roll.
I see. Well, it seems once again, you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.
Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off, I won't have to be a waitress anymore.
That's all?
Who's Radiohead?
We're all out.
Hello.
Yes
Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I'm telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.
Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Fine. You win.
Then what was oh, boy?
Okay, how's that?
Everybody?
To the North Pole?

I mean, I know she's not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?
Yeah, that's very comforting.
Yeah, wow.

Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it's… don't ask.
Well, they're pretty tasty.
Yes!
Hey. What's going on?
I've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
Okay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!
No.
Come and get it.
Sulphur.
Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?
And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!

Sheldon help!
Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?
And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
Well, how could you not put in an abort?
You want me to put it back?
Sheldon…
Oh, great selection, great prices.
Yeah, okay, cool. I don't need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.
Mitzy's dead?
Come on, let's get a drink.
What was that?
It's obviously a typo.
There's a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
Don't worry, the net's going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.

Oh.
Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?
Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland.
Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?
No.
Better acoustics for your throat singing?
Oh, for God's sakes.
Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it's Penny, not you!
You've also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
No! It wasn't a betrayal. It was more of a can't afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.
What are you doing?
You won.
True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.
It wasn't my fault. I had never seen my brother's project. And my mother could've told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
What's the matter?
It tells me that I am living rent-free right here . You ready to bowl?
Hey, look. They named their team after me.
Leave me alone, Sheldon.
The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
Okay, here's the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
I definitely smell raw hot dog.

Yes.
I guess not.
Oh, come on. I don't want to sit by myself.
Can I ask a question about your roommate?
What for? It's not going to rain.
No, just keep walking.
Why not?
Why?
Can I ask you a question?
And that is?
Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
Really? You're changing the Sheldonian calendar?
It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.
Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
Oooh!
Don't try to change me, dude. I am what I am.
I'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
No.
Alright, this goes without saying, but I'm just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
What do you want.
Oh, I'm so sure I'm going to regret this, but, who was I with?
Papaya?
What are you doing up?
Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I'm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.
Would you say that's about 40 milliliters?

Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.
What is that?
He's got the movie! Get him!
Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.
Great.
That's thinking ahead.
Lesser Warlord of Ka'a.
Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard's mother in high-heeled boots?
But I fired you.
No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
Howard Wolowitz. Why not World's Greatest Engineer?
Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.
We are not having coitus.
We weren't getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
Yeah, hi.

Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.
Really? What do we tell Siebert?
Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year's donations might go to, say, the geology department.
Well, wherever we're going, she's sending a car to pick me up.
Okay, I'm out of here.
These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It's transmitting to your phone.
I'll show you one more time. Raj?

What?
Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?

Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
That, that's brilliant.
All right.
Oh, yeah, she's got puddles in all the right places.
Thanks. Wow! What's with the fancy spread?
Just let it go, Sheldon.
Listen, I don't want to be rude, but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so…
Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.

How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff'rent Strokes? Now the world don't move to the beat…
Doesn't matter. You're out, he's in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.

Uh, no, that's not it. Just come with me, please.
Who's Mohammed Lee?
Thank you.
I'm going to a party. I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
Sounds delicious.
You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.
Sorry. Syrup.

You can have whatever you want.
Will you relax? I'll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?
Come on, it's your turn. We said we'd get more fresh air.
If you're worried, we can go over there and see if she's all right.
You do?
Yes.
With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?
Sure.
Yes.
Morning, Jimmy.
That's nice. Anyway, I've been dreaming of this day for a long time.
Actually, that's only 750. Everything's on sale.
We both know that's your koala face.
Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.
Oh, that is not true.
I haven't bonded with it.
There. Done.
Ninth?
Yeah.
Sheldon, I'm working. I can't take you to the dentist. Also, and I can't stress this enough, I don't want to take you to the dentist.
Told ya.
Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?
Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that's the love story Disney should tell.
I'm sure it was.
Well, as wong as we're here, I might as well take a weak.
Cooper.
Have you ever seen them?
Uh, sweetie, are you all right?
You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again. We don't know what's gonna happen.
Well, sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.
We are going to play the online game.
I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
Uh-uh.
Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
Gummy bears? Thank you.
It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.
It was great. We talked about movies.
I showed him some card tricks.
You walk away.
Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
Have I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis?
What's the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn't want to sit by myself.

Worst bedtime story ever.
In case you didn't follow that, I'm the coffee.
No, of course not. How did you know about that?
Yes.
Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it's not exactly groundbreaking.
Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard's final descent has begun.
Yep!
Why not?
I'm not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.

Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.
Then don't do it.
Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.
Honey, you can't make people like each other.
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
Are you okay?
It's not a big deal. He's just in her history class. They're working on a project together. I don't even know why I care. You know what, I don't care.
Yeah.
What are you doing in there?
Why would it trouble you? It's, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.
Sheldon, this isn't helping. Why don't you just let me get some rest.
That was great. Rub my chest again.
I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
Oh, my.
What's wrong with Christmas?
Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.

It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?
I'm missing something.  Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
Why would you do that?
What are you doing here?
No.

Cooper?
Want me to make you some tea?
You're not sick. You just don't want to face Kripke.
Maybe you don't, I do. What's the deal?
Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
What is wrong with you? If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.

See? You can't. I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.
Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy's a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.
Oh, hi. What's up?
Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?
Do you remember his old theme song?
Where is he?
No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.
We'll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali's bloody corpse, and says,  don't worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest.  Well, I'm just a tree, but if I were you, I'd listen to your ghost friend.
A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.
All right, let's just get this stupid game over with.
That's nice.
What?
You're being ridiculous.
Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren't?
Okay.
Yeah, just as well. It's a pretty rare piece. I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.
Lucky guess.
You want to take the bus to work?
You know what? You're a crazy person.
Oh, that's cute. Like it's a real college.
It's not funny.
Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.
Okay. Oh, it's a bowling alley.
Mm-hmm. And?
I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.
Are you crazy? You don't want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.
Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let's kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we're talking.
Doesn't matter.
Sheldon?
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we're forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.
Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?
Good night.
Mmm. I'm gonna say not. That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she's snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.
Well, you're welcome.
Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?
Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.
I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.

No.
Oh. Well, good boy.
And out.
They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…
Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.
I already found a guy online who's willing to sell.
Did you tell them that you're holding your convention at a Marie Callender's, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?
Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.
That is no way to speak to your mother.
Included?
Let me put this in a way you'll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren't real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.
Next message.
Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.
Sheldon, I've got some bad news.
And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you've seen hundreds of times isn't?
Hey, buddy. Heard you're having a rough day. You all right?

I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.
That'll be $2.99.
Fine, a dollar.
I'm gonna miss you.
Just tell her.
Dr. Cooper.
Oh, come on. You might've gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.
Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you're gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I'm out. But if you're interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I'm willing to give this a shot.
I'm heckling you. It's a beloved part of baseball.
Great.
Why?
How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
Yup.
Oh. Is it Amy?
But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as. It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.
Okay, just one question. What?
Here's a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?
You're making me worry. What's going on?
Well, I do know that it won't be from an asteroid strike.
Fine. It's sweet that you care about him so much.
Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.
Ugh!
Ugh, what?
You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.
You do? You're not messing with me?
Sure.
Son of a bitch.
That's not true.
No.
Well, that's always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.
Of course not.
But I made a video.

Well, that is an important part.
Exactly.
Well, what's your plan?
Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.
Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
Sheldon.  Sheldon.  Sheldon.
Sheldon, you're not in charge. Raj is in charge.

How would I be blinded?
Maybe we should recalibrate it.
Yes, of course.
Calm down, dear. Mary, I'm curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?
Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?
Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
Bye, Sheldon.

If there was a hidden compartment, don't you think you'd be stuffed in it by now?
Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.
Let's see, a lever, a lever.
Scientific Principle: Accelerated Corrosion.
Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.

Hang on. Wait, you actually think it's 2003?
Are you?
In fencing, we don't call it a stab. We call it a touch.
Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.
Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?
Thirty seconds.
Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it'll be fine.
Sure. What is it?
Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
What are we gonna do?!
Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.
Yeah, are you ready for this?
You mean before you give it to me?
Yes.
Hi.
Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.
Still making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.
So, was the fight really bad?
If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.
He's been saying that since he was little. I still don't know what it means.
Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon's bringing me my whiskey.
Oh, well, you know, now, now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar.
You really think so?
And then there's this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
Hello, Sheldon.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Hey.
Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?
Yes.
I thought you might like it.
But why wouldn't…
Why do you have a storage unit?
I don't think I've lit a real fire before.
Okay, I'll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
I don't want to.
Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.
Me? How? Why?
Okay, have fun.
You bet.
Ugh. Too much wine.
Helium.
It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we'll save a spot in line for you.
We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you over the head with his stick chair.
He's got him there. The D even stands for department.
Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.
You're not a lawyer, Sheldon, you're just a know-it-all.
What are you doing?
Are you okay?
Rising rapidly.
Oh, please, you're barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?
That's an odd mix of people.
Thank you.
Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
Khoo-vakh! She took my Where's Waldo.
Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
No.

I do, your life is fine you big baby.
Is that okay?
Oh, uh, I don't know. Sheldon, you don't want to do that, do you?
Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?
Well, you're all thinking it, I'm the only one who hasn't done anything worthwhile.
Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.
No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there'd be nurses.
We're ignoring the fins, okay.
You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
Uh-huh.
I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
