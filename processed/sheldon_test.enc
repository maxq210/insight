Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.
We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
Yes I now, but…
No.
Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this.
Come on, we should go.
That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?
You don't know me, you don't wear my chains… God, that's a good song.
No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
You know, I'm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.
120?
Interesting.
What happened to your scrambled egg research?
Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?
Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.
Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.
Uh, a choo-choo train?
I still don't get it.
Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Then he and I are on equal ground.
What's that?
How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
Anything else I should know.
Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!
We could cut it into thirds.
That works.
No.
Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.
Back off Sheldon.
Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.
But you're not Princess Punchali.
Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.
I didn't screw it up.
Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologise for?

Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.
I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.
Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.
Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your… uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of… um… he's nuts.
Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
Well yeah.
Okay, here's the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.
Well, for one thing, we're late for Leonard's birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security.
Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.
Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here's my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.
What's wrong with your face?
What?
I hate trains.
Well I'm glad that's settled.
What secret. Tell me the secret.
What about Leslie Winkle.
Okay, let me put it this way, if you're really Leonard's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
Chosen by science?
Sheldon, what is it?
So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.
Look at that sign up there.
Oh, good God.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.
Well, what a thrill.
Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
Good night, Sheldon.
No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.
I could think about you.
Oh, clearly I could have.
Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.
No, you're not.
That's absurd.
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?
It's David Underhill. So what?
I don't know. ‘Cause it's Christmas?
Oh, snap.
Family.
Uh, I guess. They're right over there by the wooden train set.
I bet you do.
Curious George is a monkey.
Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.
What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
Well the “check engine” light is fine. It's still blinking away. It's the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.
Oh, I'll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.
Then what difference does it make?
That's Summer Glau.
So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back.
He's calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn't use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.
Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.
Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.
No, sorry.
We're all out.
I'm sorry, that really is how it works.
Yes
I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle's house in Orange County to pick up her TV?
Let it go, Sheldon.
Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.
No, I'm tired.
You got it.
Damn it. What do you want me to do
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um…
Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?
Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
What happened?
I don't know, empathy? Anyway, I'm just saying that you're feeling upset about something with Howard, and I'm upset about something with Leonard.
Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
We believe cows are gods.
Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.
I'm the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
No.
For you or with you?
How did you get here?
So walk home.
Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
I's the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can't believe they had one for dogs.
Good-Bye, Sheldon.
Sheldon, come in.
I don't get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.

Calm down, we'll make the movie.
Are you really going to be on NPR?

I have to take notes?
Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?
Five?

Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don't we just go to the galleria and walk around?
Oh, boy.
Sheldon, I'm begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don't want to go alone.
Hey, that's pretty cool. What is it?
What's going on?
Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?
What are you doing? Use the door.
Sheldon, are you okay?
Yes.
I thought I smelled popcorn.
No.

Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?
Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?


I'm sorry you feel that way.
No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan's doing him a favour.
Oh, that's right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.
Whoa! What do you mean all?
Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.
That's no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen's court.
Yeah, so?
Um, I don't know, maybe.
Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.
Interesting. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
Hey, where you been?
Let's go.
You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.
Hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.
She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
Where's Penny?
What?
I don't object to the concept of a deity, but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
Why not?
Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things you should probably know.
I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.
Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?
Hey, Howard, what's up?
What's a dogapus?
Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
Shamy?
So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
That was rude.
It's getting pretty late, how come you're still up?
You've really got to get out more.
An orang-u-tan?
To, uh, Lucky Baldwin's.

Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.
Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
Let's look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.
Oh, no. Why?
I'm sure it'll wash off.
So are you guys coming to my New Year's Eve costume party?
You're jogging.
Good-bye, Sheldon.
Ooh, I call Kermit.
Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
What are you doing?!
Aw.
Well, you don't like it?
We weren't getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?
Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.
This is all about listening and responding.
Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.
All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you're sad to see him go. I'm gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That's your cue.
What?
Are you insane? I'm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.
Oh, sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.
I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's. I think Howard's going to be there. You want to join us?
Come on in.
Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
What's with the wand and the beep?
All right. . Two of hearts.
I'm really sorry, Sheldon.
Really? How could you tell?
Fine, don't tell me.
I know. It'll be awful.
Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India's a goofy place.
A good question, Howard. Turns out you can't. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?
I'm available for experimentation.
Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.
I need a hug.
Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You're a good friend.
Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it's time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.

Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.
You're kidding.
Hit me.
When a suitcase just won't do.
They slept together, Sherlock.
How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you'd started growing again.
What's the gist, physicist?
What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?

Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?
Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?
For example, if Shelly was aboard, he'd write “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!
Yeah, me, too. I can't make up my mind.
What's up?
Well, I, I'm gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don't you think it could have waited until then?
Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Bye.
At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.
Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
What do you want us to do about it?

I'm sorry, Sheldon.
I am not washed-up.

You okay?
I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore.
What's that?
We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He's in town and wants to have drinks.
Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you're a big-time scientist now.
Sheldon.
Yes.
Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
Ooh, look who's out on a date. Pasadena's favourite power couple, Shamy.
Of course I do, I'm a princess, and this is my tiara!
We all do. Now, how about dinner?
How about now?
I don't care. I'm done.
Their meatballs are pretty good.
No.
It's just a blackout, I'm sure the power will be back on soon.
Since when don't you knock? It's like the only good thing about you.
Positive.
Fine.
Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that's the love story Disney should tell.
No.
So sad.
What's up, fewwas?
Can't this wait?
Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that's, that-that's what chess is all about.
There's not a hair on my body I wouldn't let this woman trim.
Okay, what do you think?
Interrupting physi…

It was great. We talked about movies.
Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?
That's nice.
Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.
You must be burning up.
Dessert is served.
You do?
Just watch the movie.
The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.
Hang on, please. Hello?
Rainbow, not chocolate.

Hello, boys.
Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?
Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Do you expect me to build this?
Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.
What do you mean?
What?
I don't know.
Nope.
What do you think?
What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?

And who was that?
Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.
No.
Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?
‘Kay.
Okay. Um, I know she's a fan of The Canterbury Tales.
She's pretty good, huh?
Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let's get out of here.
Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.

You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.
Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?
Yes.
You sure about that?
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.
No, no. I, I hate that puppet.
See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.
Wow. Talk dirty to me.
Okay, you know what? I give up. I'm going to bed.
Oh, I just cannot believe you're here.
Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…
I'm going to work. You can come if you want.

Fifty cents off Vagisil.
No, you weren't because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.
Okay, it's not gonna say that.
Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.
Well, wait. Don't you want to know how I figured it out?
Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It's perfect.
No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there'd be too much of me for you, not the other way around.
Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?
No.
If I didn't have you, life would be blue, I'd be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.
Oh, Sheldon.
Trust me, I, I remember.
Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?
From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Of course you woke me, it's seven thirty.
Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.
So, does your dad still live in Texas?
Hey. Howie says you've been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.
So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.
It's just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It's like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.
I remember why it's been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.
I'm just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow. But now, it's just one small part of a pretty great life, and it's a part that I'm happy is there.
I, I don't understand. All you've done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.
How come you never said she was pregnant?
And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let's try Warrior 2. And hold.
Anyone in?
I don't own a pocket watch.
Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?
All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn't gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?

His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.
Hey, can I come in?
Oh, dear Lord.
Huh?
Oh, crap.
How old were you then?

You know what? Why don't we just ease into this. Let, let's go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.

I am. Oh, it, it's fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I've gone without running into a men's room in, in, in years.
Happy Star Wars Day.
You don't have to make me anything.
It's nice that you called them esteemed.
Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.


Yeah.
Seriously? You don't even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
We're doing everything we can.
I'm sorry, so you never went outside?
I'm mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?
Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.
Yes.
Yeah.
Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you're gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I'm out. But if you're interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I'm willing to give this a shot.
All I do is win, win, win no matter what.
That's so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
Some perfect couple. He won't even share his food with her.
What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
Yeah. I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
You, okay? It's you. You're, you're next.
Fine. Then we'll just stay here and do it.
You would go to a beach house?
Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.
I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.
Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.
Fine, it bothers me. You happy?
Did you go to your prom?


Hi. Ready to go?
Look, I know you don't like it, but that's the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.
Now, you just get comfortable.
Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
Sure.
Is that really true?
Now imagine you're holding that pen.
Now open your hand and let it go.


Did they hate it?
Well, that is an important part.
Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.
That soy Frappuccino I had.
Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.

You did flop around a lot.
Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.
Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera's on, they're both on the same network. We should be getting an image.
Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.
Why not?
She's upset. Look, it's gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.
There's no guy.
I'm not glowing. I'm upset.
No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.
Whose bra is this?
Come on, buddy.
I'm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.
I know what you're doing. You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you, but it's not happening.
Okay, look, we don't need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we'll sleep over there, and sometimes we'll sleep over here.
Fine.
I don't know what that means.
I said no.
Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it's nice to see you. You look good.
And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?
What about from when you were a kid?

You sure you're up for that? She did hurt you.
Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.

Are we done discussing the weather?
Great.
I, I was just curious. How, how'd it go?
Spineless.
Wait, what happened to us?
Glad to hear it.
Why don't you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I'll explain to you why you're wrong.
Nope.
Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?
I park fine.

Is that nice to say to your friend?
You have an engagement ring?
Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.
I suppose.
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.
Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.
That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
Nice hat, Sheldon.
Okay, I'll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
I'm surprised you would do that.
What, he arrested you for that?

So does that answer your question?

Hey, Penny, um, since you're already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?
I can't believe we're gonna get beat up, and it's not because of your chair.
Uh, who's hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.
We're not gonna be brothers. We're not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
Well, why? What's wrong?
Well, you're kidding, right?
Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.
And my cousin's a lawyer.
Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don't think that's happening.
You only had one.
That's not helpful. It's fun to think about, but it's not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can't do this without you. Can you please pull it together?
Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?

Thank you.
You never leave the house without a paper clip.
Yes.
Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn't believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.
You know what, I've met Bert. Isn't he an indicator of life on other planets?
Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.
Sheldon, wait. You know, you've got a lot to be happy about. You're at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.
I can't believe you punched Bert.
If we're going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?
Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.
You know what? There is one thing I would like.
Well, I'd like that, too.
I did. Am I in trouble?
Well, you're all thinking it, I'm the only one who hasn't done anything worthwhile.
Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.
So, hang out with me and we'll have boys' night.
Bye.
I really don't know.
