We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
No.
That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. However briefly.
So Penny's a little messy.
You betrayed us for money, who are you?
By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.
Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
I'm sorry?
Oh, hey Sheldon, what's going on?
You're welcome.
You don't believe in luck.
Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing…
Okay.
Good night Sheldon.
What are you doing?
You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.
No.
What are you guys doing here?
If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.
Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.
Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.
No, no not at all. A little bit.
Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.
You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.

It's two o'clock in the morning
Yes.
Wait, what?
Well imagine how I'm feeling.
Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.
Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?
You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?
Great.
Denied.
Yeah, good for you.
Hee-hee, just classic.
That's fascinating, but I…
So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?
Uh, Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
I'm sorry, I don't get the point.
Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it.
Well, yeah.
Hey.
What do you mean, you're moving out? Why?
I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.
Don't make this hard for me.
Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.
Yeah.
Sheldor?
Hey, check it out, it's just corn starch and water.
Why should I do something, you're the one who introduced her to online gaming.
Thank you.
That's on the registration?
Why? Don't!

And when we go in there, let's show Raj that we're happy for him.
Dr Hoffstadter.
And mythological.
How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
So wait,you're just gonna give up?
Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?
Thank you.
What?
Where are my clothes?
Get them down.
Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.
That's just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
Please don't do that.
She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.
What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!
What are you doing?
Not yet.
Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I've seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.
On the floor.
Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
Interesting.
I'm not afraid of him.
Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
Understandable.
Why not?
Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.
What up, Moon Pie?
Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.
Sheldon, wait! Will you?
Yes.
All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?
Oh hey, guys, where're you headed?
Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
When did you pick up on that?
Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.
Leslie Winkle. You've reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.
That's Superman's big ice thing, right?
Have fun, Sheldon.
Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.
Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
What?
Sheldon, it's two o'clock in the morning.
Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.

Hang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
Because when he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that's an ordinary field cricket.
What's the matter, you chicken?
I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.
Yeah, well, I don't like bugs, okay? They freak me out.

Ooh, we're honey now, are we?
Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out, I swear to cow!
I'm busy.
Sheldon, that is incredible.

All right, I won't set one aside for you.
You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It's a totally different set of characters.
Two-headed tiger.
What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell's heart, stab at him!
I really appreciate this.
All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.
Who is this Justin?
How is that not talking to me like I'm an idiot? It's my friend, it's my couch, and it's my freakin' life!
You brought your mother into this!
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.
I'm back here.
No one's saying that. Let's go.
I don't want you to see me naked.
You ready know that.
Thank you, Sheldon.
Yeah, okay, cool. I don't need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.
Then I don't know.
It's not?
No. We would just walk around and see what's what.
He'll have a Shirley Temple.
No. I'm looking for a hookup.
Listen, they're kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.
So what? It's the same food.
Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?
It's obviously a typo.
I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.
We're fine, Sheldon.
No, Jim, don't open the door!

He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.
Oh, no, he's going to telecommute. Everybody's really excited about it.
Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I'm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
Sheldon, what do you want?
Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
Rupert Murdoch?
That is so sad.
And it wasn't when we were driving like this?
All right. I'll bet your Meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.

It's ridiculous.
Why don't we just talk?
It wasn't my fault. I had never seen my brother's project. And my mother could've told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
You might want to check YouTube.
You're not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?
So, we're all clear on the bet and the stakes?
Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!
Tough luck, Sheldon.
Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs?
I know, I know.
Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?

A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
Guys, how 'bout some music?
Yes.
So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
There's no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
Funny how things work out, isn't it?
Uh, no.
Fine, but don't expect my help.
No, it's not.

Like everybody else's. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?
No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.
Hey, Sheldon.
Okay, yeah, fine.
No. It's too Brobdingnagian.
No, no. Maybe a little.
Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend. How do I look?

Aha, you're funny.
What are you talking about?
C'mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she's attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
Exactly. Sometimes you can't win.
Hysterical!
All right. I'll have to go shopping.
Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.
Mee-sa think that very funny.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
And?
Hey. Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?
You can't replace me with Zack.
Good-bye, Sheldon.
Ooh, I call Kermit.
You know what's a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.
No.
No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
Why not?
No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody's suffered enough. The thing is, you're going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
Oh, you're welcome.
Hey. So you guys ready to order?
Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don't we try some improvisation?
I am not going to have sex with her.
That's very nice of you, but I made other plans.
Ugh!

What's the difference?
Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.
A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.
What's with the wand and the beep?
Oh, my God, what did they get?
Yes, he does live with his parents. Here's a Google Earth shot of their house.
I totally had one of those.
Nice shot.
Oh. That's too bad. I wonder what happened.
What?
Opa!
Make yourself comfortable.

Oh, cool. Can I play?
So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing that when you two get married, you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?
Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.
Don't flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
What?
You called my mother?
Oh, good.
You know, some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance. They'd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
I don't want to talk about it. You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.
Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.
Hey, Sheldon?
Sounds delicious.
Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he's fine.
Sheldon.
You have a thing of paper clips right there.
What are you doing?
No. I'm having a moral crisis.
Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
If you're keeping him, I've got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.
Sheldon, I'm disappointed. As a brilliant man, you're entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.
Sheldon, why don't you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don't want her going out with other men?
Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive.
Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
Okay, let's talk about that.
Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.
You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let's go.
Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don't see why we can't be friends. And I'm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don't want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.
Five.
Positive.
All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.
Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.

H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?

You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again. We don't know what's gonna happen.
Well, I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke the other night about me eating all your food.
Who's there?
Why, they're just toys?
I told you, no.
Yeah, yeah, I know, he's the wheelchair dude who invented time.
Now zip me up.
Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.
You mean, like in bed or in the shower?
Yeah, so?
Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that's the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.
I'll take it.
Okay, what did Amy tell you?
Worst bedtime story ever.
Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.
Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?
August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?
We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
I don't care. Get the Tardis.
No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he's not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.
Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
I'm talking about important things like emotional maturity.
My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.
Hi Sheldon.
A what?
Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there's a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.
All right. I'll tell him.

I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there because the paper would be graded.
Oh. I've been wanting to talk to you. I'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.
You're talking about Leonard.
I'm missing something.  Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.
What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
I say we investigate.
Cooper?
Oh, teacher! Me! Me!
128.
Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we're gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.
Aw. Here's what I think of your roommate agreement.

What did I do?
You're a coward.
Um…
Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?
Subtle, but powerful.
…when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That's how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.
Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn't have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.
Fine, then that.
Is that a problem?
Roots?
Excuse me. I'm here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.
There is no season three. They cancelled that show.
And now?
A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.
It wasn't me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…
Okay, I'm hanging up now. You know there's no such thing as a k…
This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he's off having a good time?

Thank you. How about a hug?
Happy to, unless it's hope or a reason to live.
That's nice.
So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
Fine. What I did was wrong.
Oh, I just cannot believe you're here.
Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?
Oh.
What?
The what?
Please leave me out of this.
Really?
So, you're okay with this?
Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.
No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there'd be too much of me for you, not the other way around.
Buddy, I don't think you can. I mean, once it's out there, it's out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.
If I didn't have you, life would be blue, I'd be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.
Me? What did I do?
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.
Sheldon.
I should be so lucky.
That one over there.
I must say, Sheldon, you're handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.
Sheldon.
Yeah, I know a little something about that.
Well, you're about to be in an even better one. I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.
Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don't even live near each other.
Fine, I'll publish.
Okay, Barry, that's enough.
You know, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it's okay with you.
Hello.
Hey, how's your sister?
Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?
Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.
Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you're cool with at you…
Well, the diner scene. Where's my diner scene?
Sure.
To my room.
No.
No.

Before you get upset, I believe I've come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.
We're going to have Valentine's Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.

Oh, I've already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.
Which you also figured out by yourself.
Which is stronger than ever.
You don't need to explain yourself to him.
I think we're gonna go.
Yes.
Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.
All I'm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom's happiness.
No.
First new message.
You're being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
Happy Star Wars Day.
May, maybe for you.
Oh. How's it going?
And go where?
I don't care.
Butterfly could've gotten himself home from Arizona.
This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they're wrong.
I'm thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?
Because it's taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I'm in the centre now, and I love that even more.
So, this is accurate?
My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.
Guys.
I think it'll be pretty clear. If not, we'll take a vote. Oh, and also…
Negative reinforcement is really wrong?
Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.
How you feeling?
But you're okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You're a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.
Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.
No, because I liked it.
What?
How is this helpful?
Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.
Don't worry about that. I'm happy to take you to work.
He's still in surgery.
Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career, and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.
Merry Christmas, Sheldon.
I, I'm sorry? You make compromises for me?
Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.
Call me if you need anything.
All right, next, we're gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.
Ready? Begin. Why'd you pop it?
What's up?
I'm sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.
It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I'm telling you for the last time, take the cap off.
Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We're insightful and innovative.
Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.
Did he respond yet?
Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?
Oh, that sounds like a good thing.
Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.

If it's half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I'm in.
Yeah, I bet you anything it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.
Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
How's it going, Sheldon?
Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I'm gonna go to sleep.
Yeah, I'm good.
Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.

Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
With a beautiful girl on your arm.
Boy, oh, boy, that's a lot of pieces.
Suicide.
Hey.
Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.
Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
We're gonna set a date.
Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.
Why not?
I'm not taking sides.
I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.
Fine. My old scarf.
Yeah.

Sheldon, can you believe that we're driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It's like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn't cool.
We have plenty of food for the animals.
Hey, we're going to dinner. You want to come?


Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I'll report you, then I'll pound your asses into the ground.
What was it about Spock that appealed to you?
No. It's okay. If we're friends, we should be able to talk about anything.
But you can pal around with a hagfish?
How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?
Hey. We're going to the comic book store. You want to come?
I can change it back.

I miss you.
Why don't you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I'll explain to you why you're wrong.
Wow. I'm impressed.
Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.
Of course, I wasn't invited.
Thank you.
Oh, it's okay, Sheldon. Come with us.

Is that nice to say to your friend?
Well, now I know.
Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don't know if I can do that again.
So do I.
All right, what about music?
Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.
Look, I'm, I'm sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.
Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.
Whatcha doing?
That's not what the forest smells like.
What, he arrested you for that?
That's right.
Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch Game of Thrones over here.
Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?
How come your head has your face on it?
Oh, good for you.
Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I'm having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.
It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we'll save a spot in line for you.
Yeah, special, like that.  That's them. Please don't make things any more awkward than they already are.
Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant. She wasn't ready for them to know.
I've never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.
Hang on.
Anyway, how about dinner?
But you won't be living here.
I don't think so.
Because you were being selfish.
Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.
Uh-huh.
What do you say?
