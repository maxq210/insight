I'm going to invite her over. We'll have a nice meal and chat.
What?
Yes, I remember.
Well I'm not trying to have sex with her.
Can we please stop saying coitus?
No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Here we go.
Men do things for women without expecting sex.
Dammit man, we're dying here.
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
Is it too much?
You could have stopped at “it could go well.”
I know, I'm familiar with you.
Make it two.
Well, what do you think.
You don't believe in luck.
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.
What, you're a zebra, right?
No.
Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he's worse.
I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there?
That would have hurt her feelings.
How?
Do you have a cousin Leopold.
So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?
What for?
No kidding?
If I stand, I'll vomit.
Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.
Yeah, we really ruined his life.
Hello, Sheldon.
Correct.
Denied. I need your official answer.
No.
It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.
Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.
Those are movies.
Excuse me?
Look, you're here, we have plenty of room.
Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
Sheldon 2.0?
Well, Sheldon, you're his friend. Friends give each other presents.
Exactly.
Okay, so we're getting this one?
Blow your own nose and go away.
And some of those skinless chicks were hot.
Why, what's so unusual about me having a date?
Come on, Sheldon, there's so few places I can wear my jester costume.
Hey, Sheldon.
Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…
No Sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.
Hey, check it out, it's just corn starch and water.
Well, wear different pyjamas.
Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!
Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine's office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.
Yeah, honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?
You don't need air bags.
It's never safe.
Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.
Seriously? You're not coming?
Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I'm Kathy O'Brien. I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.
All right. Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry.
Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.
What?
Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.
Hi, Sheldon.
Oh come on! Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.
You're going to need to stop talking immediately.
That doesn't count. Do over! Do over!
Gather round, kids, it's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas special.
Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.
Not yet.
Hello Sheldon.
Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you're out of the apartment?
No.
I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.
Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it's only for a week. Can't you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn't really think that through.
Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.
I'm afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
Sheldon, we've been on this train 90 seconds, and you've already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.
Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.
Okay, I found the box. Now what?
So?
Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.
Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
A day?
I'm sorry, that really is how it works.
I like green lantern, I'm just saying it's pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.
Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we've been in lately.
What's up?
Okay, look, Sheldon, it's late and I've got to get some sleep.
Oh, you're welcome sweetie.
I'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
What do you want?
Yeah.
I can't press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!
Me either.
And we agreed to never speak of it again.
It's great to see you too. Come on in.
Okay, can someone please tell me what's going on here?
Oh, give me a frickin' break. How could you possibly know that?
Hallway.
Are you crazy? We can't go down an empty elevator shaft.
What happened?
What do you have a safe deposit box for?
They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.
No, this has to stop now.
No.
You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?
That's the only logical inference.
What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell's heart, stab at him!
Please, I'm asking you as a friend.
Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way.
It's a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he's in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we're in, but he can't perceive us.
Oh, for god's sakes, I'm in the bathroom!
Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?
Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.
But don't look.
No.
Never mind, what's your announcement?
But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don't answer, it's wetowical.
Are you really going to be on NPR?
Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.
‘Cause I want to surprise him.
I have to take notes?
Five?
You are, it's just…
Um…
Mmm, well, let's see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard's father?
Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.
How is that going to help them?
Don't worry, the net's going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.
Which leads to…?
No cilantro?
Yes.
You're right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.
Yup.
Hi. I'm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.
Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?
We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where's the ring?
Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, 'cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.
We think we can help you with your stage fright.
I'm sorry, I'll start again.
Yes!
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
No, this isn't fair to you, Leonard. I'm sorry.
Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?
So, how you been?
Interesting. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
Let's go.
He's been crying?
I'm in bed!
Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin' around.
It is if you love her and give her a name.
Okay, we've got power to the laser.
Why not?
Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
Sheldon.
Yeah. Well, my question is, and I'm pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?
No! No! No. Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?
Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
I don't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
So, you're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
Sheldon, six bucks.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Oh, Sheldon!
Seconded.
So what's going on with you two?
That sounds lovely.
From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.
Give me a minute. Sheldon,
Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!
Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.
As a matter of fact I.. I… I can't… I can't… I can't do it.
Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?
Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.
A what?
Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don't you give it a try.
What? Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.
Oh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.
Why do I bother talking to you people?
Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.
Ask what?
Hey. Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?
There's Zack.
I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
Well, actually.
Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I'm a little warm, so I'm going to turn it down.
Okay, we need to stop for a minute.
Seriously, I have a great idea for one.
Oh, my God, I'm crying already.
Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I'd like to weigh in.
What?
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
That's good. That's good. That's good.
Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.
I believe that's what your roommate did to her.
Ugh!
Yeah?

What's going on?
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!
Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.
Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
Yeah, you do. You dog, you.
My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.
Okay, suit yourself. We'll probably be trashing Priya a little.
Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.
A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I'm sleeping.
Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business.
We give up.
Elegant.
Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.
Somewhere where no one's seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile.
Let it go, Sheldon. I'll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.

No.
Will you listen to me play my harp now?
What's in the bag?
Well, it's a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.
Sounds delicious.
Sure. One thing you really miss when you're on vacation is laundry.
Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don't you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.
You can have whatever you want.
Sheldon.
Oh. Yeah. That's gone. It's a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
No, I was talking to the bird.
I really don't get your problem with birds.
Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?
Sheldon, I'm disappointed. As a brilliant man, you're entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.
I am not washed-up.
A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
Please. You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
Who do we love?
Hi, Stuart.
Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
It's good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.
Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.
Some people go outside and do that.
Eight o'clock.  Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.
Sorry. I'm having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
I don't care. I'm done.
I've got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
Lobster traps?
Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.
What about Supercuts?
Where are you going?
Yeah, but it's got lightsabres.
No.
That's what your father used to say?
Well, we're always the good guys. In D&D, we're lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we're the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.
I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she's parking the car right now.
Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long for it to be funny.  I was wrong, it's still funny.
What?
I didn't break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.
He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
Let me try gansta, hells no.
Well, I thought I'd start you off by polishing my belt buckles.
Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
Okay, uh, I'd pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I've always dreamed of having.
Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body.
Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you. And still, you're the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.
Make all the jokes you want, but there's only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.
I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you.
We're playing doctor. Star Trek style.
I know what the anthropic principle is.
I'm all for it.
Funny. We're always giving each other a hard time up here. It's kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.
Hey, Stuart, come on in.
Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
Talk about what?
Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it's not exactly groundbreaking.
I can go thirty.
Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.
Yeah, that's when it started.
Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.
On the count of three. One, two…
You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.
No.
You ever hear back from Hawking?
So don't do it.
Cut.
What?
We just told you.
If you're wondering why I've been staring through the peephole, I'm trying to get a look at this guy who's coming over to Penny's.
You don't need a parking space. You don't have a car.
Okay, you need to move now.
I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it's not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I'll park in the structure across the street.
You're the bigger man, Sheldon.


Nerds!
Sheldon, your food's getting cold.
You doing okay, sweetie?
Whatever. You get any wast night?
What is wrong with you? If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.
Yes.
What did I do?
Yeah, and I've seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.
‘Kay.
I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine's Day?
Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy's Facebook page and read up on her interests.
Uh, I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?
Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?
Guys, please don't make this a school project where I'm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.
Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight's the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.
You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.

Sheldon!
Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?
You didn't bring another gift, did you?
Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.
All I'm saying is, we live in a world where closure isn't always an op…
Thank you.
You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?

That's not ridiculous. Good night.
You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children's science show?
And now?
Sheldon.
Okay.
So that means I lose, right? It's over?
Really? That, that's it? That's comforting?
Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?
I'm sorry, Sheldon. I should've told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.
I didn't make it back. The ship sank, I'm in hell.
Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
Well, we've all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
All right, Sheldon, you win. I'm sure Leonard is gonna love this.
So? That's my dinner from last night.
What?
It's not funny.
Riddle me this…

Please let me be there when you tell her that.
I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would've happened if I hadn't tried to help you.

Damn it, everyone's better at this than me.
Sheldon, come on.
Hi, Sheldon.
Ooh, what are you gonna get?
Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you're employing?
What?
Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.
You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.
Did you miss me?
To my room.
I don't know.
I'm gonna go talk to Penny.
Bye.
Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.
Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
Nope.
Did you tell them that you're holding your convention at a Marie Callender's, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?
Mm, Sheldon, you didn't have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.
All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn't gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?
I was there. It was funny.
You ready to talk about it?
Good luck.
Go to your room.
It's going to be okay.
After she put you to bed, she went home.
First new message.
What ails her?
Does she work in a similar field to you?
Comforting you?

Are you okay?
Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
Sheldon, it's okay with me that you're not perfect.
Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough to take your class.
Yes.
Might be something to think about.
I am.
It's an inverted cycloid.
So do we. And I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
Fine. Then we'll just stay here and do it.
Oh. It's wonderful, and I swear I'm not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.
But you're okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
How's that going?
Oh. Is it Amy?
Sheldon, is everything okay?
You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You're a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.
Next game, let's switch helmets.
Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal. End of story.
I don't have epilepsy, either.
Just go to work, he'll be fine.
Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
I do.
How come you're up so late?
Congratulations.
Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers 'cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why'd you turn it off?
Okay, new subject. Let's talk about presents. What did you get Amy?
Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.
What are you doing? It's time to go.
Really?
I'm not a preschooler.
Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We're insightful and innovative.
Is that really true?
Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it's not a big deal.
You know, some people try visualization.
And then they finish it off by staring into each other's eyes for four minutes.
Uh, well, I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.
But I made a video.
He might not be.
Keep going.

Um, uh, uh, uh, we don't have an appointment, and, and we don't belong here, but we, we're, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in.

Hey.
It wasn't, so are you in?
With a beautiful girl on your arm.
Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they're a bouquet of severed plant genitals.
Are you ashamed of me?
Sorry, I forgot.
Yeah.
I'm not taking sides.
Of course not.
Please, tell me how I can fix it.
Oh, not just him, you're coming, too.
So, I'm your seventh choice.
I'm proud of you. You're taking this really well.
Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he's interested in her.
Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.
What?
Let's go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
Who is he?
How does he get the helium?
Done.
Nice to meet you.
I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.


Sheldon. We've known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.
If I may, I believe what he's saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don't mind me.
Yeah, are you ready for this?
Why isn't it ever Angie Dickinson's bedroom?
Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.
Sheldon, if, if you're with the right person, it, it'll be okay.
Hi.
So, um, should I get under the covers with you?
But, uh, what, what about Amy?
What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?
No.
Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.
That is a great idea.
All of them?
Are you feeling any better?
Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
Can this wait?
Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.
Why are you defending him?
Thank you.
Oh, you're welcome, Moon Pie.
Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
I suppose.
No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you're not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.
I'm just gonna push all the buttons.
Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.
The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
I thought you might like it.
And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
Nice hat, Sheldon.
What is the problem?
All right, here goes nothing.
I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.
That is very mature of you, so I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah.
Did you guys see there's an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon's gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.
I said, Sheldon says he's sorry.
You made it.
Go to sleep.
Well, why? What's wrong?
Thank you. All right, let's continue.
I am having coffee.

That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?
Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.

Great. That's your side.
Oh, oh, oh.
What's going on here?

I wouldn't worry about it. She's probably just distracted by work.
Although, in Aristotle's example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.
Sheldon, if I'm gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I've done this dozens of times, but if you're too scared you don't have to.
Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it's remarkable, but it's still limited in what it can do.
Great. Now that we're friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?
How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you're brilliant?
Oh, it was fine.
Uh, chips.
Go ahead, it's fine.
It's there on purpose. It's refreshing.
