__Leonard Agreed, what's your point?
__Sheldon There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a tee-shirt.
__Receptionist Hang on.
__Leonard One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
__Receptionist Can I help you?
__Leonard Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?
__Receptionist If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
__Sheldon I think this is the place.
__Receptionist Fill these out.
__Leonard Thank-you. We'll be right back.
__Receptionist Oh, take your time. I'll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.
__ Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
__Leonard What, are you kidding? You're a semi-pro.
__Sheldon No. We are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
__Leonard Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.
__Sheldon I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.
__Leonard I'm sure she'll still love him.
__Sheldon I wouldn't.
__Leonard Well, what do you want to do?
__Sheldon I want to leave.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon What's the protocol for leaving?
__Leonard I don't know, I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.
__Sheldon Let's try just walking out.
__Leonard Okay.
__Receptionist Bye.
__Sheldon Bye-bye
__Leonard See you.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
__Leonard Not really.
__Sheldon If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.
__Leonard I don't care. Two millimetres? That doesn't seem right.
__Sheldon No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.
__Leonard Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
__Sheldon No, that was the result of my work with lasers.
__Leonard New neighbour?
__Sheldon Evidently.
__Leonard Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
__Sheldon Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.
__Penny Oh, hi!
__Leonard Hi.
__Sheldon Hi.
__Leonard Hi.
__Sheldon Hi.
__Penny Hi?
__Leonard We don't mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.
__Penny Oh, that's nice.
__Leonard Oh… uh… no… we don't live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.
__Penny Oh, okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbour, Penny.
__Leonard Leonard, Sheldon.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Hi.
__Sheldon Hi.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.
__Penny Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.
__Leonard Oh, great.
__Penny Great.
__Sheldon Great.
__Leonard Great. Well, bye.
__Penny Bye.
__Sheldon Bye.
__Leonard Bye.
__Leonard Should we have invited her for lunch?
__Sheldon No. We're going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
__Leonard We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
__Leonard I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.
__Sheldon We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
__Leonard Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.
__Sheldon I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
__Sheldon That's the beauty of it.
__Leonard I'm going to invite her over. We'll have a nice meal and chat.
__Sheldon Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.
__Leonard Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.
__Sheldon To what end?
__Leonard Hi. Again.
__Penny Hi.
__Sheldon Hi.
__Leonard Hi.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
__Sheldon Leonard, I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.
__Penny Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?
__Penny Oh, that's so nice, I'd love to.
__Leonard Great.
__Penny So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
__Sheldon Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Okay, thankyou.
__Leonard You're very welcome.
__Penny This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?
__Sheldon Actually that's my work.
__Penny Wow.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, it's just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke, it's a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.
__Penny So you're like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Penny This is really impressive.
__Leonard I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.
__Penny Holy smokes.
__Sheldon If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.
__Leonard What?
__Leonard At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
__Sheldon I didn't invent them, they're there.
__Leonard In what universe?
__Sheldon In all of them, that is the point.
__Penny Uh, do you guys mind if I start?
__Sheldon Um, Penny, that's where I sit.
__Penny So, sit next to me.
__Sheldon No, I sit there.
__Penny What's the difference?
__Sheldon What's the difference?
__Leonard Here we go.
__Sheldon In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I've made my point.
__Penny Do you want me to move?
__Sheldon Well.
__Leonard Just sit somewhere else.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Leonard Sheldon, sit!
__Sheldon Aaah!
__Leonard Well this is nice. We don't have a lot of company over.
__Sheldon That's not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
__Leonard Yes I now, but…
__Sheldon Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
__Leonard Yes, I remember.
__Sheldon I resent you saying we don't have company.
__Leonard I'm sorry.
__Sheldon That is an antisocial implication.
__Leonard I said I'm sorry.
__Penny So, Klingon boggle?
__Leonard Yeah, it's like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That's probably enough about us, tell us about you.
__Penny Um, me, okay, I'm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
__Sheldon Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.
__Penny Participate in the what?
__Leonard I think what Sheldon's trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.
__Penny Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else, oh, I'm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.
__Sheldon That's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
__Leonard Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?
__Penny Oh, yeah, I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
__Leonard Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.
__Sheldon You're lactose intolerant.
__Leonard I don't eat it, I just think it's a good idea.
__Penny Oh, anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
__Leonard So it's based on your life?
__Penny No, I'm from Omaha.
__Leonard Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.
__Penny I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else? Um, that's about it. That's the story of Penny.
__Leonard Well it sounds wonderful.
__Penny It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.
__Sheldon What's happening.
__Leonard I don't know.
__Penny Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that's like as long as High School.
__Sheldon It took you four years to get through High School?
__Leonard Don't.
__Penny I just, I can't believe I trusted him.
__Leonard Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
__Sheldon You? No, you'll only make it worse.
__Penny You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Our shower works.
__Penny Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon No?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard It's right down the hall.
__Penny Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
__Sheldon Well this is an interesting development.
__Leonard How so?
__Sheldon It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
__Leonard That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode.
__Sheldon Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.
__Leonard The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
__Sheldon So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
__Sheldon That woman in there's not going to have sex with you.
__Leonard Well I'm not trying to have sex with her.
__Sheldon Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed.
__Leonard What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me, I'm a male and she's a female?
__Sheldon Yes, but not of the same species.
__Leonard I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbour.
__Sheldon Oh, of course.
__Leonard That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. However briefly.
__Sheldon Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
__Leonard It's Darth Vader shampoo.  Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.
__Howard Wait till you see this.
__Raj It's fantastic. Unbelievable.
__Leonard See what?
__Howard It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
__Leonard This is not a good time.
__Howard It'.
__Leonard That's great, you guys have to go.
__Raj Why?
__Leonard It's just not a good time.
__Sheldon Leonard has a lady over.
__Howard Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?
__Leonard No. And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbour.
__Howard Hang on, there really is a lady here?
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Howard And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?
__Leonard I'm not anticipating coitus.
__Howard So she's available for coitus?
__Leonard Can we please stop saying coitus?
__Sheldon Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
__Penny Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!
__Howard Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.
__Penny Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
__Leonard Come on, I'll show you the trick with the shower.
__Howard Bon douche.
__Penny I'm sorry?
__Howard It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
__Leonard Save it for your blog, Howard.
__Howard See-ka-tong-guay-jow.
__Penny Okay. Thanks.
__Leonard You're welcome, oh, you're going to step right, okay, I'll….
__Penny Hey, Leonard?
__Penny Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.
__Leonard A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.
__Penny It's okay if you say no.
__Leonard Oh, I'll probably say yes.
__Penny It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you've just met.
__Leonard Wow.
__Leonard Must we?
__Sheldon Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?
__Leonard She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.
__Leonard Which is?
__Sheldon You think with your penis.
__Leonard That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.
__Sheldon Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV.
__Leonard Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.
__Sheldon No I don't. And neither do you.
__Leonard Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.
__Sheldon You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.
__Leonard To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
__Sheldon So we get to have a scene with him?
__Leonard No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.
__Sheldon Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.
__ Uh, I'm sorry, do you speak English?
__Howard Oh, he speaks English, he just can't speak to women.
__Penny Really, why?
__Howard He's kind of a nerd. Juice box?
__Voice from buzzer Yeah.
__Leonard Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard What did I just…. Uh, we're here to pick up Penny's TV.
__Voice Get lost.
__Sheldon Okay, thanks for your time.
__Sheldon Leonard, the TV is in the building, we've been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.
__Leonard Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.
__Sheldon My apologies. What's your plan.
__ It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
__Leonard Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
__ What do you think their combined IQ is?
__Leonard Just grab the door.
__Sheldon Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.
__Enormous man Yeah?
__Leonard I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
__Man How the hell did you get in the building?
__Leonard Oh. We're scientists.
__Sheldon Tell him about our IQ.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon My mom bought me those pants.
__Leonard I'm sorry.
__Sheldon You're going to have to call her.
__Sheldon It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last.
__Leonard And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.
__Leonard Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I've got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.
__Sheldon Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone.
__Leonard Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.
__Sheldon And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
__Penny Wow, cool tiger.
__Howard Yeah, I've had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.
__Penny Uh, sounds interesting.
__Howard So you'll think about it?
__Penny Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.
__Raj Smooth.
__Leonard We're home.
__Penny Oh, my God, what happened?
__Leonard Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
__Penny I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.
__Leonard No, it was a valid hypothesis.
__Sheldon That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
__Penny Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?
__Leonard Really? Great.
__Sheldon Thank you. You're not done with her, are you?
__Leonard Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
__Sheldon Not to mention imaginary.
__Penny Sure.
__Sheldon We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.
__Penny So?
__Sheldon They're both curry based cuisines.
__Penny So?
__Penny Any ideas Raj?
__Howard Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
__Penny That sounds like fun.
__Howard Baby, baby don't get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
__Sheldon I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable Mack Daddy.
__Howard But does it have peanut oil?
__Leonard Uh, I'm not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
__Sheldon Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.
__Raj Are there any chopsticks?
__Sheldon You don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.
__Leonard Here we go.
__Leonard Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.  I'll get it.
__Howard Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
__ Hey Leonard.
__Leonard Oh, hi Penny.
__Penny Am I interrupting.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon You're not swelling, Howard.
__Howard No, no, look at my fingers, they're like Vienna sausages.
__Penny Sounds like you have company.
__Leonard They're not going anywhere.  So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work.
__Penny Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.
__Penny Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was….
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny Oh. Okay, great, I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so….  Oh! Hel…hello!
__Penny I'm sorry?
__Howard Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
__Penny No, I haven't.
__Howard Get used to it.
__Penny Yeah, I probably won't, but… Hey Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hi.
__Penny Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?
__Sheldon Don't take it personally, it's his pathology, he can't talk to women.
__Howard He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!
__Leonard So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?
__Penny Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.
__Leonard Yeah, no problem.
__Penny Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.
__Penny Yeah?
__Leonard Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
__Sheldon You're kidding, right?
__Penny Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?
__Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together One.
__Sheldon You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
__Penny Yes, I know, men can't fly.
__Sheldon Oh no, let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.
__Leonard Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.
__Sheldon In what space, sir, in what space? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.
__Leonard Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.
__Sheldon Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth's yellow Sun.
__Howard Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.
__Sheldon Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.
__Penny I'm just going to go wash up.
__Leonard I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
__Sheldon Challenge accepted.  We're locked out.
__Raj Also, the pretty girl left.
__Sheldon I hardly think so.
__Leonard Why not?
__Sheldon Well, we don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.
__Leonard We don't need strength, we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it's just a matter…  I don't have this… I don't have this I don't have this.
__Sheldon Archimedes would be so proud.
__Leonard Do you have any ideas?
__Sheldon Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.
__ Time shift, Leonard and Sheldon are now lowering the package onto the bottom of the stairs.
__ Easy, easy  Okay! Now we've got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.
__Sheldon Exactly half.
__Leonard Exactly half. Let's push. Okay, see, it's moving, this is easy, all in the math.
__Sheldon What's your formula for the corner.
__Leonard What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.
__ Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.
__ Time shift, they now have the package on an upstairs hallway, not their own.
__ You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
__Sheldon Yeah, those are men who just had sex.
__ Quick cut to the hallway of their floor, they are nearing the top of the staircase.
__ Almost there, almost there, almost there.
__Sheldon No we're not, no we're not, no we're not.
__Leonard You okay?
__Sheldon No, it hurt…  Great Caesar's Ghost, look at this place?
__Leonard So Penny's a little messy.
__Sheldon A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.
__Leonard Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.
__Leonard Come on, we should go.
__Sheldon Hang on.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon Straightening up.
__Leonard Sheldon, this is not your home.
__Sheldon This is not anyone's home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.
__Leonard When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.
__Sheldon Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man's closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.
__Leonard What were you doing in his closet?
__Sheldon I helped run some cable for a webcam.
__Penny Hey guys.
__Leonard Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.
__Penny Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon No?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Well, we'll get out of your hair.
__Penny Oh, great, thank you again
__Sheldon Penny, I just want you to know that, you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you.
__Penny What's he talking about?
__Penny I don't get it.
__Leonard Yeah, he didn't tell it right.
__Sheldon Sssshhhh! Penny's sleeping.
__Leonard Are you insane, you can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.
__Sheldon I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this.
__Leonard Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here?
__Sheldon I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
__Leonard No, no. You gave me an explanation, it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.
__Sheldon Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.
__Leonard Sheldon, we have to get out of here.
__ You might want to speak in a lower register.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they'll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.
__Leonard That's ridiculous.
__Sheldon No,  that's ridiculous.
__Leonard Fine. I accept your premise, now please let's go.
__Sheldon I am not leaving until I'm done.
__Leonard O-o-o-oh!
__Sheldon If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.
__Leonard Oh, what the hell.
__Leonard Morning.
__Sheldon I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.
__Leonard I'm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour's apartment and clean.
__Sheldon Sarcasm?
__Leonard You think?
__Sheldon Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny's quality of life.
__Leonard You know what, you've convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.
__Sheldon You don't think that crosses a line?
__Leonard Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.
__Sheldon You have a sarcasm sign?
__Leonard No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.
__Sheldon Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.
__Penny Son of a Bitch!
__Leonard Penny's up.
__Penny You sick, geeky bastards!
__Leonard How did she know it was us?
__Sheldon I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
__Penny Leonard!
__Leonard God, this is going to be bad.
__Sheldon Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.
__Penny You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?
__Leonard Yes, but, only to clean.
__Sheldon Really more to organise, you're not actually dirty, per se.
__Penny Give me back my key.
__Leonard I'm very, very sorry.
__Penny Do you understand how creepy this is.
__Leonard Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.
__Penny In my apartment, while I was sleeping.
__Sheldon And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.
__Penny And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
__Sheldon Depending on the depth, that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading “Sarcasm”) Oh!
__Penny God!
__Leonard Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.
__Penny Stay away from me.
__Leonard Sure, that's another way to go.
__Sheldon Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  Well that was a little non-responsive.
__Leonard You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  What's funny?
__Sheldon That wasn't sarcasm?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. (Knocks on Penny's door.) I have a masters and two PhD's, I should not have to do this.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could.
__Raj Ooh, she's standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?
__Penny You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?
__Raj She's so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl. We'd have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.
__Penny It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.
__ Raj
__ I mean, just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?
__Raj She asked me a question. I should probably nod.
__Penny That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll.
__Raj Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis.
__Leonard It's fine. You win.
__Howard What's his problem?
__Sheldon His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
__Howard Been there.
__Raj Hello. Sorry I'm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.
__Howard Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?
__Leonard What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
__Raj Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me.
__Howard She hugged you? How did she hug you?  Is that her perfume I smell?
__Raj intoxicating, isn't it?
__Leonard Oh.
__Penny What's going on?
__Penny Leonard.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny We're okay.
__Sheldon Check.
__Leonard One package, Phillips head screws.
__Penny Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.
__Leonard No, please, we insist, it's the least we can do considering.
__Sheldon Considering what? How great this place looks?
__Howard Oh boy, I was afraid of this.
__Leonard What?
__Howard These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
__Penny Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.
__Leonard It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.
__Sheldon We could put her stereo back there.
__Leonard And control it how?
__Sheldon Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.
__Howard Good point, how you gonna cool it?
__Penny Hey guys, I got this.
__Sheldon Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?
__Leonard Also inefficient, and might be loud.
__Howard How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC…
__Penny Guys, this is actually really simple.
__Howard Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.
__Leonard Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?
__Sheldon And if water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.
__Penny Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.
__Leonard Oh, I've got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.
__Sheldon Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink.
__Howard Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.
__Leonard Meet back here in an hour?
__Howard Done.
__Leonard Got it.
__Penny Okay, this place does look pretty good.
__Sheldon Good lord!
__Raj Oooh.
__Leonard Don't panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.
__Howard Stay frosty, there's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.
__Leonard Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.
__Sheldon Lock and load.
__Howard Raj, blow up the gates.
__Raj Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!
__Howard Don't just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.
__Leonard Stay in formation.
__Howard Leonard, you've got one on your tail.
__Leonard That's alright, my tail's prehensile, I'll swat him off.
__Raj I've got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
__Leonard Raj, no, it's a trap, they're flanking us!
__Raj Oooh, he's got me.
__Howard Sheldon, he's got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!
__Sheldon I've got the Sword of Azeroth!
__Leonard Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.
__Sheldon There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!
__Howard Leonard look out!
__Sheldon Goodbye, peasants.
__Leonard The bastard teleported.
__Raj He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
__Leonard You betrayed us for money, who are you?
__Sheldon I'm a rogue knight elf, don't you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”
__Howard I am the Swordmaster!
__ Credits sequence
__Leonard No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
__ Sounds like your neighbour's home.
__Leonard Excuse me.
__Sheldon Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.
__Leonard Oh, right, right right right right.
__Howard Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it.
__Leonard Penny, the mailman did it again, he…  Oh! Sorry.
__Penny Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard.
__Doug What's up bro.
__Leonard Not much. Bro.
__Penny Is, is everything okay.
__Leonard Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.
__Penny Thank you, I've got to talk to that mailman.
__Leonard Oh no, that's probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.
__Penny Okay, well, thank you, again.
__Leonard No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro!
__Sheldon Penny for your thoughts.
__Raj What's the matter.
__Leonard No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and…
__Leonard What is wrong with you?
__Howard I'm a romantic.
__Sheldon Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
__Leonard No, I'm not jealous, I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.
__Howard Because he looked better than you?
__Leonard Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
__Sheldon Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again.
__Howard I disagree, love is not a sprint, it's a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray.
__Leonard Well, I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.
__Raj Like who?
__Leonard I don't know. Olivia Geiger?
__Sheldon The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Well, I don't think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.
__Howard I don't know, you guys work in the same lab.
__Leonard So?
__Howard There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I'm… a bit of a self-taught expert.
__Leonard Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I'm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.
__Howard Oh, then you're probably okay.
__Lesley Hi Leonard.
__Leonard Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
__Lesley Goggles, Leonard.
__Leonard Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.
__Lesley Hang on. I'm trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o' noodles.
__Leonard Pfff, I've done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.
__Lesley Wait, are you asking me out?
__Leonard I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don't need to quibble over terminology.
__Lesley What sort of experiment would you propose?
__Leonard There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.
__Lesley Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.
__Leonard Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes.
__Lesley Well, why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable.
__Leonard You mean, kiss you now?
__Lesley Yes.
__Leonard Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
__Lesley Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?
__Leonard Thank you.  Shall I count down from three?
__Lesley No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.
__ What do you think.
__Leonard You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.
__Lesley Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal.
__Leonard None?
__Lesley None.
__Leonard Ah. Well, thank you for your time.
__Lesley Thank you.
__ None at all?
__Sheldon That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?
__Howard Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side.
__Sheldon Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's three laws of robotics?
__Raj You might be bound by them right now.
__Howard That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?
__Sheldon Of course not.
__Howard Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?
__Sheldon Well, no.
__Howard I smell robot.
__Leonard Hey, what's going on.
__Sheldon The internet's been down for half an hour.
__Raj Also, Sheldon may be a robot.
__Howard So, how did it go with Lesley?
__Leonard Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.
__Sheldon Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it.
__Raj You could power down.
__Howard Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.
__Howard I think Mrs Tishman's got her eye on you. I've been there, you're in for a treat.
__Leonard You don't know me, you don't wear my chains… God, that's a good song.
__Sheldon If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.
__Leonard I know what you're thinking, I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.
__Sheldon Leonard, listen to me…
__Leonard I've been thinking about names, I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.
__Sheldon Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?
__Leonard Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.
__Sheldon Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.
__Leonard It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me, the woman rejected me.
__Sheldon Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.
__Leonard You're right. I didn't ask her out, I should ask her out.
__Sheldon No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don't buy a cat.
__Leonard No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out.
__Sheldon Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.
__Leonard Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh… I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.
__Penny Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?
__Leonard There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.
__Penny Supper?
__Leonard Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.
__Penny Uh, six thirty's great.
__Leonard Really? Great!
__Penny Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.
__Leonard Us guys?
__Penny You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all's coming?
__Leonard They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't, it's no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.
__Penny Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.
__Leonard Great. Did we say a time?
__Penny Six thirty.
__Leonard And that's still good for you.
__Penny It's fine.
__Leonard Cos it's not carved in stone.
__Penny No, six thirty's great.
__Leonard I'll get my chisel.
__Penny Why?
__Leonard To… carve the… okay, I'll see you six thirty.
__Sheldon Could you be more specific?
__Leonard Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
__Sheldon No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
__Leonard Six thirty.
__Sheldon Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.
__Leonard Is it too much?
__Sheldon Not if you're a rugby team.
__Leonard By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.
__Sheldon Why would I join you?
__Leonard No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
__Sheldon Oh, no, no, no, well now, there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.
__Leonard You're right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.
__Sheldon Of course, there's the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.
__Leonard You could have stopped at “it could go well.”
__Sheldon If I could of, I would of.
__Leonard I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there's a pause, we both know what's happening, I lean in, we kiss, it's a little tentative at first but then I realise, she's kissing me back, and she's biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we're going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!
__Sheldon Is the sex starting now?
__Leonard I'm having a panic attack.
__Sheldon Oh, okay, well then, calm down.
__Leonard If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack, that's why they call it a panic attack.
__Sheldon Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.
__Leonard Why?
__Sheldon Just do it.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon It's a bio-feedback technique, it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.
__Sheldon Me?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon What should I tell her.
__Leonard I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
__Leonard Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.
__Sheldon Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal. I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.
__Leonard Give me the phone.
__Sheldon But I thought you wanted to cancel?
__Leonard I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.
__Sheldon Why would she be expecting me?
__Leonard Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.
__Penny Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.
__Penny How?
__Leonard We both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
__Penny So, what's new in the world of physics?
__Leonard Nothing.
__Penny Really, nothing?
__Leonard Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930's, and you can't prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”
__Penny Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up.
__Leonard What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?
__Penny Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.
__Leonard Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.
__Penny Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he's nice and funny, but…
__Waitress Can I get you started with some drinks?
__Leonard No,  You were saying, but…
__Penny I'd like a drink.
__Leonard Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.
__Penny Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.
__Leonard Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex.
__Penny It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless of… well, you know.
__Penny No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.
__Leonard Well, chafing, right?
__Penny Emotionally.
__Leonard Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool?  I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.
__Penny How?
__Leonard Physics.
__Penny Wow, centrifugal force!
__Leonard Actually, it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive.  Excuse me. Now, if you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would
__Penny Are you okay?
__Leonard Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?
__Penny No.
__Leonard I'm not okay.
__Leonard No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding.
__Penny I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?
__Leonard Yes, but I get car sick too, so…
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Sorry about your car, by the way.
__Penny Oh, no, it's fine, you got most of it out the window.
__Leonard The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
__Penny Yeah, me too. Um, good night.  Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Was this supposed to be a date?
__Leonard This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.
__Penny Okay, I was just checking.
__Leonard When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she's been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I'm going to go lay down for a while, good night.
__Leonard Awesome!
__Sheldon Score one for liquor and poor judgement.
__Leonard Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
__Leonard Interesting.
__Sheldon Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.
__Leonard Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover?
__Sheldon It's time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.
__Leonard Then I guess congratulations are in order.
__Sheldon No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I'm not going to enjoy this party.
__Leonard I know, I'm familiar with you.
__Sheldon At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
__Leonard Yes, I was there.
__Sheldon You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Nothing.
__Leonard Well then we'll avoid Finkleday, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
__Sheldon How's this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you've done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.
__Leonard Mahalo's a nice touch.
__Leonard Interesting, you should lead with that.
__Leonard You don't have buffets in India?
__Raj Of course, but it's all Indian food. You can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.
__Sheldon Well here's an interesting turn of events.
__Leonard What.  Howard brought a date?
__Sheldon A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
__Howard Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer.
__Summer I already told you, touching's extra.
__Howard Right. Sorry.
__Leonard Here comes our new boss, be polite.
__Gablehouser Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser.
__Howard Howard Wolowitz.
__Gablehouser Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?
__Sheldon An actual real scientist.  How was that?
__Leonard Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
__Sheldon Morning.
__Leonard You're making eggs for breakfast?
__Sheldon This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.
__Leonard Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
__Sheldon I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.
__Leonard Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
__Sheldon As do I.
__Leonard You know, I'm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.
__Sheldon I don't want my job back. I've spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I'm going to savour it.
__Leonard Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
__Sheldon I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.
__Leonard And we all thank you.
__ Use new eggs.
__Penny Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?
__Sheldon Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.
__Penny I'm sorry?
__Sheldon I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
__Penny Four dozen?
__Sheldon Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.
__Penny Okay, one more time?
__Sheldon Never mind, you won't get it right, I'd better come with you.
__Penny Oh, yay!
__Sheldon I'm taking a sabbatical, because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds.
__Penny So you got canned, huh?
__Sheldon Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.
__Penny Well, maybe it's all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.
__Sheldon No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.
__Penny No, no, I meant…
__Sheldon Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
__Penny Never mind.
__Sheldon Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.
__Penny We're fine.
__Sheldon Look, you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.
__Penny Oh, sure I am.
__Sheldon No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let's say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.
__Penny 120?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?
__Penny Well, yeah.
__Sheldon Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let's say, 4,400lb.
__Penny Let's say 4,390.
__Sheldon Fine. We're travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course.
__Penny Thank you.
__Sheldon No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.
__Penny Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn't you say you needed some eggs.
__Sheldon Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.
__Penny Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.
__Sheldon No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you'll really enjoy this, is, they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit.
__Penny Interesting.
__Sheldon Isn't it?
__Penny No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
__Sheldon Oh boy.
__Penny What now?
__Sheldon Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.
__Penny Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
__Sheldon Well then you'll want some manganese.
__Penny Oh, I don't know Sheldon, it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.
__Sheldon Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Well think about it, it's a product that doesn't spoil, and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.
__Penny You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
__Sheldon Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?
__Penny Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.
__Sheldon Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we're talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  Okay, no warehouse store, but we're still on for put-put golf, right?
__Sheldon I think it's her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.
__Leonard What's with the fish?
__Sheldon It's an experiment.
__Leonard What happened to your scrambled egg research?
__Sheldon Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.
__Leonard So… fish.
__Sheldon I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.
__Leonard Fish nightlights.
__Sheldon It's a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
__Leonard Mum's the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don't want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.
__Sheldon Oh, no, no, no. No, I've too much to do.
__Leonard Right… I didn't….
__Sheldon That's just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we're going to be rich.
__Mrs Cooper You did the right thing calling.
__Leonard I didn't know what else to do, he's lost all focus, every day he's got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one.
__Sheldon Mommy.
__Mrs Cooper Hi baby.
__Sheldon You called my mother?
__Mrs Cooper Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Mrs Cooper Honey, why did you get a loom?
__Sheldon I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?
__Mrs Cooper Leonard called me.
__Sheldon I know, but why?
__Leonard Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
__Sheldon This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone's mother.
__Leonard Really, when was the last time you left the house.
__Sheldon I went to the market with Penny.
__Leonard That was three weeks ago.
__Sheldon Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.
__Mrs Cooper Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.
__Sheldon Yes, well I'm not a child, I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother.
__Leonard Where are you going?
__Sheldon To my room, and no-one's allowed in.
__Mrs Cooper He gets his temper from his daddy.
__Mrs Cooper He's got my eyes.
__Leonard I see.
__Mrs Cooper All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
__Sheldon I'm not hungry.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, Leonard, don't trouble yourself, he's stubborn. He may stay in there ‘til the Rapture.
__Penny Are we so sure that's a bad thing?
__Mrs Cooper I'll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart.
__Howard Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, honey that ain't going to work, but you keep trying.  I made chicken, I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it's a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it.
__Leonard That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?
__Mrs Cooper Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.
__Leonard Sounds like a wise man.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.
__Penny Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it's against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.
__Penny What happened?
__Mrs Cooper Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.
__Leonard A death ray?
__Mrs Cooper Well, that's what he called it, didn't even slow down the neighbour kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple.
__ Both Leonard and Penny laugh, a little too forced.
__ No, we're not, we're not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends.
__Mrs Cooper Did I pluck a nerve there?
__Howard Oh yeah.
__Mrs Cooper Okay. Alright everybody, it's time to eat.  Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker.  Now after a moment of silent meditation I'm going to end with “In Jesus' Name” but you two don't feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you.
__ Time shift
__ Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I've ever had.
__Mrs Cooper It was always Sheldon' s favourite. You know what the secret ingredient is?
__Penny Love?
__Mrs Cooper Lard.
__ Sheldon emerges from the bedroom area.
__ Hey, look who's come out….
__Mrs Cooper Shhh! You'll spook him. He's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
__ Sheldon crosses to the cobbler, takes some and puts it on a plate. Looks round at the group in the matter of a frightened animal. Everyone but Leonard looks down at their meal.
__ This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You're a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room.
__Mrs Cooper You don't hunt, do you?
__Sheldon Morning.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?
__Sheldon It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
__Mrs Cooper But intelligently designed by a creator, right?
__Sheldon What do you want, mom?
__Mrs Cooper You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Mrs Cooper Well, I'm done fishing.  You put those on.
__Sheldon What for?
__Mrs Cooper Because you're going to go down to your office, you're going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back.
__Sheldon No.
__Mrs Cooper I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness?”
__Sheldon I'm not going to apologise, I didn't say anything that wasn't true.
__Mrs Cooper Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody but you can't go around pointing it out.
__Sheldon Why not?
__Mrs Cooper Because people don't like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let's get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let's shove off.
__Sheldon Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
__Leonard Really? That's impressive.
__Mrs Cooper Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.
__Gablehouser Well, actually….
__Mrs Cooper Sheldon, he's just doodling, get in here.
__Sheldon Dr Gablehouser.
__Sheldon Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.
__Gablehouser I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser.
__Mrs Cooper Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.
__Gablehouser Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, aren't you sweet, his father's dead.
__Gablehouser Recently?
__Mrs Cooper Long enough.
__Gablehouser Please. Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?
__Sheldon Okay.
__Leonard Hey, how did it go?
__Sheldon I'm not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.
__Leonard That narrows it down.
__Sheldon Thanks, mom. Mom?
__Mrs Cooper Mmm-hmm?
__Sheldon Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
__Mrs Cooper We'll see. Sleep tight.
__Howard Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.
__Leonard No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.
__Raj Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
__Penny Hi, you guys ready to order?
__Howard Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?
__Leonard And Orcs!
__Penny I'll be back.
__Raj Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.
__Penny Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.
__Howard What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
__Penny A shower.
__Howard I'll take the heart smart platter.
__Penny Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.
__Sheldon We don't eat here, I don't know what's good.
__Penny Well, it's all good.
__Leonard Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.
__Sheldon I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.
__Leonard I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.
__Penny Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?
__Sheldon Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.
__Penny The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
__Penny Because you are not at Big Boy!
__Sheldon Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.
__Leonard Make it two.
__Sheldon Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
__Lesley Hey Leonard, hi guys.
__Leonard Hey Lesley.
__Lesley I didn't know you ate here.
__Sheldon We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.
__Leonard Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.
__Howard And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
__Penny Howard, I've asked you not to do that.
__Leonard Lesley and I do research together at the University.
__Penny Oh, wow, a girl scientist.
__Lesley Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I'm glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist.
__Leonard What happened to Elliot Wong?
__Lesley He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?
__Leonard Yeah, sure, why not.
__Leonard Why at my place?
__Lesley Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.
__Penny Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?
__Leonard Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.
__Howard If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.
__Penny Really?  I'm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend's really cute, anything going on with you two.
__Leonard Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?
__Sheldon He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.
__Leonard Thank you Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?
__Raj Oh dear.
__Howard What's the matter?
__Raj She didn't take my order.
__Howard How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her.
__Raj Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.
__Sheldon Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren't they adorable.
__Leonard If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.
__Sheldon You're a lucky man, Leonard.
__Leonard How so?
__Sheldon You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.
__Leonard Well, what do you think.
__Sheldon I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Lesley Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.
__ Time jump
__ Goodnight guys, good job.
__Male string quartettist Thanks.
__Female string quartettist See you next week.
__Leonard That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.
__Lesley You're welcome. If you're up for it we could practise that middle section again.
__Leonard Uh, sure, why not.
__Lesley Just so we're clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.
__Leonard Really?
__Lesley Yeah, I'm good to go.
__Leonard I thought you weren't interested in me.
__Lesley That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.
__Leonard You mean my cello?
__Lesley No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I'm seducing you.
__Leonard No kidding?
__Lesley What can I say, I'm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?
__Leonard Gee, uh…
__Lesley Is it the waitress?
__Leonard Penny? What about her?
__Lesley Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.
__Leonard Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there's no point in bringing it up.
__Lesley You and the waitress then?
__Leonard No. No, there's nothing going on between Penny and me.
__Lesley So, you're open to a sexual relationship?
__Leonard Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.
__Lesley Good.
__Leonard Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?
__Lesley Why don't we finish the section first.
__Leonard Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
__ I'm good, I'm good to go.
__Lesley Me too.
__Sheldon I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
__Penny I'm sorry?
__Sheldon Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.
__Penny Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not.
__Sheldon Just come with me.
__ Jump to the pair of them standing outside Leonard's bedroom door. Bryan Adams “Have You Ever Loved A Woman” is emerging. There is a tie on the bedroom door.
__ Well?
__Penny Well what?
__Sheldon What does it mean?
__Penny Oh, come on, you went to college.
__Sheldon Yes, but I was eleven.
__Penny Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy.
__Sheldon So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.
__Penny Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.
__Lesley Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.
__Penny We really shouldn't be standing here.
__Sheldon This is very awkward.
__Penny Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?
__Sheldon Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.
__Penny Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?
__Sheldon I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide.
__Penny So, do you know who's in there?
__Penny Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.
__Sheldon No, no, wait, hold on.
__Penny What's the matter?
__Sheldon I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?
__Penny Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie.
__ Hi, Leonard. It's me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You're welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.
__Leonard Hey, what's the matter?
__Sheldon My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
__Leonard Are you sure?
__Sheldon Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign's been changed.
__Leonard Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
__Sheldon Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
__Lesley You're welcome.
__Sheldon You did this?
__Lesley Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?
__Sheldon Cool?
__Lesley Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night.
__Leonard Thank you, I'll see you at work.
__Sheldon Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!
__Lesley What?
__Sheldon Who told you you could touch my board?
__Lesley No-one.
__Sheldon I don't come into your house and touch your board.
__Lesley There are no incorrect equations on my board.
__Lesley I'm sorry, I've got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me.
__Sheldon Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate.
__Sheldon I'm not staring, I'm mulling.
__Penny Oh, hey Leonard.
__Leonard Oh, hi.
__Penny So, how's it going?
__Leonard Pretty good.
__Penny Just pretty good, I'd think you were doing very good.
__Leonard Pretty, very, there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?
__Penny Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.
__Leonard Sheldon!
__Sheldon I'm coming.
__Penny So, is it serious, do you like her?
__Leonard Wuh, I don't…. th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not…. Sheldon, we have to go!
__Sheldon Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.
__Penny Alright, well, I'll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard.
__Leonard Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.
__Sheldon Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
__Leonard You know what, I'm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent.
__Sheldon She's not that intelligent.
__Leonard She fixed your equation.
__Sheldon She got lucky.
__Leonard You don't believe in luck.
__Sheldon I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
__Leonard Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.
__Sheldon Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon I still don't care.
__Lesley Careful  Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero.
__Leonard Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
__Lesley Because I've got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife.
__Leonard So anyway  Hello.
__Lesley Uh, what are you doing?
__Leonard Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
__Leonard I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt.
__Lesley Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.
__Leonard Who wouldn't?
__Lesley Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.
__Leonard Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?
__Lesley Well, I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Years.
__Leonard Oh. Okay. Thank you.
__Lesley Thank you!
__Leonard You want to make plans for New Years.
__Lesley Woah, Leonard, please, you're smothering me.
__Howard Hey, look, it's Doctor Stud!
__Leonard Doctor what?
__Howard The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.
__Leonard Wha… how did it get on the internet?
__Howard I put it there.
__Leonard Well, how did you know about it?
__Raj A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.
__Leonard Well, that part's true!
__Leonard No kidding.
__Sheldon I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.
__Leonard Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
__Sheldon Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.
__Leonard Really?
__Sheldon Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup.
__Penny So, how's everything.
__Sheldon Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.
__Penny Really, oh yay!
__Penny Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?
__Leonard Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.
__Penny Oh, oh that's too bad. Well hey, don't worry, I'm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you.
__Leonard Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
__Sheldon You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
__Leonard Are you even listening to me?
__Sheldon Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.
__Leonard Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup.
__Howard That was absolutely humiliating.
__Leonard Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
__Howard Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's Bar-Mitzvah party.
__Leonard I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.
__Sheldon You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.
__Leonard Sheldon, let it go.
__Sheldon No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.
__Howard I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.
__Sheldon I was giving clear, concise orders.
__Leonard You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”
__Penny Oh, hey guys.
__Leonard Hello Penny.
__Howard Morning ma'am.
__Penny So, how was paintball, did you have fun?
__Sheldon Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.
__Penny Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.
__Leonard A party?
__Penny Yeah.
__Howard A boy-girl party?
__Penny Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing…
__Sheldon Dancing?
__Leonard Yeah, I don't know, Penny…
__Sheldon The thing is, we're not….
__Leonard We're really more….
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.
__Sheldon A Halloween party?
__Howard As in, costumes?
__Penny Well, yeah.
__Leonard Is there a theme?
__Penny Um, yeah, Halloween.
__Sheldon Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?
__Penny As usual, I'm not following.
__Leonard He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…
__Penny Sure.
__Sheldon What about comic-books?
__Penny Fine.
__Sheldon Anime?
__Penny Of course.
__Sheldon TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…
__Penny Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.
__Howard Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.
__ Credits Sequence
__Howard Bjow
__Leonard Oh, no.
__Sheldon Oh no!
__Raj Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!
__Sheldon See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.
__Leonard We all have other costumes, we can change.
__Raj Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.
__Howard No, no, no, it's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
__Leonard Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?
__All Agreed.
__Leonard I call Frodo!
__All Damn!
__Leonard You went with Thor?
__Raj What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect.
__Howard I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
__Raj Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.
__Sheldon I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
__Leonard No, it's not…
__Sheldon If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!
__Leonard Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.
__Sheldon Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?
__Leonard For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.
__Sheldon Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.
__Leonard All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don't want to look like a dork.
__Penny Oh, hey guys.
__Leonard Hey, sorry we're late.
__Penny Late? It's 7:05.
__Sheldon And you said the party starts at seven.
__Penny Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.
__Sheldon It's 7:05.
__Penny Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.
__Howard What, are all the girls in the bathroom?
__Penny Probably, but in their own homes.
__Sheldon So what time does the costume parade start?
__Penny The parade?
__Sheldon Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.
__Penny Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.
__Sheldon This party is just going to suck.
__Penny No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute.
__Leonard Actually, Penny, he's Rob…
__Howard I'm Peter Pan! And I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.
__Penny No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.
__Leonard Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.
__Sheldon Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.
__Penny Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I've got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon See, people get it.
__ Time shift, the party is in full swing, the four guys are sitting together around the coffee table.
__ Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix.
__Howard No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights.
__Sheldon I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?
__Leonard We're socialising. Meeting new people.
__Sheldon Telepathically?
__Penny Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!
__Raj Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.
__Leonard She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.
__Sheldon And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
__Howard Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.
__Raj What is your move?
__Howard I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we're in sync, we belong together.
__Leonard Where do you get this stuff?
__Howard You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.
__Raj Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.
__Howard If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.
__Nurse Costume Girl No thanks.
__Howard No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.
__Leonard I  want to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people.
__Sheldon Well, I actually might be able to help.
__Leonard How so?
__Sheldon Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.
__Leonard Go on.
__Sheldon Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”
__Leonard Then what happens?
__Sheldon That's as far as I've gotten.
__Leonard This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.
__Sheldon Good luck.
__Leonard No, you're coming with me.
__Sheldon Oh, I hardly think so.
__Leonard Come on.
__Sheldon Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
__Leonard Yes. But I need a wing-man.
__Sheldon Alright, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage.
__Girl in Hippie Costume Oh, Hi!
__Leonard Hi.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Girl So, what are you supposed to be?
__Sheldon Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
__Girl Uh, a choo-choo train?
__Sheldon Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
__Girl A brain damaged choo-choo train?
__Girl in Butterfly Costume How wasted am I?
__ Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are now talking to a girl in a princess costume.
__ Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
__Girl I still don't get it.
__Sheldon I'm the Doppler Effect.
__Girl Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive.
__Leonard Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
__ Sheldon Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves.
__Leonard Because I'm Frodo.
__Sheldon Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect.
__Leonard Oh no.
__Sheldon What?
__Leonard That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.
__Sheldon What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
__Leonard If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.
__Sheldon Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now.
__Leonard Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here.
__Sheldon You have a back-up hypothesis.
__Leonard Maybe they just want to be friends.
__Sheldon Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.
__Leonard Then he and I are on equal ground.
__Sheldon Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.
__Leonard Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.
__Sheldon And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.
__Leonard Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.
__Sheldon True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
__Sheldon Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?
__Leonard Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
__Penny Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?
__Sheldon Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.
__Kurt What, you're a zebra, right?
__Sheldon Yet another child left behind.
__Kurt And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?
__Leonard No, I'm a Hobbit.
__Kurt What's the difference?
__Leonard Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.
__Kurt So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?
__Sheldon Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.
__Kurt Well, whatever, why don't you go hop off on a quest, I'm talking to Penny here.
__Leonard I think we're all talking to Penny here.
__Sheldon I'm not. No offence.
__Kurt Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.
__Penny Alright Kurt, be nice.
__Kurt Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.
__Penny Kurt!
__Leonard Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.
__Kurt Are you calling me a puffy animal?
__Penny Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?
__Leonard No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.
__Sheldon If he understands that, you're in trouble.
__Kurt So what, I'm unevolved?
__Sheldon You're in trouble.
__Kurt You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.
__Penny Okay, Kurt, please.
__Leonard No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?
__Kurt Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.
__Leonard A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
__Kurt What?
__Leonard I think I've made my point.
__Kurt Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.
__Sheldon Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.
__Kurt C – O – N… frontation!
__Penny Kurt, put him down this instant.
__Kurt He started it.
__Penny I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down.
__Kurt Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.
__Sheldon He's a Hobbit! I've got your back.
__Leonard Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so….
__Penny Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.
__Sheldon Happy Halloween.  If it's any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.
__Sheldon Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Good. There there was really all I had.
__Leonard Good night Sheldon.
__Sheldon Good night Leonard.
__Penny Hey Leonard.
__Leonard Hi Penny.
__Penny Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
__Leonard I'm fine.
__Penny I'm so sorry about what happened.
__Leonard It's not your fault.
__Penny Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.
__Leonard So why was he at your party?
__Penny Well, I ran into him last week and, he was…  just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and… I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to… (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard's shoulder.)
__Leonard There there.
__Penny God, what is wrong with me.
__Leonard Nothing, you're perfect.
__Penny Gah, I'm not perfect.
__Leonard Yes you are.
__Penny You really think so, don't you?
__Leonard Penny?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard How much have you had to drink tonight?
__Penny Just…. a lot.
__Leonard Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?
__Penny It might. Boy, you're really smart.
__Penny Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?
__Leonard Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.
__Penny I should probably go.
__Leonard Probably.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire.
__Howard Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?
__Sheldon He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.
__Howard He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God.
__Sheldon Thank you for the clarification.
__Howard I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
__Sheldon Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer.
__Howard's phone Howard' Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?
__Howard No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
__Howard's phone Howard' Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader.
__Howard No.
__Leonard Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.
__Howard's phone Howard' Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. (Raj's phone rings).
__Raj Oh, that's very impressive. And a little racist.
__Sheldon If we're all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.
__Leonard So? We'll start now.
__Sheldon Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.
__Raj We can split it two, two and two.
__Howard If we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time.
__Sheldon Oh, what fresh hell is this?
__Leonard Hey Penny, come on in.
__Penny Hey guys.
__Howard See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.
__Penny No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.
__Leonard Sure. What's going on.
__Penny Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she's like “Hey, how's California,” and I'm like “Awesome” ‘cos, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.
__Sheldon 8:08.
__Penny Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.
__Howard Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse.
__Penny He really needs to dial it down.
__Leonard So, if you don't like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?
__Penny Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.
__Sheldon You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?
__Leonard Oh, I don't think she's a whore.
__Penny No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where's Howard?
__Howard Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you're new in town.
__Sheldon Oh good grief.
__Sheldon And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it's 8:13 and we're still not playing Halo.
__Leonard Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back.
__Sheldon One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!
__Leonard Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
__Penny Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.
__Sheldon Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.
__Sheldon Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.
__Penny Oh, what, what, what?
__Penny Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?
__Sheldon Mine.
__Penny Okay, I got this, lock and load boys.
__Leonard It's the only way we can play teams.
__Sheldon Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh….
__Penny Ha-ha, there goes your head again.
__Sheldon Okay, this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!
__ Time shift
__ Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me.
__Penny Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!
__Leonard Penny, you are on fire.
__Penny Yeah, so is Sheldon.
__Sheldon Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.
__Penny Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.
__Sheldon What?
__Penny This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look, it's raining you!
__Sheldon You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.
__Penny Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?
__Leonard Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.
__Penny Well, it's been fun.
__Leonard You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
__Penny Or we could just have a life.
__Penny Good night, Leonard.
__Leonard Good night.
__Penny As usual, nice talking to you Raj
__Raj What do you suppose she meant by that?
__Leonard She's an enigma, Raj.
__Sheldon And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab…
__Leonard She's gone, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Well she could have said goodbye.
__Penny Okay, I have a problem.
__Sheldon It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.
__Leonard What's wrong?
__Penny Um, well, Howard and Christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom.
__Leonard Are you sure?
__Penny Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?
__Leonard No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.
__Penny Uh, the couch is good.
__Sheldon Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.
__Leonard Let me guess, you have a problem with this.
__Sheldon Where do I begin?
__Leonard It's up to you, crazy person's choice.
__Sheldon Well first, we don't have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I'd ask you to leave.
__Leonard Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?
__Sheldon Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.
__Leonard I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?
__Sheldon No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.
__Leonard Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.
__Penny Hu.. what?
__Sheldon He's engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it.
__Leonard I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.
__Sheldon Okay, well since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.
__Penny How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
__Sheldon I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
__Leonard Here you go.
__Penny Thanks Leonard.
__Sheldon Hmmph, wrong.
__Penny I'm listening.
__Sheldon Your head goes on the other end.
__Penny Why?
__Sheldon It's culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.
__Penny I'll risk it.
__Sheldon Hm!
__Penny Anything else I should know.
__Sheldon Yes. If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
__Leonard Sorry about that.
__Penny That's okay.
__Leonard FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.
__Penny Got it.
__Leonard Well, sleep tight.
__Leonard Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight.
__Sheldon Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.
__Leonard Penny's still sleeping.
__Sheldon Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal….
__Leonard I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?
__Sheldon Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.
__Penny Uh, what time is it?
__Leonard Almost 6:30.
__Penny I slept all day?
__Leonard Oh, no, it's 6:30 in the morning.
__Penny What the hell is your problem?
__Sheldon Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.
__Howard Ola, nerd-migos.
__Penny Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
__Howard Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned.
__Penny That's okay, keep it. Where's Christie.
__Howard In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won't.
__Penny Y-you used my loofah?
__Howard More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!
__Howard Ah, well then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.
__Christie Howard?
__Howard In here my lady.
__Christie Mmmm, there's my little engine that could.
__Sheldon Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
__Christie Hi, Christie.
__Leonard Leonard.
__Sheldon I'm Sheldon.
__Christie Right, you're Howard's entourage.
__Penny Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?
__Christie Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverley Hills.
__Penny Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's… a little crowded.
__Leonard Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.
__Sheldon Oh, terrific, now we're running a cute little B&B.
__Howard Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christie stay with me.
__Leonard For one thing you live with your mother.
__Howard I do not, my mother lives with me.
__Sheldon Well then, it's all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
__Leonard Sheldon you just can't dictate…
__Howard So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz?
__Christie What is that, like a Mexican deli?
__Howard I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.
__Christie Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!
__Sheldon I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers.
__Christie But you're still taking me shopping, right?
__Howard Anything you want.
__Christie Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.
__Howard When they perfect human cloning I'm going to order twelve of those.
__Leonard Howard, can't you see she's using you?
__Howard Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!
__Penny Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
__Howard Really?
__Penny Yeah.
__Howard Yay! If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash.
__Leonard We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
__Sheldon Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?
__Leonard I see a problem.
__Sheldon Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
__Leonard So, we'll just order three entrees.
__Sheldon Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling.
__Raj We could cut it into thirds.
__Sheldon Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.
__Sheldon He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, that's punishable by death.
__Waiter I come from Sacramento.
__Leonard Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.
__Waiter No substitutions.
__Leonard This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction.
__Waiter Okay, no reductions.
__Leonard Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four.
__Raj That works.
__Sheldon No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree.
__Waiter No eliminations.
__Leonard If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.
__Sheldon And divide it how, I'm telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
__Leonard Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.
__Sheldon Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.
__Leonard We don't order egg rolls.
__Sheldon Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.
__Raj Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.
__Leonard Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.
__Sheldon No.
__Raj Uurgh.
__Waiter You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.
__Sheldon I'll know.
__Raj How about soup?
__Leonard Yeah, we can always divide soup.
__Sheldon What about the won-tons?
__Sheldon It's Halo night.
__Penny Yeah. Okay. So?
__Leonard Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,
__Penny She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.
__Leonard Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?
__Sheldon Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honour this is.
__Sheldon You can't go out, it's Halo night.
__Penny Well, for Penny it's dancing night.
__Sheldon You go dancing every Wednesday.
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Then it's not dancing night.
__Penny Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?
__Sheldon Tonight is Halo night, it's like talking to a wall.
__Penny Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.
__Leonard Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
__Sheldon Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.
__Penny Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.
__Leonard Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
__Sheldon Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.
__Leonard So?
__Leonard Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.
__Sheldon Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.
__Leonard No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you.
__Raj What's happening to us? We're falling apart.
__Sheldon The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
__Howard We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex.
__Christie You're not going to put that on your message are you?
__Howard No, I'm just kidding, I'll re-record it.
__Sheldon No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.
__Leonard You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.
__Sheldon My point.
__Christie I'm just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?
__Howard Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground.
__Christie and Howard's Mother together Christie and Howard' Shut up Howard.
__Howard You girl's talk, I'm going to take my scooter out for a little spin.
__Christie Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Why don't you stop butting in where you don't belong.
__Howard What are you guys doing here?
__Sheldon It's Halo night.
__Howard's Mother Howard' He's not a man, he's a putz, and don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger.
__Christie What did you call me?
__Howard's Mother Howard' You heard me, and I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you're around, Howard is out of the will.
__Christie You know what, I got better offers, I'm out of here.
__Howard's Mother Howard' That's right, go back to Babylon, you whore.
__Howard So, Halo night, huh?
__Raj I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
__Sheldon Shhh!
__Leonard Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.
__Raj I can't see him.
__Sheldon That's why the call it cloaking, dead man.
__Leonard Well then start throwing grenades.
__Raj I'm all out.
__Penny Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.
__Leonard That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.
__Sheldon We said no tanks.
__Raj There are no rules in hell!
__Howard Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!
__Penny Told yah!
__Leonard There's a sniper, use your rocket launcher.
__Raj All I've got is a needler, and I'm all out of ammo.
__Sheldon And now you're out of life. Why did you hit pause?
__Leonard I thought I heard something.
__Raj What?
__Leonard No, never mind, alright, go.
__Leonard Problem?
__Sheldon The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it's a nightmare.
__Leonard Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?
__Sheldon It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five.
__Leonard Why?
__Sheldon It says keep this on your person at all times.  It's right here under Batman's signature.
__ Leonard opens door. Raj and Howard are outside. Raj is holding a laptop which is open. His parents are on the screen.
__ And this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
__Raj May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali.
__Leonard Hi.
__Dr Koothrappali Lift up the camera. I'm looking at his crotch.
__Raj Sorry papa.
__Dr Koothrappali Oh, there's much better. Hi.
__Leonard Hi!
__Raj And over here is Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hi.
__Raj He lives with Leonard.
__Mrs Koothrappali Oh, that's nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer.
__Raj No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer.
__Mrs Koothrappali Such sweet young men, they just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby.
__Dr Koothrappali So are you boys academics like our son?
__Together Yes.
__Dr Koothrappali And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?
__Together Not at all.
__Raj Papa, please don't start.
__Dr Koothrappali God, it's just a question, he's so sensitive.
__Raj Okay, that's my life, that's my friends, good to see you, say goodbye.
__Together Bye!
__Dr Koothrappali Wait, wait. Before you go we have good news. Put the computer down and gather your friends.
__Raj What is it papa.
__Dr Koothrappali Friends.
__Howard Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless.
__Mrs Koothrappali Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?
__Raj The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
__Mrs Koothrappali Yes. Well, now she's a dental student at USC, so we gave her your contact information.
__Raj Why did you do that?
__Dr Koothrappali You're 26 years old Rajesh. We want grandchildren.
__Raj But Papa, I'm not supposed…
__Mrs Koothrappali Lalita's parents approve the match.
__Dr Koothrappali If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season.
__Raj Spring wedding?
__Mrs Koothrappali It's up to you dear, we don't want to meddle.
__Raj If you don't want to meddle, then why are you meddling.
__Sheldon If I may, your parents probably don't consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children's lives.
__Raj Why are you telling me about my own culture?
__Sheldon You seemed confused.
__Raj Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can't go through…
__Mrs Koothrappali Sorry darling, we have to go. Doogie Howser is on. Grandma, it's Doogie time! Bye bye.
__Dr Koothrappali Bye bye.
__Raj I don't believe it.
__Howard Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like, twenty years.
__Leonard Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programmes in India.
__Sheldon It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one's children enter the medical profession.
__Leonard I bet you're right.
__Howard I bet they love Scrubs.
__Sheldon What's not to love?
__Raj Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?
__Sheldon I suggest you go through with it.
__Raj What?
__Sheldon Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.
__Howard It's the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.
__Leonard I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show.
__Howard Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally.
__Sheldon Understandable, but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.
__Howard Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.
__Raj Okay, I know what I'm going to do.
__Leonard What?
__Raj Find new friends.
__Howard So who wants to rent Fiddler?
__Sheldon No need, we have the special edition.
__Leonard Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer.
__ Credits sequence
__Raj Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.
__Leonard Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.
__Raj I've got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.
__Lalita Lalita (voice from Raj's phone): Hi Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta. Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So I'm calling you, and, ah… call me back. Bye.
__Raj Can you believe how pushy she is?
__Leonard So don't call her.
__Raj If I don't call her, I won't hear the end of it from my parents.
__Leonard So call her.
__Raj How can I call her, you know I can't talk to women.
__Leonard I'm done, anybody else?
__Howard Give me the phone.
__Raj Why?
__Howard Just give it to me.
__Raj What are you doing?
__Howard Don't worry, you'll thank me.  Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali.  Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe.  You may now thank me.
__Raj For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character?
__Howard Fine, next time make your own date.
__Raj I didn't want to make this one.
__Leonard Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.
__Raj Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her, and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.
__Howard Worked for my parents.
__Penny Hi guys.
__Leonard Oh, hey.
__Penny I need some guinea pigs.
__Sheldon Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
__Penny I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of talking to you.
__Leonard His mom's been saying that for years. What's up?
__Penny Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks.
__Leonard Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.
__Sheldon With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example.
__Penny So Leonard, how about it?
__Leonard Look, Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn't drink, so…  Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking.
__Leonard Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.
__Penny Okay, Raj, what'll it be? (Raj whispers in Leonard's ear.)
__Leonard Whatever you recommend.
__Penny Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?
__Sheldon I'll have a diet coke.
__Penny Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.
__Sheldon Fine. I'll have a virgin cuba libre.
__Penny That's, um, rum and coke without the rum.
__Sheldon Yes,
__Penny So coke.
__Sheldon Yes. And would you make it diet?
__Penny There's a can in the fridge.
__Sheldon A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
__Penny Then swim to Cuba.
__Sheldon Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
__Penny Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who's next?
__Howard I'd like to try a slippery nipple.
__Penny Okay, you're cut off. Anybody need a refill?
__Raj Where did my life go, Penny? One day I'm a carefree batchelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
__Penny A… are you talking to me?
__Raj Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course.
__Raj Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it's time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.
__Penny Okay, sweetie, I think that's the grasshopper talking.
__Raj And it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.
__Penny Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don't you just meet this girl and, see what happens.
__Raj Haven't you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.
__Leonard Um… Raj.
__Howard No, no, let's see how long it takes him.
__Penny Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women but… you've been talking to me.
__Sheldon And now we'll never know.
__Raj You're right. I… I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?
__Penny I'm fine.
__Raj Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It's a sweet green miracle.
__Penny Okay, if you're going to drink on this date just promise me you won't overdo it.
__Raj Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
__Penny Yeah, that. Uh, why don't you bring her to my restaurant when I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?
__Raj Okay.
__Leonard Wait a minute, what's the plan here? Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?
__Howard Worked for my parents.
__Lalita Well, you are.
__Raj Little Lalita. That's kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it.
__Lalita No, it's okay.
__Raj You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?
__Lalita Yes, I do.
__Raj Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
__Lalita Well, I've been trying.
__Raj So you're a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you're still winning.
__Lalita Yay me!
__Leonard You have a drink that'll make him less obnoxious?
__Penny Drinks do not work that way.
__Howard I'd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail.
__Sheldon Sorry I'm late.
__Leonard What happened?
__Sheldon Nothing, I just really didn't want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.
__Penny Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.
__Sheldon So, how's Koothrappali d…. oh my Lord.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon That's Princess Punchali.
__Leonard I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.
__Sheldon No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.
__Howard Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.
__Sheldon It's a children's story.
__Howard Oh, no it isn't.
__Sheldon When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.
__Penny I know the reason.
__Leonard We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?
__Sheldon That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
__Howard Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but…
__Raj Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great, she isn't fat any more!
__Sheldon Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.
__Lalita I'm sorry?
__Sheldon You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.
__Lalita Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?
__Sheldon A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.
__Lalita Oh. Us Indian, or “come to our casino” Indian?
__Sheldon You Indian.
__Lalita Oh.
__Sheldon The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
__Lalita Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.
__Sheldon I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
__Lalita Really, so do I.
__Raj But you're a dentist, he's nuts.
__Lalita Don't be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.
__Sheldon It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.
__Lalita Oh my.
__Sheldon What?
__Raj If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
__Sheldon I'm not hitting on her.
__Lalita And I am not your lady.
__Howard And you have no wrath.
__Raj You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
__Lalita Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.
__Raj Oh, screw Princess Punchali.
__Lalita Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
__Raj But you're not Princess Punchali.
__Sheldon Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.
__Lalita Sheldon, are you hungry?
__Sheldon I could eat.
__Lalita Let's go.
__Raj What just happened?
__Leonard Beats the hell out of me.
__Howard I'll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks.
__Dr Koothrappali I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at him.
__Raj Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa.
__Dr Koothrappali Oh, now you're a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man.
__Leonard Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.
__Dr Koothrappali This is a family matter Sheldon.
__Leonard No, I'm Leonard.
__Dr Koothrappali Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us.
__Raj But he's right, Papa, listen to him.  You! You are the one who ruined everything!
__Mrs Koothrappali Who is it? We can't see.
__Dr Koothrappali Turn us, turn us.
__Raj Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.
__Sheldon How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?
__Raj This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
__Mrs Koothrappali You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren't you Rajesh.
__Raj Yes Mommy.
__Mrs Koothrappali Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.
__Sheldon What did I do?
__Leonard You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other.
__Sheldon Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.
__Raj Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?
__Leonard Take it, Raj. It's more than I've ever gotten.
__Sheldon And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.
__Dr Koothrappali Drunk?
__Sheldon And boring, her words.
__Dr Koothrappali I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic.
__Raj I'm not an alcoholic.
__Dr Koothrappali Then why were you drunk?
__Raj It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.
__Dr Koothrappali Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention?
__Mrs Koothrappali Don't embarrass him in front of his friends.
__Dr Koothrappali Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private.
__Raj But Papa, please….
__Dr Koothrappali Now, Rajesh.
__Raj I have to go.
__Dr Koothrappali Now listen to me….
__Raj Please wait until I get into the hall.
__Sheldon Okay, well, good night.
__Leonard Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
__Sheldon We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn't already know, and I came home.
__Leonard So you're not going to see her again?
__Sheldon Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist.
__Leonard I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren.
__Penny Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.
__Leonard You didn't?
__Penny Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.
__Howard Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this  lamp.
__Sheldon Look at me, look at me, I've got goosebumps.
__Howard Are we ready on the stereo?
__Raj Go for stereo.
__ Hey guys.
__All Hello.
__Penny It's a little loud.
__Howard No problem, turning it down.  San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax  et voila.
__Penny Okay, thanks.
__Penny Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.
__Sheldon No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.
__Penny Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they're really cheap.
__Leonard No, no, no, you don't get it, um, Howard, enable public access.
__Howard Public access enabled.
__Penny Boy, that's brilliant, but I'll see you.
__Leonard No, hang on, hang on.  See!
__Penny No.
__Penny Huh, well that's handy. Um, here's a question, why?
__All together Because we can.
__Sheldon They found the remote controlled cars.
__Penny Well, wait, wait, what's on top of them.
__Leonard Wireless webcams, wave hello.
__Howard The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
__Sheldon You may want to put on slacks.
__Penny What?  Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone.
__Leonard Who's running the red Corvette?
__Howard That would be me.
__ Credits sequence
__Raj I don't want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.
__Howard I'm with you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. I promised my mother.
__Raj I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.
__Sheldon Not to mention you'd have to power down on Saturdays.
__Leonard Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
__Sheldon Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.
__Leonard It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
__Leonard Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.
__Sheldon Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn't recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.
__Howard I don't know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary.
__Leonard Forget the parties.
__Howard Forget the parties? What a nerd.
__Leonard Are there any other honours I've gotten that I don't know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
__Sheldon Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.
__Raj Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.”
__Howard I've got one, hey Leonard, your mamma's research methodology is so flawed….
__Leonard Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.
__Sheldon No we don't. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional.
__Leonard Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.
__Sheldon You can't. I'm the lead author.
__Leonard Oh, come on. The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.
__Sheldon I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You're welcome.
__Leonard Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.
__Sheldon It doesn't need proving.
__Leonard So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
__Sheldon They're not supposed to, but they should.
__Leonard Alright, I don't care what you say, I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.
__Sheldon And I forbid it.
__Leonard You forbid it?
__Sheldon If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.
__Leonard Oh, you admit that it's our work.
__Sheldon No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.
__Leonard Ah!
__Howard Oh no he dit'nt!
__Leonard Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put's fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy!”
__Penny Oh, hey, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits!
__Leonard They don't, that's why I saved this one.
__Penny Okay, well, let's just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.
__Leonard Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
__Penny No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.
__Leonard Oh.
__Penny Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone. What's this.
__Leonard Oh, that's the bottled city of Kandor.
__Penny Uh-huh.
__Leonard You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.
__Penny Oh, nice.
__Leonard It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
__Penny Here, why don't you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.
__Leonard Great, be right back.
__Penny Well, where you going, just put them on.
__Leonard Here?
__Penny Oh, are you shy?
__Leonard No, I'm not shy.
__Penny Don't worry, I won't look.
__Leonard I know you won't look, why would you look, there's nothing to see, well, not nothing….
__Penny Sweetie, put the pants on.
__Leonard Putting them on.
__Penny So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.
__Leonard No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.
__Penny What is this?
__Leonard Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.
__Penny Oh, why didn't you wear it at Halloween?
__Leonard Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
__Penny Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.
__Leonard Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.
__Leonard Ah. Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible. So it works as two.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?
__Penny The… the eighth grade?
__Leonard My last growth spurt.
__Penny Okay, well, I guess we're back to the corduroy suit.
__Leonard Great.
__Penny Yup.  I said no, put it down.
__Sheldon Hello Penny.
__Penny Get anything good?
__Sheldon Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
__Penny Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't.  It was a joke.  Yup, tip your waitresses, I'm here all week.
__Sheldon Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.
__Penny Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard…
__Sheldon Oh dear God!
__Penny Little misunderstanding, huh.
__Sheldon A little misunder…. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
__Penny Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.
__Sheldon Huh.
__Penny Well how do you feel?
__Sheldon I don't understand the question.
__Penny Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
__Sheldon Oh. I hadn't thought about it like that. I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.
__Penny Wait… what?
__Sheldon I couldn't poop this morning.
__Penny You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out.
__Sheldon It's certainly preferable to my plan.
__Penny Which was?
__Sheldon A powerful laxative.
__Penny Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.
__Penny Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but…
__Sheldon Of course you didn't, he said little idea?
__Penny Uh, well no, no, not in… not in those words.
__Sheldon In what words then, exactly
__Penny Um, gee, the exact words aren't written… it's more the spirit in which it's
__Sheldon What did he say?
__Penny You had a lucky hunch.
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don't….
__Sheldon Don't you ever speak to me again.
__Leonard What…
__Penny Uh, he… (makes “he's screwy” hand movements, turns to go).
__Sheldon Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.
__Leonard Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.
__Sheldon Then why did you say it.
__Leonard I don't know, I wasn't choosing my…
__Sheldon Were you trying to impress Penny?
__Leonard No, no not at all. A little bit.
__Sheldon How'd that work out for you?
__Penny Leonard, ready to go?
__Sheldon Libido 1, truth zero.
__Leonard Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.
__Sheldon And I'm telling you for the last time it's pandering, it's undignified and bite me.
__Leonard Let's go.
__Penny Bye Sheldon.
__Sheldon Goodbye Penny. (Places fingers to head to try to make Leonard's brain explode. Leonard leaves.) Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!
__Howard I just checked the house, there's probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.
__Leonard You're kidding.
__Penny Is that all?
__Leonard All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.
__Penny Oh, well, then good!
__Leonard I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm a little nervous.
__Leonard A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there's this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won't lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right?
__Penny Oh, sorry, I've just, I've heard it before.
__Howard Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.
__Leonard It's a classic, right?
__Voice Yeah. What the hell was that?
__Leonard Any other questions?
__Sheldon Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper.  Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero.
__Leonard I didn't skip it, it's just an anecdote. It's not science.
__Sheldon Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton's head, was that just an anecdote?
__Leonard You are not Isaac Newton.
__Sheldon No, no that's true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.
__Leonard You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
__Sheldon You continue to underestimate me, my good man.
__Leonard Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.
__Sheldon As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offence.
__Leonard Really, so why did you come?
__Sheldon Because I knew you'd screw this up.
__Leonard I didn't screw it up.
__Sheldon Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.
__Leonard I've had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.
__Sheldon So you admit that you're an egotist?
__Leonard Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he's worse.
__Sheldon Okay, that is it.
__Leonard You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
__Sheldon Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
__Leonard Stop it.
__Sheldon You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.
__Leonard You were trying to blow up my head.
__Sheldon So it was working.
__Leonard It wasn't, it was not, you are a nutcase.
__Sheldon Oh we'll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone.
__Leonard Stop, stop it, quit it.
__Penny Is this usually how these physics things go?
__Howard More often than you'd think.
__Leonard Vulcan nerve pinch!
__Leonard You're lucky I didn't run you over.
__Sheldon I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there's just no pleasing you.
__Sheldon Well that's not much of an apology, but I'll take it.
__Leonard Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologise for?
__Sheldon Yes. I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.
__Howard You won't believe this.
__Raj Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Now, who would do that?
__Howard That would be me. Hey, check it out, it's a featured video.
__Sheldon Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.
__Penny Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned “Me and my Girlfriend?”
__Howard Uh-oh, here comes “the talk.”
__ Penny tries to make Howard's brain explode.
__Student two Yeah. Gigantic American geeks.
__Student one Who's doing that?
__Student two Someone from Pasadena, California named… “Wolowizard.”
__Together Awesome!
__Sheldon Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?
__Leonard Skynet is kinky? I don't know.
__Sheldon Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
__Leonard Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…
__Sheldon , too late, I win.
__Penny Let's go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.
__Leonard What the hell is that?
__Sheldon I don't know, but if cats could sing, they'd hate it too.
__Penny You wanna prowl, be my night owl,  we'll take my…  Hey guys, hi! Where you going?
__Leonard What? Oh we just had to… mail some letters and  throw away some chicken.
__Penny You'll never guess what just happened.
__Leonard Oh, I give up.
__Sheldon I don't guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
__Penny What was that?
__Leonard Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?
__Penny Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?
__Sheldon I have a conclusion based on an observation.
__Leonard No you don't. No he doesn't.
__Penny Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.
__Leonard Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.
__Penny It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.
__Sheldon I think I know.
__Leonard No you don't. He doesn't.
__Penny It's this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?
__Together No.
__Leonard Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.
__Sheldon I think that's a week from Tuesday at six.
__Leonard No, it's this Friday, at eight.
__Penny Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.
__Leonard See you.
__Sheldon You just lied to Penny.
__Leonard Yes, I did.
__Sheldon And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.
__Leonard So?
__Leonard Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.
__Sheldon No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you'd have done it a long time ago.
__Leonard That's very true.
__ Leonard exits. Sheldon looks worried for a moment, then retrieves the chicken from the bin and follows.
__ Credits sequence
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I need to speak to you.
__Leonard It's two o'clock in the morning
__Sheldon It's important.
__Leonard I highly doubt that. Go away.  Are you still out there?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon You're right, it can wait until morning.
__Leonard What, what, what, what, what?
__Sheldon Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you're in no state to talk.
__Leonard Sheldon, what is it?
__Sheldon I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
__Leonard What was I supposed to say.
__Sheldon You could have told her the truth.
__Sheldon Is that a relevant factor?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
__Leonard And what would I have said afterwards?
__Sheldon I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.
__Leonard I couldn't say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.
__Leonard It's the social protocol, it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.
__Sheldon I was not aware of that.
__Leonard Well now you are.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight.
__Leonard Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?
__Sheldon I was analysing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.
__Sheldon Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.
__ Leonard closes door.
__ Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
__Penny Do you have any idea what time it is?
__Sheldon Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.
__Penny What do you want?
__Sheldon Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
__Penny I remember symposium.
__Sheldon Yes, well, he lied.
__Penny Wait, what?
__Sheldon He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.
__Sheldon Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit.
__Sheldon To help you.
__Leonard I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.
__Sheldon She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.
__Leonard Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.
__Sheldon Hunger? Indigestion, I'm sorry I'm really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.
__Leonard Your cousin Leopold?
__Sheldon Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it's important.
__Leonard What's important?
__Sheldon Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.
__Leonard Do you have a cousin Leopold.
__Leonard I don't get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?
__Sheldon Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.
__Leonard Un-unravelable?
__Sheldon Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.
__Sheldon Ah, because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive.
__Leonard We're going to Long Beach?
__Sheldon No, of course not, there's no cousin Leo, there's no intervention, focus Leonard.
__Leonard Oh, come on!
__Sheldon We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.
__Sheldon Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.
__Leonard You still told her I lied.
__Sheldon For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
__Leonard I don't know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
__Sheldon That's the best part, you don't have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.
__Leonard So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?
__Sheldon Un-unravelable.
__Penny Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.
__Leonard Oh, well, thankyou.
__Penny You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to.
__Leonard I don't know what to say.
__Penny It's okay, Leonard
__Leonard Oh, okay, alright, good.
__Howard Oh boy, group hug.
__Penny Uh-huh!
__Howard Uh-huh?
__Penny Uh-huh!
__Howard Okay. So what's up?
__Sheldon Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.
__Howard Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you're Bogarding the symposium.
__Leonard Howard, I'm sorry… we're… we're
__Howard No, no, you're quark-blocking us.
__Leonard I don't know what to say.
__Howard Wow.
__Leonard Howard, listen…
__Howard No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.
__Penny Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.
__Sheldon Okay, sure. I don't see a problem with that.
__Penny There's no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn't that right Leonard.
__Leonard Well… I don't know what to say.
__Penny It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm…ian
__Sheldon Good for you.
__Penny Hah, yeah! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.
__Howard No, I'm lost too, I think she skipped a step.
__Penny No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man.
__Penny Alright you guys, good luck.
__Leonard Thanks Penny.
__Howard Yeah, uh, break a leg.
__Sheldon Break a leg.
__Howard So, road trip to Long Beach.
__Leonard No, we're not going to Long Beach.
__Raj Why not?
__Leonard Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
__Raj Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.
__Raj Sounds fun.
__Howard I'm game.
__Raj Shotgun.
__Sheldon No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.
__Leonard Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?
__Leonard Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.
__Sheldon No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.
__Leonard What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over.
__Sheldon Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.
__Leonard Why not?
__Sheldon Because Leo is a middle child.
__Leonard There is no Leo, how can you say that?
__Sheldon You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he's the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.
__Leonard I've got a solution.
__Sheldon Great, what is it?
__Leonard Get out.
__Sheldon Fine.  I've hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I'm just trying to clean up after your mess.  We'll talk in the morning.
__Leonard Who are you?
__Leonard Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.
__Man Au contraire. I'm 26 years old, I'm originally from  Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I've often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.
__Sheldon Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.
__Man Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.
__Sheldon For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.
__Leonard Sheldon?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.
__Toby It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.
__Leonard Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?
__Sheldon Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.
__Leonard Oh…!
__Toby Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.
__Sheldon No. We're going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.
__Toby Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?
__Sheldon Subtextually, of course.  Just have fun with it.  Morning Penny.
__Penny Hi. How did the intervention go.
__Sheldon Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.
__Penny Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.
__Sheldon But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.
__Penny Hi Leo, how are you feeling?
__Toby Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?
__Penny No.
__Toby Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.
__Leonard Well, that's Leo. Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?
__Penny Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn't a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.
__Leonard There were only two people there?
__Penny By the end. Yeah.
__Toby Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!
__Penny I'm… I'm sorry.
__Toby The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.
__Sheldon Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
__Toby That's never been proven.
__Sheldon There have been studies.
__Toby Not double blind studies.
__Sheldon How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group.
__Leonard As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let's give them some privacy.
__Penny Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?
__Leonard Sounds good.
__Penny I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?
__Leonard Gee, why wouldn't I?
__Penny This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.
__Leonard Yeah! Funny how things work out.
__Toby And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.
__Sheldon Your parents made the right decision.
__Toby I cannot work like this!
__Penny Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You're gonna do okay.
__Toby One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time.
__Leonard How long is he going to stay here.
__Sheldon He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
__Leonard O-o-o-o-h! Again?
__Sheldon Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed.
__Leonard Just reset the board.
__Sheldon It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
__Leonard Hey!
__Penny Did you get my mail.
__Leonard Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?
__Sheldon From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
__Penny Boy, it's good to be back.
__Leonard How was your family?
__Penny Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.
__Sheldon Sick?
__Leonard Here we go.
__Sheldon What kind of sick?
__Penny Oh, the flu I guess.
__Sheldon I don't need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?
__Penny Maybe Friday.
__Sheldon Friday, was that morning or afternoon?
__Sheldon Think woman, who blew their nose and when?
__Leonard Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.
__Sheldon Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.
__Leonard Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon, he's a bit of a germophobe.
__Penny Oh, it's okay, I understand.
__Sheldon Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.
__Leonard You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
__Leonard No problem. Welcome home.
__Sheldon What?
__ Credits sequence
__Sheldon I'm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.
__Leonard With lime jello?
__Sheldon I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.
__Leonard I don't think so.
__Sheldon Leonard! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat.
__Leonard Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.
__Sheldon We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.
__Leonard Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?
__Sheldon When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.
__Leonard I'm going back to bed.
__Sheldon Wait.  Put this in the bathroom.
__Leonard What for?
__Sheldon I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.
__Leonard I mix pancake batter in this!
__Sheldon No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.
__Leonard You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?
__Sheldon It's right here on the bottom.
__Leonard Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.
__ Cut to Leonard entering living room in panic, stumbling and trying to put on a pair of trousers.
__ Leonard! Leonard I'm sick!
__ Leonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.
__ Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard?  Ow!
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Leonard, where are you?
__Leonard I'm at work.
__Sheldon At six-thirty in the morning?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon On Sunday?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Why?
__Leonard They asked me to come in.
__Sheldon Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.
__Leonard They texted me.
__Sheldon Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.
__Leonard No kidding?
__Sheldon No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.
__Leonard Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
__Sheldon What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
__Leonard Drink whatever you want.
__Sheldon I want soup.
__Leonard Then make soup.
__Sheldon We don't have soup.
__Leonard I'm at work, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Is that a dog?
__Leonard Yes,
__Sheldon In the lab?
__Leonard Yes, they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.
__Howard I know it's the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Well who's calling at this ungodly hour?
__Howard I don't know.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour.
__Howard How can I ask them when I'm talking to you!  Hello.
__Leonard Howard, it's Leonard, code Milky Green.
__Howard Dear Lord, not Milky Green!
__Leonard Affirmative, with fever.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Who's on the phone.
__Howard It's Leonard.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Why is he calling.
__Howard Sheldon's sick.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Were you playing with him?
__Howard For God's sake, Ma, I'm twenty six years old.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.
__Howard Chocolate milk and eggoes please!
__Leonard Howard, listen to me.
__Howard Hang on, call waiting.
__Leonard No, don't, don't….
__Howard Hello.
__Sheldon Howard, I'm sick.
__Howard Howard (imitating his mother's voice): Howard's sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?
__Sheldon I need soup.
__Howard Then call your own mother.  It was Sheldon.
__Howard It's my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of '06.
__Leonard You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.
__Howard Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?
__Howard's Mother Howard' I just had the carpets steamed.
__Howard That's a negatory. But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.
__Leonard Five movies, two hours apiece. It's a start.
__Penny No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?
__Sheldon I'm sick, thank you very much.
__Penny How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick.
__Sheldon You're a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You're doomed!
__Penny Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.
__Sheldon I want soup.
__Penny Penny (over Sheldon's strange throat clearance): Why didn't you just….  Why didn't you just have soup at home.
__Sheldon Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?
__Penny You can have soup delivered.
__Sheldon I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.
__Penny Okay, what kind of soup do you want.
__Sheldon Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.
__Penny We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.
__Sheldon Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Then surprise me.  Would you call that moss green or forest green?
__Raj Well I'd like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down.
__Leonard Oh, hi Penny!
__Penny Hey, where are you?
__Leonard I'm… uh… at work.
__Penny You sound funny.
__Leonard I'm… uh… in a… I'm in a radiation suit. What's up?
__Penny Yeah, well I'm at work too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.
__Leonard Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.  Just tell him to go home.
__Penny He won't leave, he says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.
__Leonard He's paranoid, and he's established a nest.
__Penny Can you please come get him?
__Leonard Uh, yeah, I'd be… I'd be happy to Penny.  Oh my God there's a breech in the radiation unit  The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye!  I feel really guilty.
__Raj You did what you had to do. (Steals some of Howard's popcorn)
__Howard Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.
__Penny Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.
__Sheldon Good. Good.
__Penny Okay, well, you feel better.
__Sheldon Wait, where are you going?
__Penny Um, home, to write some bad cheques.
__Sheldon You're going to leave me?
__Penny Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?
__Sheldon Well, of course, but, not by myself.
__Penny Really, never?
__Sheldon Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.
__Penny Studying abroad?
__Sheldon No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.
__Penny And there was no-one there to take care of you?
__Sheldon No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.
__Penny Again?
__Sheldon It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”
__Penny What does that mean?
__Sheldon Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”
__Penny Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?
__Sheldon Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.
__Penny Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.
__Sheldon Agreed.
__Leonard Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I'm blind here guys, can you help me find them?
__Howard Sorry.  Found ‘em.
__Leonard Oh great.
__Howard Sorry, don't you have a spare.
__Leonard Yeah, at home.
__Raj Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.
__Howard Unless Sheldon's there, in which case you'll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.
__Leonard Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye.  He's home, I'm screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.
__Raj How about Lasic?
__Leonard You want me to get eye surgery?
__Raj Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?
__Howard Well?
__Leonard I'm thinking!
__Sheldon Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.
__Penny Oh, Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?
__Sheldon Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.
__Penny But Sheldon….
__Sheldon Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
__Penny I can't believe I'm doing this.
__Sheldon No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.
__Penny Sorry.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
__Penny I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
__Sheldon I'll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you.
__Penny Soft kitty, warm kitty…
__Sheldon Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.
__Penny Little ball of fur.
__Raj The living room appears to be empty.
__Leonard Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.
__Leonard Raj?
__Raj No way, Jose.
__Leonard Well I can't do it, I can't see anything.
__Howard It's all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We'll be your eyes.
__Leonard Fine.
__Howard One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.
__Leonard Won't my footsteps set it off?
__Howard No, you'll be on your hands and knees. Now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room.
__Leonard Well, how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?
__ Cut to Leonard entering apartment on hands and knees, carrying the sensor in his teeth.
__ Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.
__Leonard What?
__Howard It means go straight.
__Howard You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings, you say keep true.
__Leonard Alright  I just hit my head.
__Howard Because you didn't keep true.  Okay, turn right.
__Raj The… the picture's breaking up.
__Howard Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more.  That's it, now just keep true. Alright, you're close enough to Sheldon's room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.
__Leonard It wasn't on?
__Howard No.
__Leonard Then why did I have to crawl?
__Leonard Okay, it's on.
__Howard Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.
__Leonard I know.
__Howard Hang on, the sensor's picking up something, turn your head back.
__Penny You rat bastard.
__Howard Told you the sensor would work.
__Penny You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.
__Leonard Well, I had to, you see what he's like.
__Sheldon Penny! Penny, I'm hungry.
__Penny Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!
__Leonard No!
__Penny Here you go, good luck, bye.
__Leonard W-wait!
__Sheldon Leonard, I'm hungry!
__Leonard Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor.  Sheldon appears in his comforter.)
__ Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are on the sofa. Sheldon is wrapped in his comforter, Leonard is holding an ice-pack to his head.
__ Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
__Leonard I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.
__Sheldon I'm very congested.
__Leonard Yeah, so?
__Sheldon Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.
__Leonard If I stand, I'll vomit.
__Sheldon Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.
__Leonard Lay it on me.
__Sheldon Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.
__Leonard How about that.
__Sheldon Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.
__Leonard Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
__Sheldon No, he would be exactly the same.
__Leonard That is a problem.
__Sheldon So, you see it too.
__Dr Gablehouser Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.
__Together Dr Gablehouser.
__Gablehouser Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we're hoping to have him do his graduate work here.
__Leonard Graduate work, very impressive.
__Gablehouser And he's only fifteen years old.
__Dennis Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea.
__Leonard Advantage Kim.
__Gablehouser I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.
__Dennis I already know you're not. You don't have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.
__Sheldon Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.
__Dennis Well, obviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will.
__Gablehouser Dennis, we discussed this, we're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we've agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.
__Leonard Yes sir.
__Sheldon You can count on us, we're on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.
__Dennis I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition… ooh, look, chocolate milk.
__Sheldon I sense a disturbance in the force.
__ Credits sequence
__Dennis A year and a half.
__Dennis So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Dennis That.
__Sheldon He's not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.
__Dennis Is this part of the tour?
__Sheldon Nope. Goodbye.
__Leonard Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.
__Sheldon Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.
__Dennis Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.
__Sheldon Keen observation, goodbye.
__Dennis You see where you went wrong, don't you?
__Sheldon Leonard.
__Leonard Huh, yeah?
__Sheldon Get him out.
__Leonard Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec centre, they've got nautilus equipment.
__Dennis It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.
__Sheldon You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it?
__Sheldon Get him out Leonard.
__Leonard Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab.
__Dennis Wow, you won the Stephenson award.
__Sheldon Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.
__Dennis Really, how old?
__Sheldon Fourteen and a half.
__Dennis You were the youngest person ever to win it.
__Leonard It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?
__Howard Hey, I'm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?
__Penny Sure. Raj, hug Howard.
__Sheldon Uh-uh-uh.
__Leonard Something you'd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
__Sheldon Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he's already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to… you know, that other guy.
__Howard Antonio Salieri?
__Sheldon Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me.
__Howard You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.
__Leonard Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.
__Sheldon Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.
__Penny I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?
__Leonard You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
__Sheldon Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.
__Penny So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is.
__Sheldon Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything.
__Penny I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?
__Howard We liked Leonard.
__Leonard Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?
__Sheldon Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.
__Penny You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon I've decided you're right. My career is not over.
__Leonard Great.
__Sheldon But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.
__Leonard Great.
__Sheldon So I've decided, I'm going to collaborate with you.
__Leonard Great.
__Sheldon What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.
__Leonard Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help.
__Sheldon Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what's this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard It would blow up.
__Leonard Pretty sure.
__Sheldon Pretty sure's not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?
__Leonard Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.
__Sheldon Alright.
__Leonard Go away.
__Sheldon If you're concerned about sharing credit with me, you're name can go first… I'm going.
__Sheldon So, this is engineering, huh?
__Howard I'll talk to you later.
__Sheldon Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.
__Howard Sheldon, what are you doing here?
__Sheldon I just came by to say hello.
__Howard I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.
__Sheldon Well, up until now I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today?
__Howard A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle.
__Sheldon Really, how does it work?
__Howard When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.
__Sheldon Uh, huh. So it's a shelf?
__Howard No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it's a shelf.
__Sheldon Now, I notice you're using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they're lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.
__Howard Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.
__Sheldon And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.
__Howard Sheldon.
__Howard Go away.
__Sheldon Did Leonard tell you to say that?
__Howard No, I thought of it all by myself.
__Sheldon Huh. It can't be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I'm missing.
__Sheldon Curiouser and curiouser.
__Leonard If he were, I wouldn't be.
__Raj Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.
__Leonard Is that even possible?
__Raj As it turns out, yes.
__Howard Something's got to be done about him, Leonard.
__Leonard Like what? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
__Raj Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?
__Howard Then our problem would be solved.
__Leonard Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I'm not saying no.
__Howard We don't have to go that far, there are other means available.
__Raj We can't send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.
__Howard The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
__Leonard That won't happen, he's not interested in anything but physics.
__Howard What about biology?
__Leonard What?
__Howard You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.
__Leonard Howard, he's fifteen.
__Howard Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.
__Raj She was sleeping with you?
__Howard No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.
__Sheldon Oh, good, you're all here. Look, I've decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops.  Go away?  Hmm. Could it be me?
__Howard We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Howard, that's racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick.
__Raj It's possible she may have misunderstood us.
__Sheldon No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.
__Gablehouser Oh, what are you working on?
__Sheldon Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.
__Gablehouser To what end?
__Sheldon You know, it's like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.
__Gablehouser Who will come?
__Sheldon The Jewish people.
__Gablehouser What if they don't come.
__Sheldon We'll make it nice, put out a spread.
__Gablehouser Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who's agreed to join us here at the University.
__Sheldon Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can't you.
__Gablehouser Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your… uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of… um… he's nuts.
__Sheldon Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They'll come, they'll settle and I'll win the prize…
__Goldfarb Go away.
__Sheldon We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.
__Goldfarb Please go away.
__Sheldon Said Pharoah to Moses.
__Gablehouser Why are all these young women here?
__Leonard It's take your daughter to work day.
__Gablehouser Really, I was not aware of that.
__Raj Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.
__Gablehouser Hm?
__Howard Smooth.
__Raj Thank you.
__Gablehouser There's the man of the hour.
__Leonard Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.
__Howard All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.
__Leonard Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
__Raj We need a social catalyst.
__Leonard Like what? We can't get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
__Howard Or can we?
__Leonard No, we can't.
__Howard I don't think you mean we can't. I think you mean we shouldn't.
__Sheldon Hey, Howard. You're a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it's definitely me.
__Leonard Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.
__Howard Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you're in the back seat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.
__Raj Are you crying?
__Howard No, I have allergies.
__Raj Okay, uh, how about her?
__Leonard Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.
__Raj Okay, so not her either. How about her?
__Howard Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem.
__Leonard I think that's our girl. One of us should go talk to her.
__Raj I can't talk to her, you do it.
__Leonard I can't just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.
__Howard Oh no, she'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.
__Raj You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we'd be done.
__Leonard Well, we're not in India.
__Raj Alright, why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.
__Leonard Okay, that was uncalled for.
__Raj You started it, dude.
__Gablehouser Could I have everyone's attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.
__Gablehouser Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.
__Sheldon Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
__Gablehouser And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!
__Dennis What?
__Gablehouser Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.
__Dennis Um, no thanks. I'm going to the mall with Emma.
__Gablehouser Well, uh, well, uh….
__Leonard The kid got a girl.
__Raj Unbelievable.
__Howard Did anyone see how he did it?
__Sheldon Don't worry, I've got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.
__Howard He's back.
__Raj Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?
__Howard I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.
__Leonard Well, why do we go home alone every night, we're still smart.
__Raj Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's offputting.
__Howard Yeah, let's go with that.
__Leonard I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”
__Raj Hey, look at that.  It's Dennis Kim.
__Howard Wow, I almost didn't recognise him.
__Leonard Yeah, we really ruined his life.
__Sheldon Screw him, he was weak.
__Raj I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.
__Sheldon Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it's an extremely private matter.
__Leonard Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.
__Howard Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
__Raj How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose.
__Penny Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it's just going “aaaaaaa”.
__Leonard What did you spill on it?
__Penny Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.
__Leonard I'll take a look at it.
__Howard Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren't fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year.
__Leonard You're kidding, why not?
__Howard They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm.
__Penny Wow, so in your world, you're like, the cool guys.
__Howard Recognise.
__Leonard This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.
__Penny Zod?
__Howard Kryptonian villain. Long story.
__Raj Good story.
__Sheldon Well count me out.
__Howard What? Why?
__Sheldon You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
__Leonard Come on, you need a four person team, we're four people.
__Sheldon By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.
__Penny I want tickets to that please.
__Leonard Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you.
__Sheldon No, don't.
__Leonard The needs of the many.
__Howard Outweigh the needs of the few.
__Sheldon Or the one. Dammit, I'll do it.
__ Credits sequence
__Howard How about the perpetual motion squad? It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies.
__Leonard The ladies?
__Howard Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.
__Raj I like it.
__Sheldon I don't. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.
__Raj Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
__Sheldon Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.
__Raj Maybe so. But you can't incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.
__Leonard Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?
__Sheldon I will yield.
__Leonard After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?
__Sheldon He does.
__Leonard I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Of course.
__Howard Fire away.
__Penny You know, it's none of my business, but isn't a guy who can't speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?
__Leonard Oh, uh, he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice.
__Penny Oh, thanks Raj, it's vanilla oil.
__Leonard I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start.
__Sheldon And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.
__Penny That is correct.
__Leonard I knew that too.
__Penny Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.
__Sheldon And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.
__Penny Right.
__Howard Hey, I buzzed in.
__Sheldon But I answered, it's called teamwork.
__Howard Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
__Sheldon By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.
__Leonard Just ask another one.
__Sheldon And of course it's Gravity Probe B.
__Leonard Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.
__Sheldon Why?
__Penny Because it's polite.
__Sheldon What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
__Penny Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.
__Sheldon The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn't I give them?
__Howard Some of us might have the correct answers too.
__Sheldon Oh please, you don't even have a PhD.
__Howard Alright, that's it.
__Leonard Howard, sit down.
__Leonard maybe we should take a little break.
__Sheldon Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.
__Howard I agree.
__Penny What did he say?
__Howard He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.
__Penny Yeah, and the bag it came in.
__Leonard Can it wait, I need to talk to you.
__Sheldon Just look. I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold.
__Leonard Why do they say AA?
__Sheldon Army Ants.
__Leonard Isn't that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.
__Sheldon Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
__Leonard No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!
__Sheldon Oh neat, what's the occasion?
__Leonard Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you're off the team.
__Sheldon What?
__Leonard Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.
__Sheldon No you didn't.
__Leonard Yes we did, I just came from it.
__Sheldon Okay, I don't know where you just came from, but it couldn't have been a team meeting because I'm on the team and I wasn't there, ergo the team did not meet.
__Leonard Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team.
__Sheldon Why?
__Leonard Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
__Sheldon Well, I'm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?
__Leonard Okay, let me try it this way, you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.
__Sheldon I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.
__Leonard Thanks for the heads up.
__Sheldon You're welcome. One more thing.
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard He won't say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.
__Raj He's using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you.
__Leonard How exactly would that laugh go?
__Raj Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
__Howard That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians.
__Leonard Guys, let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.
__Howard So?
__Leonard So nothing, let's destroy him.
__Sheldon Gentlemen.
__Raj Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
__Howard Okay, we're going to need a strong fourth for our team.
__Raj You know who's apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV's Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.
__Leonard Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team.
__Raj How about the girl from the Wonder Years?
__Howard Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems.
__Leonard We can't ask Leslie Winkle.
__Raj Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney?
__Leonard Yes.
__Howard Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.
__Raj Yeah. Sack up, dude.
__Leonard Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.
__Leslie Hi guys.
__Leonard Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I…
__Howard Hit that thang.
__Leslie Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.
__Leslie Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.
__Leonard That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on with my question now.
__Leslie Proceed.
__Leonard We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
__Leslie No thanks, I'm really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.
__Howard Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you.
__Leslie Sorry.
__Howard Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano.
__Leslie Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?
__Howard Yes.
__Leslie That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing?
__Leonard She's in.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing.
__Penny Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting.
__Sheldon Gentlemen.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Howard Sheldon.
__Raj Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
__Penny Sheldon. I'm just going to sit down.
__Leonard So, is that your team.
__Sheldon Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?
__Leslie Hello, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Leslie Winkle?
__Leslie Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?
__Sheldon Yes, well, I'm polymerised tree sap and you're non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.
__Leslie Oh, ouch.
__Dr Gablehouser Okay, if everyone could please take your seats.
__Leonard Here's your tee-shirt. (Hands her a tee-shirt with PMS on it. Takes jacket off to reveal similar.)
__Leslie PMS? It's a couple of days early, but…
__Leonard No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.
__Leslie Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?
__Gablehouser Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year's physics bowl. Today's preliminary match features two great teams… AA versus PMS.
__Howard All night long, y'all! (Stands and turns round to reveal the back of the tee-shirt which reads “We Can Go All Night”.)
__Gablehouser Okay, well let's jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson?  PMS?
__Leonard The Eta Meson.
__Gablehouser Correct.
__Sheldon Formal protest.
__Gablehouser On what grounds?
__Sheldon The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
__Gablehouser Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope.  AA?
__Sheldon And of course, the answer is Technetium.
__Gablehouser Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation.  PMS?
__Raj Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.
__Gablehouser Correct.
__ How does a quantum computer factor large numbers.  PMS?
__Leslie Shor's Algorithm.
__Gablehouser Correct.
__ 4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
__ Prevost's theory of exchanges.
__ Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N
__ 760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.
__Gablehouser Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning.
__ A sigma particle.
__ Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth.
__Gablehouser Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation.
__Raj Holy crap.
__Leonard What the hell is that.
__Howard It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.
__Leonard Come on, think, Leslie.
__Leslie Leonard, it's not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there.
__Leonard You're never going to let that go, are you?
__Gablehouser Ten seconds.  PMS.
__Leonard Sorry, I panicked.
__Howard Then guess.
__Leonard Um, eight.  Point four.
__Gablehouser I'm sorry, that's incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours.
__Howard He doesn't have it. He's got squat.
__ AA, I need your answer.
__Third Floor Janitor The answer is minus eight by alpha.
__Sheldon Hang on, hang on a second, that's not our answer. What are you doing?
__Third Floor Janitor Answering question. Winning physics bowl.
__Sheldon How do you know anything about physics?
__Third Floor Janitor Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears.
__Sheldon Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.
__Third Floor Janitor You didn't answer question.
__Sheldon Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist.  Ow!
__Sheldon Well it's not what he said.
__Gablehouser Then what is it?
__Sheldon I want a different question.
__Gablehouser You can't have a different question.
__Sheldon Formal protest.
__Gablehouser Denied.
__Sheldon Informal protest.
__Gablehouser Denied. I need your official answer.
__Sheldon No. I decline to provide one.
__Gablehouser Well, that's too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct.
__Sheldon That's your opinion.
__Gablehouser Alright, the winner of the match is…
__Leonard Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team.
__Sheldon I don't understand the question.
__Leonard Go ahead.
__Gablehouser The winner is PMS!
__Sheldon Who?
__Leonard My Physics Bowl Trophy!
__Sheldon That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win.
__Leonard I know someone who would disagree.
__Sheldon Who?
__Leonard My Physics Bowl Trophy!  “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”
__Sheldon Alright that is very immature.
__Leonard You're right, I'm sorry. (In voice, waving trophy in Sheldon's face) I'm not!
__Penny Okay, new contest.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Penny I'm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?
__Sheldon Absolutely.
__Leonard Bring it on.
__Penny Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?  The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?
__Sheldon The Brady Bunch?
__Penny Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum.  Oh my God, Sean Penn!
__Leonard How do you know these things?
__Penny I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine's sexiest man alive?
__Sheldon William Shatner.
__Leonard Wait, I don't think it's Shatner.
__Sheldon Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Formal protest.
__Penny Alright, singer who sang “Oops I Did It Again.”  Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?
__Sheldon Romulan.
__Penny Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.
__Raj What did they give you?
__Sheldon Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.
__Leonard I don't believe it.
__Sheldon I know, it's basic culinary science.
__Leonard Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.
__Howard A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?
__Leonard No, a time machine from Sophie's Choice.
__Raj Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it's rough.
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Raj It's only $800?
__Leonard Yeah. And that's my bid.
__Sheldon You bid $800.
__Leonard It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.
__Sheldon There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
__Howard Do you have $800?
__Leonard Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
__Howard Don't worry, the way these things work there's people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it's called sniping.
__Raj Fifteen seconds.
__Leonard Come on, snipers.
__Raj Ten, nine, eight…
__Leonard Where are your snipers?
__Raj Five.
__Leonard Snipe.
__Raj Four.
__Leonard Snipe.
__Raj Three.
__Leonard Snipe!
__Raj Two.
__Leonard SNIPE!
__Raj One.
__Leonard Aaaa-aw!
__Raj Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.
__Howard You lucky duck.
__Sheldon I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.
__Leonard Yeah, I know, I still can't afford it.
__Howard Why don't we share it? We'll each put in two hundred bucks and we'll take turns having it in our homes.
__Raj A time share time machine? I'm in. Sheldon?
__Sheldon Need you ask? But I still don't understand why no-one else bid.

__Leonard I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
__Sheldon In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”.
__Howard It's actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound.
__Raj Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
__Leonard How are we going to get it upstairs?
__Howard If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.
__Leonard Yes but the elevator's been broken for two years.
__Sheldon I've been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?
__Howard Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  No, that baby's broken.
__Raj I can't feel my fingers, hurry up.
__Sheldon It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.
__Raj Sheldon?
__Raj If my fingers ever work again, I've got a job for the middle one.
__Penny Oh, hey guys.
__Leonard Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys!
__Penny What are you doing?
__Leonard Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs.
__Penny What is it?
__Leonard It's… you know, time machine.
__Penny Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….
__Leonard Uh, just give us a few minutes.
__Penny I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.
__Sheldon Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.
__Penny You're joking, right?
__Sheldon Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.
__Penny Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof.
__Leonard Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it's not… never mind.
__Sheldon For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous.
__Leonard Let's just do this. Guys, ready to push?
__Raj In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.
__Leonard Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.
__Sheldon The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.
__Howard Talk about your chick magnets.
__Raj Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!
__Sheldon Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here.
__Howard You can't just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it's at my friends house,” how lame is that?
__Raj He's got a point.
__Sheldon Alright, I think we're going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.
__Leonard Seconded.
__Howard I was going to put down a towel.
__Raj I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.
__Leonard That sounds fair.
__Sheldon Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?
__Raj Twice a month.
__Sheldon Then no.
__Raj Okay, every other month.
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Sheldon, you can't be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. (Sits and turns it on. The three lights on the front illuminate. All let out an “oh”.) Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876.
__Howard Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.
__Leonard So, when it's your turn you can.
__Raj Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
__Howard And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?”
__Raj Mrs Bell was deaf, she's not even going to hear you knock.
__Sheldon Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.
__Raj Ooh, how far into the future?
__Sheldon If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.
__Leonard Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun.
__Raj My turn.
__Penny Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.
__Leonard Are you okay?
__Penny Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.
__Leonard That doesn't sound too bad.
__Penny It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Penny Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they'd given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this… this…
__Sheldon Time machine.
__Leonard The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?
__Penny No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…
__Sheldon Again, time machine.
__Penny Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.
__Sheldon It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.
__Penny Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. (Storms out. A beat, and then…)
__Raj My turn!
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon So it's my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
__Leonard Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
__Sheldon You can't. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.
__Leonard Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
__Sheldon Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.
__Leonard What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
__Sheldon It won't change the past.
__Leonard But it would make the present so much nicer.
__Sheldon Are you upset about something?
__Leonard What was your first clue?
__Sheldon Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…
__Leonard Yes I'm upset.
__Sheldon Oh! I don't usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
__Leonard Yeah, good for you.
__Sheldon Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?
__Leonard I don't know. Maybe.
__Sheldon Wow, I'm on fire tonight.
__Leonard Uh, here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.
__Sheldon I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
__Leonard Thanks for pointing it out.
__Sheldon In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.
__Leonard Those are movies.
__Sheldon Well of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd.
__Howard If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon.
__Penny Oh, hey guys.
__Leonard Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys!
__Penny What are you doing?
__Leonard Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine.
__Penny Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….
__Leonard No problem.  Hang on.
__Penny But, what about your time machine.
__Leonard Some things are more important than toys.
__Penny Oh, I'm scared.
__Penny Oh, Leonard.
__Sheldon It's still my turn.
__Leonard I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.
__Sheldon Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.
__Leonard It's not about money.
__Raj We brought food.
__Howard Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.
__Leonard Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?
__Raj Why?
__Leonard Because I don't want it any more.
__Howard Why?
__Leonard Just… personal reasons.
__Sheldon My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
__Leonard Look, do you want to buy me out or not?
__Raj I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.
__Howard Screw his balcony, I'll give you a hundred and twenty and we'll put it in my garage.
__Leonard I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
__Raj Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.
__Sheldon I'll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.
__Raj Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.
__Leonard No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it.
__Howard You can't do that, look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana.
__Raj More importantly, you've a Darth Vader voice changer?
__Leonard Not for long.
__Raj Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.
__Howard Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.
__Raj Too bad, I called dibs.
__Howard Well you can't just call dibs.
__Raj I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.
__Sheldon Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.
__Leonard It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.
__Raj Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
__Howard Will you forget dibs!
__Leonard He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
__Sheldon What's the number, I'll match it.
__Raj I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees.
__Sheldon What's the exchange rate.
__Raj None of your business. Take it or leave it.
__Howard Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel.
__Leonard Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.
__Sheldon Who cares, as long as you pick me.
__Raj Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let's talk.
__Leonard Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.
__Sheldon No. I can't let you do this.
__Leonard Sheldon, get out of my way.
__Sheldon Sheldon (brandishing toy sword from Leonard's box): None shall pass.
__Leonard The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.
__Howard Okay man, be cool, we're all friends here.
__Penny What the hell's going on?
__Sheldon You hypocrite!
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Little Miss “grown ups don't play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!
__Penny Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.
__Leonard No, I needed to hear it.
__Penny No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.
__Howard I guess that makes me large breasts.
__Leonard Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life.
__Penny Really?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Oh. Wow. Good for you.
__Leonard Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later…
__Good looking man coming up stairs Excuse me. Hey, Penny!
__Penny Hi Mike.
__Mike Are you ready to go.
__Penny Yeah, I just have to change.
__Mike I'll give you a hand.
__Penny Oh, stop it! Bye guys.
__Leonard My turn on the time machine.
__Leonard Sheldon, are you okay?
__Sheldon We have to get rid of the time machine.
__Leonard It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?
__Sheldon Yeah, that's the problem, it's too big.
__Leonard I'm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas.
__Sheldon Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh.  Leonard!!!!!!!!
__Raj Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man.
__Leonard Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.
__Raj We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?
__Leonard I don't know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board.  What's going on?
__Howard Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.
__Leonard Sheldon's office? Is she lost?
__Howard Don't think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.
__Leonard Maybe she's his lawyer.
__Howard Well she's free to examine my briefs.
__Leonard Howard…
__Howard I know, I'm disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again.
__Girl Well, that should do it.
__Sheldon Thank you for coming by.  Hello.
__Leonard Oh, hey buddy.
__Sheldon Buddy.
__Howard Sorry I'm late, I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.
__Sheldon How can you be late, I wasn't expecting you at all.
__Howard Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… BAM! (shakes girl's hand) Howard Wolowitz.
__Leonard Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?
__Sheldon Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you've already met Howard.
__Missy It's nice to meet you.
__Leonard You too, swell, also.
__Howard Yeah.
__Leonard So, how do you two know each other.
__Missy Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.
__Leonard Excuse me?
__Missy It's because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly.
__Sheldon How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?
__Howard Well, I think you're delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole.
__Missy Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and… I'm sorry what was your name again.
__Sheldon Rajesh.
__ Credits sequence
__Missy My friend's getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.
__Howard Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.
__Sheldon The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she.
__Missy I guess that's why they call you a genius.
__Sheldon They call me a genius because I'm a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I'm having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.
__Leonard and Howard together Woah, woah.
__Leonard If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?
__Missy Oh, I don't think so. Shelly doesn't like company. Even as a little boy he'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.
__Sheldon They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.
__Leonard Look, you're here, we have plenty of room.
__Sheldon No we don't.
__Howard Come on, Shelly, she's family.
__Sheldon So what? I don't issue invitations to your mother.
__Missy Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.
__Sheldon And don't ever call me Shelly.
__Leonard So it's settled. You'll stay with us.
__Howard I'll walk you to your car. You're in structure 3 level C, right?
__Sheldon What just happened?
__Leonard Hee-hee, just classic.
__Sheldon I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
__Missy He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
__Missy Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there's a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.
__Howard Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?
__Missy Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.
__Sheldon Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.
__Penny Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.
__Penny Really, they have your little name label in them.
__Leonard Yeah, no, I do, I use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.
__Missy Hi.
__Penny Wow, you don't look that much alike.
__Howard Can I get a hallelujah.
__Sheldon Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.
__Howard Hallelujah.
__Raj Hey, guess what. I've been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.
__Penny Hey, good for you, Raj.
__Raj Yes, I'm very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects.
__Missy Well, there's Dr Patel at our church.
__Raj Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.
__Howard Do you like motorcycles, ‘cos I ride a hog.
__Raj A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.
__Howard You still have to wear a helmet.
__Raj Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
__Missy The sex book?
__Raj The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon's sister's pretty cute, I w….
__Leonard I wasn't staring!
__Penny I didn't say you were, I just said she was cute.
__Sheldon I'm not ignoring my sister. I'm ignoring all of you.
__Leonard I brought snacks.
__Missy Oh my! Gherkins and….
__Leonard Onion dip, it's onion dip.
__Missy Oh.
__Leonard We don't entertain much.
__Raj Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?
__Missy I guess.
__Raj We Indians invented them. You're welcome.
__Howard Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You're welcome!
__Penny Missy, I'm going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?
__Missy God yes. Thanks.
__Penny You're welcome.
__Missy Bye guys.
__Howard Bye Missy.
__Leonard Bye Missy, see you.
__Penny Goodbye Leonard!
__Leonard Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.
__Howard Okay, you two have to back off.
__Raj Why should I back off, you back off dude.
__Leonard Excuse me, this is my apartment and she's my roommate's sister.
__Howard So what, you've already got Penny.
__Leonard How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
__Howard So I can have Penny?
__Leonard Hell, no!
__Sheldon Excuse me, can I interject something. I'm ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?
__Leonard Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
__Sheldon I guess. Don't worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon That's okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.
__Howard I'm a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!
__Raj Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin.
__Sheldon Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It's noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.
__Leonard That's fascinating, but I…
__Leonard Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they're hitting on your sister.
__Leonard That's great, but I….
__Sheldon What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
__Leonard Whatever. You have to do something about it.
__Sheldon Why?
__Sheldon I don't understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways.
__Leonard Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.
__Sheldon I hadn't considered that. We do share DNA.
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Sheldon So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.
__Leonard Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.
__Sheldon You're right. If someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me.
__Howard I'm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.
__Sheldon Alright, that's enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I'm going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.
__Howard Who are you to decide that?
__Leonard He's the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.
__Sheldon You're out too, by the way.
__Leonard Say what?
__Sheldon It's nothing personal, I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.
__Howard What are you so happy about?
__Raj I'm not happy, it's the medication, I can't stop smiling.
__Sheldon Now that Leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.
__Howard Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?
__Leonard We all make mistakes, let's move on.
__Raj Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.
__Sheldon How so?
__Raj Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
__Sheldon In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.
__Raj I think you're focussing entirely too much on the drugs.
__Howard Is it ‘cause I'm Jewish, ‘cause I'd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.
__Sheldon This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.
__Leonard Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
__Sheldon Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
__Missy Oh really?
__Sheldon Oops.
__Missy Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?
__Sheldon Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.
__Leonard We all make mistakes, let's move on.
__Sheldon Truthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.
__Missy What on earth are you talking about?
__Sheldon Let me explain. You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.
__Missy And what do you mean, mediocre stock?
__Sheldon That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.
__Missy Sheldon 2.0?
__Sheldon Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.
__Missy You have got to be kidding me!
__Sheldon Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
__Missy Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God's special little people.
__Sheldon I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.
__Missy I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember?
__Sheldon I have an alternate proposal.
__Missy Go on.
__Sheldon You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.
__Leonard I agree. Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time.
__Raj She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.
__Howard Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.
__Raj Don't start with me dude.
__Leonard Sit down.
__Howard Okay.
__Leonard If we're going to fight over Missy, let's do it the right way. The honourable way.
__ And he's down!
__Howard Come on, come on, get up.
__Leonard Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.
__Sheldon I weep for humanity.
__Leonard Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. (Leaves and knocks on Penny's door.)
__Penny Ah, hey Leonard.
__Leonard Hi Penny, how's it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?
__Penny Uh, pretty much, why?
__Leonard Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?
__Penny Of course.
__Missy Hi, Leonard, what's up?
__Leonard Well, since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me?
__Missy That's so sweet. But no thanks.
__Leonard Oh. You have other plans, or…?
__Missy No.
__Leonard Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.
__Missy Thanks. See you.
__Leonard Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.
__ What do you want, Howard?
__Howard I'm fine, thanks for asking. I've come to call on Missy.
__Penny Missy?
__Missy Hi Howard.
__Howard The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?
__Missy Not really. No.
__Howard Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane.  Da-dah! (Emerges with the handkerchief, on which are written the words “will you go out with me?”)
__Missy No.
__Howard Okay. (Does something with hands, from which another yellow handkerchief emerges. This one reads “are you sure?” Missy closes the door.)
__ Missy?
__Raj Thank you. I apprec….  apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.
__Penny Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?
__Missy Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you'd show up.
__Sheldon Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.
__Missy Yeah, I'll just tell her you said hey.
__Sheldon Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles.
__Sheldon Really?
__Missy Yup, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.
__Sheldon You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?
__Missy Well yeah.
__Missy What's the difference?
__Sheldon What's the difference?
__Missy Goodbye Shelly.
__Sheldon My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.
__Leonard Oh, it's called trestling.
__Howard It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.
__Penny Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  Right come on guys, come on.  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you…
__Sheldon We might as well stop, it's a stalemate. You're beating me in tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.
__Raj Keebler Elf? I've got your Keebler Elf right here. (Strains to push Sheldon's arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.) Okay, it's a stalemate.
__Penny So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?
__Sheldon He can't eat cheesecake, he's lactose intolerant.
__Penny Okay, he can have carrot cake.
__Sheldon What about the cream cheese frosting.
__Penny he can scrape it off.
__Leonard Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?
__Penny I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody's until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.
__Sheldon For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.
__Penny Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?
__Leonard Oh, I don't think so.
__Penny Why not?
__Leonard I don't celebrate my birthday.
__Leonard No, it's no big deal, it's just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.
__Penny Uh, that's so silly.
__Sheldon It's actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.
__Penny What was it called, “I hate my son and that's why he can't have cake?”
__Sheldon It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Howard Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom's special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.
__Penny Yeah, see, that's what kids should have.
__Howard Actually that was last year.
__Penny So you've really never had a birthday party?
__Leonard No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.
__Penny And?
__Leonard Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.
__Penny Oh my God, that's terrible.
__Leonard Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7
__Howard You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”
__ Hello Penny. Leonard just left.
__Penny I know. I want to talk to you.
__Sheldon What would we talk about? We've no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of, and you know I don't care for chit-chat.
__Penny Okay, can you just let me in.
__Sheldon Well alright, but I don't see this as a promising endeavour.
__Penny Okay, here's the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.
__Sheldon I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.
__Howard Did someone say party?
__Penny He just doesn't know he wants one because he's never had one.
__Howard I suppose that's possible, but for the record, I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.
__Penny Howard, here's the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.
__Howard Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it. I'm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?
__Sheldon I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
__Penny Anguish?
__Sheldon Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.
__Penny Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.
__Sheldon Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.
__Penny Nevertheless we are….
__Sheldon In addition I really don't think that Leonard wants a…
__Penny Okay, here's the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.
__Sheldon You can't do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it's no longer mint.
__Penny Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?
__Sheldon Well of course I… oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let's throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.
__Howard What difference does it make?
__Sheldon The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators.
__Penny Is that Raj and Howard?
__Sheldon Possibly, but unverified.
__Howard Can you just let us in.
__Sheldon Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.
__Penny So, what did you get the birthday boy?
__Howard Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.
__Penny Nice. I got him a sweater.
__Howard Okay, well, he might like that, I've seen him… chilly.
__Penny Uh, Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
__Sheldon That's because I didn't bring one.
__Penny Well why not?
__Sheldon The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
__Howard Too late.
__Sheldon Let's say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it's a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?
__Howard Told you not to ask.
__Penny Well, Sheldon, you're his friend. Friends give each other presents.
__Sheldon I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.
__Howard Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.
__Penny What?
__Howard Just do it.
__Penny It's a non-optional social convention.
__Sheldon Oh. Fair enough.
__Howard He came with a manual.
__Sheldon Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don't drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.
__Penny Okay, let's do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours.
__Howard No problem.
__Penny And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.
__Howard What if guests show up?
__Penny Entertain them.
__Howard What if they're women?
__Penny Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.
__Leonard Hey.
__Howard How's it going?
__Leonard Fine.
__Howard So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.
__Leonard Seen it.
__Howard No, you've seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film.
__Leonard Oh. Pass.
__Howard Come on, afterwards there's a Q & A with Harrison Ford's body double.
__Leonard Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there's this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.
__Howard Can't you play him some other time?
__Leonard Not if you believe his doctors.
__Howard Oh my God, do you smell gas.
__Leonard No.
__Howard Yeah, no.
__Sheldon Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.
__Penny Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn't buy for themselves.
__Sheldon You mean, like a sweater?
__Penny Well, it's a fun sweater, it's got a bold geometric print.
__Sheldon Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
__Sheldon Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.
__Penny Exactly.
__Sheldon Something he wouldn't buy for himself. Something fun. Something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router.
__Howard Oh-oh.  Oh-oh!
__Leonard What's the matter?
__Howard This granola bar, there's peanuts in it.
__Leonard Oh my God, why did you eat it?
__Howard I don't know, it was just there.
__Leonard Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?
__Howard Don't yell at me, I've got to go to the emergency room.
__Leonard Now?
__Howard No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket.
__Leonard Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.
__Howard Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh….  The laundry is out of the hamper.  Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it's out of the washer. I'll call you when it's in the dryer.
__Leonard Alright, let's go.
__Penny Um, that one.
__Sheldon Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
__Penny Sure.
__Sheldon He doesn't need them, he's already got a 640 connect switch
__Penny Oh, okay then this one.
__Sheldon Why?
__Sheldon Penny! If I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.
__Penny Oh, I know I'm going to regret this but, what trauma?
__Sheldon On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.
__Penny Of course.
__Sheldon Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me… wow, this is hard. They got me… a motorised dirt bike.
__Sheldon What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?
__Penny All of them.
__Sheldon Really?
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Huh?
__Penny Okay, so we're getting this one?
__Sheldon Yeah, I suppose.
__Penny Okay, let's go.
__Random woman Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?
__Sheldon I know everything about this stuff.
__Woman Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.
__Penny Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we're getting, see, happy guy available.
__Sheldon No, no, no, no, she doesn't want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.
__Woman Thank you.
__Random guy Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?
__Sheldon It depends on what Bus you have.
__Guy I drive a Chevy Cavalier.
__Sheldon Oh, dear lord.
__Penny Sheldon, we have to go.
__Sheldon Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me.  You hold on, I'll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don't say a white one?
__Nurse Fill this out, have a seat.
__Nurse Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat.
__Howard No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I'm allergic to peanuts.
__Nurse Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat.
__Howard Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.
__Howard Yes.
__Nurse Get out of my ER.
__Howard No, you don't understand.
__Nurse Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.
__Howard Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you  to the man who freed your people.
__ Nurse, unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers you are wasting your time.
__ Hey, sorry I couldn't find a parking spot, how are you doing.
__Howard Bad, very bad.
__Leonard Really, ‘cos you don't look like you're swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home.
__Howard We can't go home.
__Leonard Why not?
__Howard Becauth  Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water.
__Leonard Alright, I'll be right back.
__Howard Penny, look, I've got a problem.
__Penny Yeah, well so do I, look you've got to stall Leonard a little longer.
__Howard I don't think I can.
__Penny You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise!”
__Howard Okay, you have to understand something, we're in a hospital right now.
__Penny Why, is Leonard okay.
__Howard Leonard's fine. I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way.
__Penny Okay, I don't need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.
__Howard Look, I've done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.
__Penny Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy.
__Howard Don't toy with me, woman.
__Penny I've got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I've got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who's two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.
__Howard Thy will be done.  I'm doing this for you, little buddy.
__Penny Him.
__Assistant Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.
__Sheldon Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else.
__Penny Sheldon, we have to go.
__Sheldon Why?
__Penny Well, for one thing, we're late for Leonard's birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security.
__Sheldon Good luck.  By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system.
__Penny Keep walking.
__Sheldon Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password.
__Nurse No he's not.
__Leonard Yes he is.
__Nurse Look, sir we are very busy here and I just don't…  holy crap!
__Howard Pees hep me!
__Nurse Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away.
__Howard Fank-u.
__Howard I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.
__Leonard You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.
__Howard Oh, right, it's your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it's all over now.
__Leonard There is a party, isn't there.
__Howard Maybe.
__Leonard Howard.
__Howard Are you mad?
__Leonard how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.
__Howard Yeah, that's why I did it.
__Leonard Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.
__ Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!
__ Time shift. View of a mobile phone video screen. Raj has a woman sitting on his shoulders.
__ Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don't know where you are dude, but it's really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh…  Oh look, there's a girl taking her shirt off.
__Penny That's my friend Carol. Remind me, I've got to introduce her to Howard.
__Raj Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.
__Penny I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
__Leonard Oh, it's okay.
__Penny Happy birthday anyways.
__Leonard Hey Penny, when, uh, when's your birthday?
__Sheldon Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon.
__Howard What's this?
__Sheldon That's what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
__Howard Well it's not.
__Sheldon How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.
__Howard You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
__Sheldon Why?
__Howard Once you're fluent you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.
__Leonard Hey!
__Sheldon Mai du lui tsa.
__Howard You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.
__Sheldon My apologies Leonard, I'm only as good as my teacher.
__Leonard Why are you learning Chinese?
__Sheldon I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.
__Leonard If I were you, I'd be more concerned by what they're passing off as chicken.
__Penny I need to use your window.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead.
__Penny Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod!
__Leonard What's going on?
__Penny Oh, I'll tell you what's going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog.  Drop dead, you stupid self-centred bastard!  Thank you.
__Sheldon Okay, where were we?
__Howard Not now, I have a blog to find.
__Penny I'm fine, Leonard, just go away.
__Leonard Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful….
__Penny GO AWAY!
__Leonard Okay, feel better, bye.  She doesn't want to talk.
__Sheldon Not surprising. Penny's emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk.
__Raj Hey, look, I found an iPod.
__Howard It's smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?
__Raj What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used.
__Leonard It was Penny's boyfriend's, they broke up.
__Howard Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere.
__Leonard You know what, I'm going to go back and try talking to her again.
__Leonard I'm not going to do that, Howard.
__Sheldon I'm not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
__Leonard What about “damsel in distress?”
__Sheldon Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply.
__Leonard I don't care. She's upset, I'm going over there.
__Howard Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they're warm.
__Leonard I'm her friend, I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.
__Howard What, so you're saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you'll just walk away?
__Leonard I said I'm her friend. Not her gay friend.
__Penny I don't.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Penny Wait.
__Leonard Wait, did you say wait?
__Penny Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?
__Leonard No. No.
__Penny Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers.
__Leonard Of course not.
__Penny Well, it's got to be one or the other, which is it?
__Leonard I'm sorry, what were the choices again?
__Penny I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.
__Leonard Yeah, no, sure.
__Penny You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.
__Leonard Actually it's not all that easy to find.
__Penny Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.
__Leonard Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought…. never mind.
__Leonard Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who's open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales.
__Penny Oh God!
__Leonard Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop?
__Penny Sandwich shop.
__Leonard Doesn't that violate the health code?
__Penny No, at the sub shop we were only making out.
__Leonard Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.
__Penny Really, do you think I overreacted?
__Leonard Maybe a little.
__Penny ‘Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise.
__Leonard No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.
__Penny Yes. You're right. I should just say I'm done with him.
__Leonard Yes, you should, go ahead, say it.
__Penny But I never gave the man a chance to explain.
__Leonard What is there to explain, it's all right here, it's a betrayal.
__Penny No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels.
__Leonard Aw, good for me. Where are you going?
__Penny I'm going over to Mike's. Leonard, thank you so much.
__Leonard Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend.
__Howard For God's sake, Sheldon, if you don't like the tangerine chicken, don't order the tangerine chicken.
__Sheldon I like tangerine chicken, I'm not getting tangerine chicken.
__Leonard Can we please change the subject.
__Raj Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
__Leonard Just roll the dice.
__Raj Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6…7
__Leonard She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!
__Howard Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.
__Sheldon Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.
__Leonard Just eat your tangerine chicken.
__Sheldon I'd love to, but I don't have tangerine chicken.
__Penny Thank you so much for your stupid advice.
__Raj Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up.
__Penny I'm sorry I yelled at you. It's not your fault.
__Leonard What happened?
__Penny Well, I went over to Mike's to make up with him.
__Leonard Yeah, I know, I know that part.
__Penny But he had already moved on.
__Leonard Already, that was quick.
__Penny That's what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck.
__Leonard Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.
__Penny How could he do that.
__Leonard Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod… yeah, no, how could he do that.
__Penny I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.
__Leonard Yeah, that must get old quick.
__Penny You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me.
__Leonard What about me?
__Penny What about you what?
__Leonard What about if you went out with me?
__Penny Are you asking me out?
__Leonard Um… yes… I am… asking you out.
__Penny Wow.
__Leonard I was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
__Penny No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally.
__Leonard …thing and honest but, it's no big deal…
__Penny Yes.
__Leonard Yes what?
__Penny Yes, I will go out with you.
__Leonard Really?
__Penny Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?
__Leonard Yeah. That's the spirit.
__Penny Sheldon.
__Sheldon Aieee ya! Xia si wo le.
__Penny I'm sorry. Look, do you have a second.
__Sheldon A second what? Pair of underwear?
__Penny I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It's about Leonard.
__Sheldon Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
__Penny Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.
__Sheldon Yes, I suppose he is.
__Penny All I'm saying is, you know Leonard the best.
__Sheldon Not necessarily. I'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.   And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised.
__Penny Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment.
__Sheldon We're not done?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Ach, why not? We're already through the looking glass anyway.
__Sheldon Well, he didn't actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia.
__Penny Oh, that's nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just… want to sit down?
__Sheldon Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don't spend much time here and so I've never really chosen a place to sit.
__Penny Well, choose.
__Sheldon There are a number of options and, I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.
__Penny Alright, why don't you just pick one at random, and then if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.
__Sheldon No, no, that's crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.
__Penny Okay. Um, here's the thing. So, I've known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…
__Sheldon A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy.
__Penny Alright, yeah, I don't really know who they are…
__Sheldon Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…
__Penny Yeah, I don't care, I don't care. The point is Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.
__Sheldon Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?
__Penny No. What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.
__Sheldon The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!
__Penny But on the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he's not looking for a fling, he's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don't know, like you would say light years.
__Sheldon I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time.
__Penny Thank you for the clarification.
__Sheldon Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight.
__Penny Right, thanks.
__Sheldon It's a common mistake.
__Penny Not the first one I've made today.
__Sheldon Okay. I think this will be my seat.
__Penny Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about.
__Sheldon Well, let's see. We might consider Schrodinger's Cat.
__Penny Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
__Sheldon No. That's Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…
__Penny Sheldon!
__Sheldon Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.
__Penny I'm sorry, I don't get the point.
__Sheldon Well of course you don't get it, I haven't made it yet. You'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as psychic.
__Sheldon Just like Schrodinger's Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is.
__Sheldon No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger…
__Sheldon Sheldon (to two oriental-looking people occupying the other seats): Chong sho sha pwe. (Caption translates to “Long Live Concrete”.) Xie xie.
__Leonard Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.
__Sheldon I can see that. Unless you're planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.
__Leonard No, it's about Penny.
__Sheldon A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.
__Leonard I don't think I can go out with her tonight.
__Leonard Other people would say “why not?”
__Sheldon Other people might be interested.
__Leonard I'm going to talk anyway.
__Sheldon I assumed you would.
__Leonard Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.
__Sheldon Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.
__Leonard Right.
__Sheldon You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on.
__Leonard Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it.
__Sheldon Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind.
__Leonard You're not helping.
__Sheldon Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?
__Leonard Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
__Sheldon Schrodinger's Cat.
__Leonard Wow, that's brilliant.
__Sheldon You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du.
__Leonard Hi.
__Penny come on in.
__Leonard Thank you. You look very nice.
__Penny Thank you. So do you.
__Leonard I made an eight o'clock reservation.
__Penny Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first.
__Leonard Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger's Cat?
__Penny Actually, I've heard far too much about Schrodinger's Cat.
__Leonard Good.
__Penny Alright, the cat's alive, let's go to dinner.
__Owner Blow your own nose and go away.
__Sheldon This is not a tangerine bicycle.
__Owner Crazy man. Call the police.
__Sheldon No. Don't call the library. Show me your mucus.  Oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen! Oy Vey!
__Penny Oh, that's very interesting.
__Leonard It's also not pink and has no berries.
__Penny Yeah, but it doesn't really answer my question.
__Leonard What was your question again?
__Penny Do you want some.
__Leonard Oh, right, no, I'm lactose intolerant.
__Penny Right.
__Leonard So, gas.
__Penny Got it.
__Leonard Well, good night.
__Penny What are you doing?
__Leonard There was a draft.
__Penny I didn't feel a draft.
__Leonard Why don't we just go into your….
__Penny Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.
__Penny No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it's just… it's only our first date.
__Leonard Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don't we just figure out where we're going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.
__Penny Or we could just wing it.
__Leonard That might work too.
__Penny Goodnight Leonard.
__Leonard Goodnight.
__ Cut to inside the apartment.
__ He's coming. Screen saver.
__Howard Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?
__Leonard Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?
__Sheldon They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.
__Howard You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.
__Leonard What are you talking about, the date went fine.
__Raj Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.
__Leonard Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It's like saying “I'm really enjoying this meal, I'm going to slow down and savour it.”
__Howard No, it's like “this fish tastes bad, so I'm going to slow down and spit it out.”
__Raj You being the fish.
__Leonard I'm not the fish.
__Howard Oh really, did you make a second date.
__Leonard Well, we sort of decided to wing it.
__Sheldon Oh, even I know that's lame.
__Leonard Okay, alright, let's assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.
__ Howard Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I'm getting into.
__Leonard I didn't say anything like that.
__Howard Good, ‘cos they don't work.
__Raj They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that's my home run swing.
__Leonard Look, everything went fine. I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.
__Howard Let's go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.
__Raj Nice close up, by the way.
__Sheldon Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.
__Leonard That's not a bad sign.
__Sheldon Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.
__Raj And the worst sign of all is, you're here and not there.
__Leonard I'm not there because I'm taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.
__Raj He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
__Howard Give him time.
__ Credits sequence
__Sheldon Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
__Penny Thanks.
__Sheldon Oh, good Lord. Why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?
__Penny Sheldon, may I ask you a question?
__Sheldon I would prefer that you not, but I won't go so far as to forbid it.
__Penny Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here's my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.
__Sheldon Well I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity? Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
__Penny No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a braniac?
__Sheldon Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.
__Penny How is that not a braniac?
__Sheldon Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.
__Penny So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he'll eventually get bored with me.
__Sheldon That depends.
__Penny On what?
__Sheldon Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Do you speak Klingon?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Do you know any card tricks?
__Penny Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.
__Sheldon Why would you lie about that?
__Penny Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn't want him to think I was some stupid loser.
__Sheldon You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
__Penny You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.
__Sheldon Yeah, but you were neither.
__Penny Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.
__Sheldon You're asking me to keep a secret?
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Well I'm sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  It's a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.
__Penny Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
__Sheldon Physiologically impossible.
__Penny Oh Sheldon, please, look, I'm asking you as a friend.
__Sheldon So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
__Penny Well, yeah.
__Sheldon Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?
__Leonard You could be Batman?
__Sheldon Sure.  I'm Batman. See.
__Penny Hi guys.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Hi Penny.
__Leonard Hey, Penny, if you're not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.
__Penny Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.
__Leonard What about Saturday?
__Penny You know, I'm not sure, the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.
__Leonard Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?
__Leonard What does that mean?
__Sheldon Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
__Leonard No I didn't.
__Sheldon I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.
__Leonard What's going on with you?
__Sheldon Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.
__Leonard What's wrong with your face?
__Sheldon There's no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.
__Leonard What?
__Leonard Good day?
__Sheldon You must release me from my oath.
__Penny Sheldon, I'm working.
__Sheldon Why don't you take a minute to decide  I can't keep your secret Penny. I'm going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
__Penny Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?
__Sheldon I'm constitutionally incapable. That's why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.
__Penny Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?
__Sheldon Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
__Penny Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you're just going to have to figure out a way to do it.
__Leonard What do you mean, you're moving out? Why?
__Sheldon There doesn't have to be a reason.
__Leonard Yeah, there kind of does.
__Leonard I'm still confused.
__Sheldon Leonard, I don't see how I could have made it any simpler.
__Howard Hey, qu'est q'wass up?
__Raj We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
__Howard And some of those skinless chicks were hot.
__Sheldon If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.
__Howard That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.
__Leonard It's not you, Howard, he says he's moving out.
__Raj What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
__Leonard No.
__Raj Did you take a band aid off in front of him?
__Leonard No.
__Howard Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?
__Raj Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?
__Leonard No.
__Howard Did you make fun of trains?
__Leonard I didn't do anything, he's just gone insane.
__Raj Well, we all knew this day was coming.
__Leonard That was fast.
__Sheldon It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.
__Sheldon Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.
__Howard Bye
__Raj Well you can't stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.
__Sheldon Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?
__Raj I hate trains.
__Sheldon Don't be ridiculous, you love trains.
__Raj Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard.
__Leonard This could work.
__Raj Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
__Sheldon Uh-oh.
__Raj What?
__Sheldon Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
__Raj Not until now.
__Sheldon I can't believe I didn't bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it.
__Raj Well, if you're not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…
__Sheldon I'm kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.
__Raj Terrific.
__Sheldon Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
__Raj Yes, isn't she an amazing actress.
__Sheldon Actually, I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.
__Raj How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
__Sheldon Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Obviously you're not that familiar with Indian cinema.
__Raj Tag. You're it.
__Howard Shouldn't you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?
__Howard Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench?
__Sheldon I don't see any way to get a park bench in here.
__Howard Do you want to switch?
__Sheldon No, that's fine. I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.
__Howard Get out of bed, we're switching.
__Sheldon Now, only if you want to.
__Howard Just get in the bed!
__Howard's mother Howard' What's going on? Are you boys roughhousing?
__Howard We're just talking ma.
__Howard's mother Howard' If you don't settle down right now, I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers.
__Howard For God's sake, ma, I'm 27 years old. It's not even a school night!  Comfy now?
__Sheldon Meh. That poster of Halle Berry's a little unnerving.
__Howard So don't look at it.
__Sheldon She's like my fourth favourite catwoman.
__Howard No kidding?
__Sheldon Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.
__Howard What about Lee Meriwether?
__Sheldon Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.
__Howard Well I'm glad that's settled.
__Sheldon That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…
__Howard Please, I'm begging you, go to sleep.
__Sheldon I'm trying, I'm counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.
__Howard Oh for God's sake.
__Sheldon But she's not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel….
__Sheldon Hey, there he is, there's my old buddy-bud-bud.
__Howard Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's valium in it. But he still wouldn't shut up, so, tag, you're it.
__Sheldon I'm ba-ack!
__Leonard I still don't know why you left.
__Sheldon I can't tell you.
__Leonard Why not.
__Sheldon I promised Penny.
__Leonard You promised Penny what?
__Sheldon That I wouldn't tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
__Leonard What secret. Tell me the secret.
__Sheldon Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can't tell Dad.
__Leonard Not that secret, the other secret.
__Sheldon I'm Batman. Shhhhh!
__Leonard Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.
__Sheldon Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't tell Leonard.
__Leonard I promise.
__Sheldon Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard.
__Leonard So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?
__Sheldon I drank milk that tasted funny.
__Leonard Penny thinks I'm too smart for her, that's ridiculous.
__Sheldon I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don't worry, that's not a secret. Everybody knows.
__Leonard Yeah, hi, listen, I know what's been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.
__Penny What are you talking about.
__Leonard First I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn't drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.
__Leonard Yes, but it's okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there's a simple solution.
__Penny Pasadena city college?
__Leonard A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here's playing hacky sack, and this girl's going to be a paralegal.
__Leonard Well, it's really not that fancy, it's just a city college.
__Penny Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?
__Leonard That doesn't matter to me at all.
__Penny So, it's fine with you if I'm not smart.
__Leonard Absolutely.  Okay, this time I know where I went wrong.  Oh bite me!
__Leonard Please let it go, Sheldon.
__Sheldon It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.
__Leonard You're nitpicking.
__Sheldon Oh-ho! Really? Well here's another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
__Howard Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy. They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
__Sheldon Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
__Howard I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.
__Penny Hi guys. Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair. I'm hoping.
__Sheldon Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
__Penny Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.
__Howard Hello.
__Leonard Hi.
__Eric Hey.
__Leonard So, yeah, good to see you.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, it's good to see you too. We should really go.
__Eric Yeah.
__Penny Bye guys.
__Eric Like your hat.
__Howard Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.
__Leonard It wasn't awkward. It wasn't fun. Besides, what's the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.
__Raj By moving on, do you mean, she's going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?
__Sheldon That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can't just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.
__Leonard Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.
__Sheldon You're wearing modern underwear?
__Leonard Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?
__Sheldon I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
__Leonard You went out and bought linen?
__Sheldon Don't be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.
__Leonard Borrowed?
__ Credits sequence
__Howard Are you saying that you've been holding back?
__Leonard Of course. Out of respect.
__Howard So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?
__Raj Who were you respecting then?
__Leonard What? I've dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.
__Sheldon Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.
__Leonard Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?
__Raj Doesn't count.
__Leonard Why not?
__Raj What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.
__Howard You're only saying that because of what happened to you.
__Leonard What happened to you?
__Raj N-n-n-nothing happened to me.
__Howard It wasn't your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.
__Leonard Yes I have, it's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
__Howard Like who?
__Leonard Well, there's Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it's a little geographically undesireable.
__Raj What about Leslie Winkle.
__Sheldon Oh no.
__Raj Why?
__Sheldon Her research methodology is sloppy, she's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she's often mean to me.
__Raj I think she's smoking hot.
__Howard I'd hit that.
__Sheldon You'd hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
__Leonard Look, I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
__Howard Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.
__Raj Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
__Howard You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?
__Raj I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it.  And he told me his name was Kimberley!
__Leonard How?
__Sheldon If we were, the food would be better.
__Leslie Hey, Leonard.
__Leonard Hey, Leslie.
__Leslie Hey, dummy.
__Sheldon Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.
__Leslie Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something.
__Leonard Uh, sure.
__Sheldon Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.
__Leslie Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.
__Leonard Where did you hear that?
__Leslie Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me.
__Leonard Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
__Leslie I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you're unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.
__Leonard Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
__Leslie No, I'm all done with casual sex. From now on I'm fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.
__Leonard Really, what changed?
__Leslie It's hard to say, I guess there's just a time in every woman's life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn't know.
__Leonard Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?
__Leslie Anyway, I just figure it's time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?
__Leonard Oh, I'm flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?
__Leslie Your place, we'll order Chinese, you'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.
__Leonard Sounds fun.
__Leslie I'll leave the details up to you, I think it's better if you assume the male role.
__Leslie Great. Call me.
__Leonard Terrific.
__Sheldon You know what this means, don't you? Break out the Red Bull, it's time to rock Mario old school.
__Leonard I kind of have other plans tonight.
__Sheldon But it's Friday. Friday's always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.
__Leonard Well, the thing is, someone's coming over.
__Sheldon Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.
__Leonard Sheldon, it's a date, I have a date coming over.
__Sheldon Oh, well you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
__Leonard Why, what's so unusual about me having a date?
__Sheldon Well, statistically speaking…
__Leonard Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.
__Sheldon Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
__Sheldon Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.
__Leonard I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.
__Sheldon Well alright then.
__Sheldon Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
__Penny Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?
__Sheldon I'm a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.
__Penny Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don't you just go to a movie or something?
__Sheldon Alone?
__Penny Yeah, why not?
__Sheldon What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.
__Sheldon No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
__Penny Well why don't you go to a coffee shop.
__Sheldon I don't drink coffee.
__Penny They have other things.
__Sheldon What do they have?
__Penny I don't know, you know, cookies, pastries…
__Sheldon Pastries such as bearclaws?
__Penny Yeah, sure.
__Sheldon I don't like bearclaws.
__Leslie Heya Penny. Dumbass.
__Sheldon Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
__Penny Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they're both scientists.
__Sheldon Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
__Sheldon Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I'm just enabling you.
__Leonard Yeah, it's from Changs.
__Leslie Not Chows?
__Leonard No, Changs.
__Leslie What happened to Chows?
__Leonard It changed.
__Leslie Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have?  I'm sorry, that was a little abrupt.
__Leonard A little.
__Leslie I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.
__Leonard I sure hope so.
__Leslie Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?
__Sheldon I'm sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.
__Leslie Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there's the lactose intolerance.
__Sheldon Don't forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs.
__Leonard Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.  What now?
__Sheldon I have to make pee-pee.
__ Time shift to later.
__ Listen, I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.
__Leslie If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.
__Leonard Well, I think tonight was a very good start.
__Leonard No problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.
__Leslie Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
__Leonard Sure.
__Leslie Again, it's your decision, you're the man.
__Penny No, it wasn't my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.
__Eric From the Charlie Brown cartoons?
__Penny No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.
__Leonard Hello.
__Penny Leslie.
__Leslie Hi.
__ Okay, well, goodnight.
__Penny Okay, well, goodnight.
__Leslie That ain't going to make your point. (Grabs him and tries to out-passion Penny. The two couples get more passionate trying to outdo each other until Leonard grabs Leslie's ass.) Okay, that's enough.  Call me
__Leonard Right
__Penny Okay, goodnight.
__Eric What?
__Penny Had a great time, ciao
__Howard Come on, Sheldon, there's so few places I can wear my jester costume.
__Sheldon I don't care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
__Raj Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
__Sheldon You mean like Spock?
__Raj Sure.
__Leslie Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.
__Leonard Hey, why don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us.
__Howard Hmm, let's do it.
__Sheldon If you're having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.
__Leonard Don't make this hard for me.
__Sheldon It's not hard. It's simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.
__Leonard You're right, it is simple.
__Sheldon Penny.
__Penny Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know, I still don't understand why you just don't go to dinner or something.
__Sheldon Alright, let's say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone's not touching my food?
__Penny Goodnight Sheldon.
__Sheldon Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?
__Penny Excuse me?
__Sheldon I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
__Penny Okay, where is this coming from?
__Sheldon Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
__Penny Your arch enemy?
__Sheldon Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.
__Penny Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
__Sheldon Do you know, it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.
__Penny Sheldon, come back, you're losing me.
__Sheldon Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
__Sheldon She called me dumbass.
__Penny I know. I heard.
__Sheldon Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.
__Penny Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.
__Sheldon No, that response is unacceptable to me.
__Penny Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…
__Sheldon Smart? I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
__Penny Are you going to let me talk?
__Sheldon I'm sorry.
__Penny You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.
__Sheldon You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
__Penny Okay, let me put it this way, if you're really Leonard's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
__Sheldon Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
__Penny Because love trumps hate.
__Sheldon Oh now you're just making stuff up.
__Penny Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
__Leonard If the word is pee-pee, just do it.
__Sheldon Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.
__Leslie Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.
__Sheldon I'm listening, amuse me.
__Leslie Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.
__Sheldon Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
__Leslie Are you going to let him talk to me like that?
__Leonard Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
__Leslie No there isn't, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes.
__Leonard Sheldon, don't make that noise, it's disrespectful.
__Sheldon I hope so, it was a snort of derision.
__Leslie You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.
__Leonard Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.
__Leslie Well, I'm glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.
__Leonard Truth, what truth? We're talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it's no big deal.
__Leslie Oh, it isn't, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?
__Leonard I guess we let them wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.
__Leslie We can't let them choose, Leonard, they're children.
__Leonard Wait, where are you going?
__Leslie I'm sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker.
__Sheldon Look on the bright side.
__Leonard What's the bright side?
__Sheldon Only nine more months to comic-con.
__Leonard Yeah, that's great, you guys want corn dogs?
__Howard Yeah.
__Sheldon That's a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn't come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
__Penny Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.
__Sheldon You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?
__Penny Yeah!
__Sheldon Alright then.
__Penny Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.
__Sheldon Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
__Penny I can't get the damned key out.
__Sheldon Well that's not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.
__Penny Thankyou, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You're welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?
__Sheldon Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure….
__Penny I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven't got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven't gotten a raise at work, haven't even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.
__Sheldon Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they're almost pure protein.
__Penny I did, and he said he'll get here when he gets here.
__Sheldon And you're frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
__Penny No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly.
__Sheldon There there.  Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
__Penny No Sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.
__Sheldon Alright then.
__Penny For God's sake!
__Sheldon Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Sheldor?
__Sheldon The Conqueror.
__Penny What are you doing?
__Sheldon AFK. I'm playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian.
__Penny Oh.
__Sheldon Sheldor, back online.
__Penny What's AFK?
__Sheldon AFK. Away from keyboard.
__Penny OIC.
__Sheldon What does that stand for?
__Penny Oh, I see?
__Sheldon Yes, but what does it stand for?
__Penny Oh, I don't know. Can I see them in another colour?
__Sheldon Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Penny Leonard, guess what, I'm a level three warrior.
__Leonard Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?
__Penny Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!
__Leonard I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it's starting to attract wildlife.
__Penny Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?
__Sheldon It doesn't matter, right now you're looking for treasure.
__Penny Okay.  Wait, wait, where are you going?
__Sheldon You're okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.
__Leonard Want to catch me up?
__Sheldon Well let's see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn't had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.
__Leonard Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?
__Penny Oh my God, a treasure chest, I'm rich!
__Howard Let her rip.
__ (Leonard turns on stereo with a remote. Rhythmic bass-heavy music plays. The liquid begins dancing on the speaker.)
__Leonard Hey, check it out, it's just corn starch and water.
__Howard That's what makes it get all funky.
__Penny Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.
__Howard No, that's what she said, Sheldon.
__Penny Okay, look, I bought the game, and I've been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.
__Sheldon Do you have the enchanted sword?
__Penny No, no, I've a bronze dagger.
__Sheldon You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it's like the car key in your apartment door all over again.
__Penny Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?
__Sheldon Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?
__Penny Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
__Sheldon No, no, no, it's… oh for God's sakes, gimme.
__Penny Thank you, I really appreciate this.
__Sheldon You're going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.
__Penny Don't patronise me, just get the sword.
__Howard What the frak?
__Leonard Beats me. They were playing all last night too.
__Raj It's like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
__Howard Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.
__Leonard No, that's Marcie. Peppermint Patty's just athletic.
__Sheldon There you go, one enchanted sword.
__Penny Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain.
__Sheldon That girl needs to get a life.
__Sheldon Danger, danger.
__Penny No danger, look, it's just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?
__Sheldon You're in my bedroom.
__Penny Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.
__Sheldon People can't be in my bedroom.
__Penny Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?
__Sheldon I'm not wearing pyjama bottoms.
__Penny Why not?
__Sheldon I spilled grape juice.
__Penny Well, wear different pyjamas.
__Sheldon I can't wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.
__Penny Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?
__Sheldon You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?
__Penny Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.
__Sheldon Of course it's not, you're only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.
__Penny Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.
__ Cut to Leonard, exiting his bedroom.
__ Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.
__Penny Okay, well you were great, thanks.  Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don't got in Sheldon's room, he's not wearing bottoms.
__Leonard Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?
__Sheldon I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes.
__Gablehauser Fine. Dr Winkle, what colourful name did you call Dr Cooper this time?
__Leslie Dr Dumbass.
__Gablehauser Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises.
__Sheldon No she doesn't.
__Leslie No I don't.
__Sheldon Here's the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.
__Leslie It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.
__Sheldon If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty.  Oh, Penny!
__Gablehauser You need to get that Dr Cooper?
__Sheldon God, no.
__Leslie Well don't turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you've been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year.
__Sheldon Oh yeah, well, you wouldn't even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…
__Gablehauser Excuse me. Gablehauser.  It's for you.
__Leslie Dumbass.
__Sheldon Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.
__Leonard Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone.
__Sheldon I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don't know what else to do.
__Leonard Well, what am I supposed to do?
__Sheldon I don't know, but if you don't figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.
__Leonard You mean, up until now we've been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard I'll go talk to her.
__Leonard Hey Penny.
__Penny Busy.
__Leonard Yeah, I see that. Shouldn't you be at work?
__Penny I don't work on Mondays.
__Leonard It's Thursday. Listen, Penny.
__Penny Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?
__Leonard Okay, um, here's the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.
__Penny Yeah, get to the point, I'm about to level up here.
__Leonard Well, i-i-i-it's just if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.
__Penny Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope's back online.
__Leonard Penny, you've got cheetos in your hair.
__Penny Oh, thanks.
__Leonard Wow.
__Penny- warrior Penny- Leonard, I said not now.
__Leonard-warrior Leonard- Yeah, I know, I'm just a little concerned about you.
__Penny-warrior Penny- I said not now.
__Leonard-warrior's head Leonard-warrior' Okay, maybe later.
__Leonard and Howard Hey.
__Raj Hey, what's with him?
__Howard Me too. But probably in a different way.
__Leonard She's gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she's playing non-stop.
__Raj Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There's nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.
__Leonard Sheldon, wake up.
__Sheldon Danger, danger.
__Leslie Afternoon men. Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, I'm too tired to do this.
__Leslie Right, I heard you've been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie.
__Sheldon She comes into my room. No-one's supposed to be in my room.
__Leslie Well, I would postulate that she's escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.
__Howard I do that too. But probably in a different way.
__Leonard That's not what she's doing, Leslie, she's just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.
__Leslie Everything has to do with sex.
__Howard Mmmm, testify.
__Leslie I'm not touching that.
__Leonard Leslie, you are way off base here.
__Sheldon Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.
__Leslie Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.
__Sheldon Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.
__Howard I'll take the bullet.
__Leonard Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.
__Sheldon Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I'm going to take action.  Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?
__Man No.
__Man Uh, sure, why not?
__Leonard Sheldon…
__Sheldon Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?
__Man Uh… (checks out Sheldon's package) Yeah, yeah. (Pulls out pen and writes it on Sheldon's hand.)
__Sheldon There, problem solved.
__Leslie Dumbass.
__Sheldon Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
__Penny Got it.
__Sheldon I must say, you're playing very well for a woman of 23?
__Penny 22.
__Sheldon Right. 22.
__Penny Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?
__Sheldon What happened to the rest of your group?
__Penny I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.
__Sheldon Frenzy stance.
__Penny Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!
__Sheldon So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?
__Penny What?
__Sheldon These are market research questions. I'm filling out the online registration for your game.
__Penny Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!
__Penny Thank you.
__Sheldon You're welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?
__Penny That's on the registration?
__Sheldon Oh yes, it's quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.
__Penny Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I'm a big old five.
__Sheldon Good to know. Big old five.
__Man Hi.
__Sheldon Leonard, this is Tom.
__Leonard Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
__Sheldon Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.
__Leonard Chosen by science?
__Sheldon Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.
__Leonard You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
__Sheldon No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.
__Leonard This is bad.
__Sheldon Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he's going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.
__Leonard Really, really bad.
__Sheldon I'm surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she's a big old five.
__Penny Sheldon, what do you want.
__Sheldon Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I'd like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.
__Tom Hi Penny.
__Penny Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don't know what they're doing, we've got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.
__Sheldon Can we talk about this later.
__Penny No, no, no, no, I need you now.
__Sheldon But wouldn't you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.
__Penny Whatever, I'll figure it out myself.
__Tom Bye, Penny. I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look anything like her picture.
__Leonard They never do.
__Penny-warrior Penny- Who are you?
__Warrior It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing, followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?
__Penny-warrior Penny- Yeah, sure, why not?
__Penny Oh my God, I need help.
__Penny I'm the dumplings.
__Howard Yes, you are.
__Penny Creepy, Howard.
__Howard Creepy good or creepy bad?
__Leonard Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
__Howard That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight.  I'm not necessarily talking to the food.
__Penny Sit over there.
__Sheldon Sit over there. Baby wipe?
__Penny What do you have….
__Leonard and Howard together Don't! Don't! Don't!
__Sheldon I'll tell you why.
__Leonard and Howard O-o-o-oh!
__Sheldon I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
__Penny I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
__Leonard and Howard Why? Don't!
__Sheldon Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
__Raj Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new…  ew-ew-ew
__Penny Gosh, Raj, do you think you'll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?  Okay, well, I'll just, um, go eat by myself.
__Leonard Penny, you don't have to do that.
__Penny No, it's okay, between  him not talking,  him talking and…  him, I'm better off alone, so,  goodbye you poor strange little man
__Raj She's so considerate.
__Howard So what's your news?
__Raj Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
__Leonard Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.
__Leonard and Howard together Well, wow, that's incredible.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?
__Raj Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
__Sheldon If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
__Raj It's pretty cool, they've got me in with a guy who's doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who's using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.
__Howard Oh, I'd so do her.
__Leonard You'd do the dolphins.
__Howard Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
__Raj Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.
__Howard Poverty? Your father's a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.
__Raj It's a lease.
__Sheldon I'm confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
__Raj Peer review? It's People magazine. People picked me.
__Sheldon What people?
__Raj The people from People.
__Sheldon Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that's been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?
__Raj Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren't giving her this kind of crap.
__Leonard Are you proud of yourself?
__Sheldon In general, yes.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Hi Sheldon.
__Sheldon Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.
__Howard Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.
__Sheldon Apologise, for what?
__Sheldon I sense you're trying to tell me something.
__Sheldon Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.
__Leonard Really, do tell.
__Sheldon How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world's greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.
__Leonard Okay, let's try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?
__Sheldon I had not considered that.
__Sheldon I often forget other people have limitations. It's so sad.
__Howard He can feel sadness?
__Leonard Not really, it's what you and I would call condescension.
__Sheldon But I'm not.
__Howard Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I'm bigger than that.
__Sheldon Fine, what do you want me to do?
__Leonard Smile.
__Howard Oh crap, that's terrifying.
__Leonard We're here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.
__Howard Try less teeth. (Does. It isn't much better.)
__Leonard Close enough, come on.  Hi Raj.
__Raj Hey guys, what's up?
__Howard We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
__Leonard Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?
__Raj It's very nice of you, I would like that.
__Gablehauser Hello boys.
__Raj Dr Gablehouser.
__Gablehauser Dr Koothrappali.
__Leonard Dr Gablehauser.
__Gablehauser Dr Hoffstadter.
__Sheldon Dr Gablehauser.
__Gablehauser Dr Cooper.
__Howard Dr Gablehauser.
__Gablehauser Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I've got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?
__Raj Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.
__Gablehauser I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.
__Sheldon Well, you didn't discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.
__Leonard Sheldon!
__Sheldon Oh, sorry.
__Gablehauser Well, we've got to get you into a better office, something more suited to your status.
__Raj Really, you don't have to go to any trouble.
__Gablehauser How about if I put you in Von Gerlick's old office?
__Raj I'd rather have Fishbine's, it's bigger.
__Gablehauser Done.
__Howard Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine's office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.
__Sheldon He gets a new office, I can't even get paper towels in the men's room?
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon Damn, this is hard.
__Gablehauser Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?
__Leonard Science?
__Gablehauser Money.
__Howard Told you.
__Gablehauser And this boy's picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than… well, taller than you (ruffling Howard's hair.)
__Howard I have a master's degree.
__Gablehauser Who doesn't? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President's dining room?
__Raj I didn't even know there was a President's dining room.
__Gablehauser It's the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy.
__Raj Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys.
__Leonard You can stop smiling now.
__Sheldon Aaaah!
__Leonard No.
__Raj It's fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They're going to digitally add a supernova, they say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
__Sheldon Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.
__Raj Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.
__Howard They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
__Sheldon Have we at this point met our social obligations?
__Leonard Not yet.
__Raj Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can't go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don't know what I'd do without him.
__Leonard You just got him this afternoon.
__Raj Yes, but I'm finding that having a lackey suits me.
__Leonard A lackey?
__Sheldon Now?
__Leonard Almost.
__Raj Speaking of untouchables, I've got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.
__Howard Oh, gee, thanks.
__Raj Oh, you're welcome. Of course, I couldn't get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that's for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.
__Sheldon There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point.
__Penny Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.
__Raj Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?
__Howard Gee, I'd love to Raj, but I can't make it.
__Raj Oh, okay, Leonard?
__Leonard Well, uh, no I… the… no.
__Raj Sheldon?
__Sheldon I can make it, but I won't.
__Penny What are you guys talking about?
__Raj Well, there's a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.
__Penny And you guys aren't going? I can't believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not even going to be there to support him?
__Sheldon A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
__Howard That would be cool. I'd go to that reception.
__Penny Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn't even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.
__Raj Would you like to go with me?
__Penny Of course I would, I would be honoured.
__Raj Really? Cool.
__Penny Shame on you guys.
__Raj Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can't believe it took you a whole year.
__Sheldon Now?
__Leonard Now.
__Raj Hey, buddy. I'm going to be in people magazine.
__Charlie Sheen Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.
__Penny Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren't you?
__Raj It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you're getting ready.
__Penny Oh, I'm ready.
__Raj That's what you're wearing.
__Penny Um, yeah, why what's wrong with it?
__Raj Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.
__Penny Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you're gonna get.
__Raj Okey dokey, let's roll. Alright, it's time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.
__Penny Hey Leonard.
__Leonard Hey.
__Raj Dude.
__Leonard You look very nice.
__Raj and Penny together Thank you.
__Penny Uh, come on, good night Leonard.
__Leonard Good night.
__Raj Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Raj It's bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
__Raj It has more food too.
__Penny Alright, come on, come on.
__Raj I'm coming up so you better get this party started.
__Leonard Hey.
__Howard Hey, good news, you don't have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.
__Leonard Anythingforagreencard.com?
__Leonard You're joking.
__Howard Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they're just learning English.
__Leonard Pass.
__Howard So you're just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?
__Leonard It's not a date, and that's racist.
__Leonard Let's just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
__Sheldon Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Brown rice, not white?
__Sheldon Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Leonard You're welcome.
__Sheldon What took you so long?
__Leonard Just sit down and eat.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Leonard Alright, it's shredded, what do you want me to do?
__Sheldon I want you to check before you accept the order.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Sheldon Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
__Leonard He's not going to have intercourse with Penny.
__Sheldon Then there's no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.
__Howard Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.
__Leonard Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
__Sheldon No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.
__Howard Lucky?
__Sheldon Yes, Lucky.
__Leonard He's irony impaired, just move on.
__Howard Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.
__Sheldon While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.
__Howard So, not a puppy?
__Sheldon Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.
__Leonard A griffin?
__Sheldon Yes, half eagle, half lion.
__Leonard And mythological.
__Sheldon Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.
__Howard Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a good lion semen story, what's your point.
__Sheldon My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.
__Leonard You want to breed a new friend?
__Sheldon That's one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they're doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we're playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.
__Howard Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way, but, you're insane.
__Leonard That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.
__Leonard If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.
__Howard And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.
__Sheldon He should share our love of technology.
__Howard And he should know a lot of women.
__Leonard Yeah, let's see, money, women, technology, okay we're agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.
__Penny Yes, it's very nice, goodnight Raj.
__Raj No, wait, the evening's not over.
__Penny Yes it is.
__Raj No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.
__Penny Oh, wow, is the evening over.
__Raj Wait, wait, that's my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.
__Penny Wait, meet them.
__Raj Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I'm not drunk.
__Mrs Koothrappali Why would you say that?
__Raj Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.
__Penny I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
__Dr Koothrappali I can't see her, centre her in the frame.
__Raj Here you go, cute huh?
__Mrs Koothrappali She's not Indian.
__Dr Koothrappali So, she's not Indian, the boy's just sowing some wild oats.
__Penny No, no, there's no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.
__Mrs Koothrappali What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.
__Raj What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
__Mrs Koothrappali What's wrong with him?
__Dr Koothrappali She's feisty. I like that.
__Raj Sorry.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, it's okay.
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Sheldon Yeah, we're going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night's sleep. I don't like the way Darth Vader stares at me.
__Sheldon Oh, just because your career's been stagnant for a few years, that's no reason to give up.
__Leonard Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
__Sheldon Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Then you can drive. Let's go.
__Sheldon You did.
__Leonard And?
__Sheldon I didn't. Let's go.
__Leonard Goodnight, Sheldon.
__Sheldon But how am I going to get to work?
__Leonard Take the bus.
__Sheldon I can't take the bus any more. They don't have seatbelts. And they won't let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
__Leonard You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
__Leonard Oh, you're a big boy, you'll figure it out.
__Sheldon Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!
__Penny Sheldon, what is it?
__Sheldon Leonard's asleep.
__Penny Thanks for the update
__Sheldon No, wait. You have to drive me to work.
__Penny Yeah, uh, I really don't think I do.
__Sheldon But I don't drive, and I can't take the bus.
__Penny Yeah, honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?
__Sheldon Penny. Didn't you recently state that you and I are friends?
__Penny Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.
__Sheldon Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
__Penny Oh, dear God.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you're done, we'll go.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny You know this is my day off, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, good. I'm not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Sheldon Typically that's an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.
__Penny It's fine, it's been on for, like, a month.
__Sheldon Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.
__Penny Sheldon, it's fine.
__Sheldon If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on. That's why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it's not fine.
__Penny Uh, maybe the light's broken.
__Sheldon Is there a “check the check engine light light”?  O-o-o-oh!
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one's reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.
__Sheldon Of course not.
__Penny Too bad.
__Sheldon You're going up Euclid Avenue?
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Sheldon Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
__Penny Well, good for Leonard.
__Sheldon Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you're not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here's a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon The answer's tricky. It's Second Street. You see, you'd think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Oh, come on, it's fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I'll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I'll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that's a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you're left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M's because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?
__Penny How about we just have a little quiet time now?
__Sheldon All right. Hmm, huh, I'm sorry, I'm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.
__Penny Get out.
__Sheldon Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I'm not sure I'm capable of performing diagnostics.
__Penny I said, get out.
__Sheldon Okay. I'll give it a shot.
__Leonard I just got here.
__Sheldon Good, perfect timing.
__Leonard Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can't drive you for the next few weeks.
__Sheldon No, you said you couldn't drive me to work, this is from work.
__Leonard Howard, help me out here.
__Howard No, just for the fun of it, I'm gonna take his side.
__Sheldon Now, how do you propose I get home?
__Leonard How did you get here in the first place?
__Sheldon Penny. But I sense that's no longer an option.
__Leonard Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you're just going to have to find someone else to take you home.
__Howard Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.
__Sheldon We had a difference of opinion.
__Raj Over what?
__Sheldon Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?
__Raj I'm taking you home.
__Sheldon Oh, but I'm not going home. It's Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it's creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there's a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.
__Raj I have a better idea.
__Sheldon You want to go to pottery barn first?
__All Good morning.
__Leonard Sheldon, sit down.
__Sheldon She's in my spot. Don't look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.
__Penny Sheldon, you know  that we care about you.
__Howard And it's because we care about you that we've decided we have to speak up.
__Penny You're hurting the people around you, sweetie.
__Leonard So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.
__Sheldon Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don't have a problem.
__Howard This madness has to stop.
__Leonard Penny's taking you to the DMV, I'm going to bed.
__Sheldon Why Penny?
__Leonard Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.
__Penny All right, come on Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hold on, I have one condition.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon And Radio Shack.
__Penny Fine.
__Sheldon And the comic book store.
__Penny All right!
__Howard Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store.
__Raj I like comic books.
__Howard Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.
__Penny Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn't you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
__Sheldon I was otherwise engaged.
__Penny Doing what?
__Sheldon Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
__Penny Well, how 'bout when you were 17?
__DMV Lady Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!  Application?
__Sheldon I'm actually more of a theorist.
__Howard The application in your hand, give it to her.
__Sheldon Oh.
__DMV Lady Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!
__Sheldon Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.
__DMV Lady Look at that sign up there.
__Sheldon Yes?
__DMV Lady Does it say I give a damn?
__Sheldon No.
__DMV Lady That's because I don't.
__Sheldon Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There's no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.
__DMV Lady Look at the sign.
__Penny Sheldon, it's C, just put down C.
__Sheldon I don't need your help, Penny.
__DMV Lady Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!
__Sheldon No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.
__Howard Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?
__Sheldon How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.
__DMV Lady Here's your learner's permit. Go away.
__Sheldon But I'm not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
__DMV Lady Don't make me climb over this counter.
__Penny Come on, let's go.
__DMV Lady Next!
__Sheldon Aced it.
__Leonard Booting.
__Howard This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
__Sheldon Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?
__Howard I haven't configured it yet. Let's see… Bradley tank… transport truck…  Batmobile…
__Leonard No.
__Howard Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.
__Howard What?
__Sheldon Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.
__Howard Fine, what colour do you want?
__Sheldon You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?
__Howard Black it is.
__Leonard Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.
__Sheldon I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.
__Leonard Okay, fasten your seat belt.
__Sheldon Click. Now, are there air bags?
__Leonard You don't need air bags.
__Sheldon What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
__Penny I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.
__Leonard Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.
__ Oh.
__Leonard Oh.
__Howard Oh.
__Leonard Watch out.
__Howard Oh God!
__Leonard Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!
__ Thank you.
__Leonard How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
__Sheldon I don't know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.
__Leonard Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
__Sheldon No. I quit.
__Leonard Aw, the pet store?
__Sheldon No, I'm not giving up, I never give up.
__Leonard So what is it you're doing?
__Sheldon I'm transcending the situation. I'm clearly too evolved for driving.
__Leonard What does that mean?
__Sheldon Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?
__Leonard I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.
__Sheldon Well, those are indicators that I'm farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.
__Leonard No kidding.
__Sheldon Well, no, no, I'm not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that's for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I'm not meant to.
__Leonard Yes, you are, you're meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
__Sheldon No, no. Leonard, I'm meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it's safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.
__Leonard It's never safe.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, I know that now.
__Leonard Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
__Sheldon Homo Novus doesn't know.
__Leonard Well, hang in there, maybe you'll evolve into something with wings.
__Leonard Hey.
__Raj Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don't know about?
__Leonard No, he lives here now.
__Howard Really? Why?
__Raj But you finished your experiment a week ago.
__Leonard Yep
__Cleaning Lady 2 Cleaning Lady 2: It must be rats.
__Cleaning Lady 1 Cleaning Lady 1: Rats don't make toast and cut off the crust.
__ You saw nothing!
__Sheldon Forget it.
__Leonard Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
__Sheldon It's a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
__Leonard If you don't do this, I won't take you to the comic book store.
__Sheldon Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I'd already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o'clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it's more likely that you'll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.
__Leonard Oh, good God.
__Sheldon In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you'll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.
__Leonard Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now, huh?
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Plus there's a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That's right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.
__Raj Isn't there a university policy against dating graduate students?
__Leonard No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.
__Raj Damn, there's always a catch.
__Leslie Winkle Hey, guys.
__Leonard Hey, Leslie.
__Leslie So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.
__Sheldon The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
__Leslie Because first-rate minds call you “dumbass”?
__Sheldon Oh, yeah? Well… you're a mean person.
__Girl Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I'm Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you're just brilliant.
__Sheldon That is the prevailing opinion.
__Leslie Oh, now I'm gonna throw up.
__Howard Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station's Liquid Waste Disposal System.
__Ramona Ew. Dr. Cooper, I've read everything you've published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?
__Sheldon Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.
__Howard Woof.
__Sheldon The fact is I'm quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
__Ramona Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.
__Sheldon It's what I do.
__Howard You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.
__Ramona Again, ew. You know, I'd love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
__Sheldon I don't drink coffee.
__Howard I do. I love me a cup of joe.
__Ramona Well, it doesn't have to be coffee. How about dinner?
__Sheldon I do eat dinner.
__Ramona Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.
__Sheldon I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
__Ramona Excuse me?
__Sheldon Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.
__Ramona What if I brought food to your place?
__Sheldon That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.
__Ramona You got it. I already have your address.
__Sheldon What a nice girl.
__Howard Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?
__Ramona That's okay. Guess I'm taking the stairs.
__Penny Where you going?
__Ramona 4-A.
__Penny Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
__Ramona No, Dr. Cooper.
__Penny Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
__Ramona We're having dinner.
__Penny Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?
__Ramona He is cute, isn't he?
__Penny Sheldon Cooper?
__Leonard Hey, Ramona. Come on in.
__Ramona Thanks. Where should I put this?
__Leonard Uh, the kitchen's fine.  Hey, what are you doing?
__Penny I need to see this.
__Leonard Uh-huh. The viewing area's right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona's here.
__Sheldon Oh, hello.
__Ramona Oh, sorry I'm late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.
__Sheldon Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
__Ramona So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.
__Sheldon My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
__Ramona I'm sorry I didn't bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.
__Howard To watch, right?
__Leonard No, come on, now, we're going out.
__Penny Oh, come on, we'll be quiet.
__Leonard Let's go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is.
__Penny Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what's Sheldon's deal?
__Leonard What do you mean “deal”?
__Penny You know, like what's his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
__Penny Come on, everybody has a deal.
__Howard Not Sheldon. Over the years, we've formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I'm an advocate of mytosis.
__Penny I'm sorry?
__Howard I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.
__Leonard On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.
__Penny Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.
__Leonard Hey, do you want to hang out with us?
__Penny What are you guys gonna do?
__Leonard Uh…
__Howard My mom's making a brisket tonight.
__Leonard The one with the little onions? Mmm.
__Penny Yeah, I'm busy, so, goodnight.
__Howard Her loss. Let's go.
__Raj Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
__Leonard Don't.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
__Leonard So, how'd it go with Ramona last night?
__Sheldon Oh, great. She's smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.
__Ramona Here's your spinach mushroom omelette .
__Sheldon Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
__Ramona Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.
__Sheldon Ramona pointed out that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
__Ramona Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.
__Sheldon You don't tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.
__Leonard Touche.
__Leslie Morning.
__Leonard Ah, hey Leslie.
__Leslie So, Sheldon, I see you're organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.
__Ramona There won't be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.
__Sheldon Oh, good one.
__Leslie I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I'll let you keep your lunch money today.
__Ramona Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you're going to stay, you'll have to be respectful and quiet.
__Leonard Wait for me.
__Ramona So have you worked out the neutrino issue?
__Sheldon Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.
__Ramona You're so witty.
__Sheldon Aren't I?
__ Dr. Cooper is working.
__Sheldon Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles
__Penny Sorry.  Holy crap on a cracker.
__Leonard Hey, Penny.
__Penny Hi. You know, you probably don't want to go in there.
__Leonard Why? What are they doing?
__Penny You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist's office with dolls.
__Leonard Hoo-boy.
__Ramona Dr. Cooper's working.
__Leonard Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali's. You coming?
__Sheldon Oh, yes, it's Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.
__Ramona You're not going to Halo night.
__Sheldon Yes, I am. It's Wednesday. Wednesday's Halo night.</i>
__Ramona Didn't a great man once say, “Science demands nothing less than the fervent and
__ unconditional dedication of our entire lives”?
__ He did.
__Ramona And who was that great man?
__Sheldon Me. Sorry, Leonard.
__Leonard Seriously? You're not coming?
__Sheldon You heard her. How can I argue with me?
__Leonard Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is.
__Ramona Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.
__Sheldon I prefer to think of it as I'm pulling them forward.
__Ramona Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn't waste an evening playing video games.
__Sheldon He does on Wednesdays.
__Sheldon He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
__Ramona What do you think?
__Sheldon Drat.
__Ramona Now shall we get back to work?
__Sheldon I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.  I guess I can wait for the DVD.  And then never ever watch it.
__Montage of scenes To the sound of “You Can Be My Yoko Ono” by Barenaked Ladies  we see 1. the guys set off for paintball while Sheldon, dressed in paintball gear, sadly waves them goodbye, 2. Ramona catch Sheldon hiding behind the shower curtain playing on a Nintendo DS, 3. Ramona remove a book Sheldon is reading to reveal a Batman comic underneath, 4. Sheldon escape the apartment in his paintball gear only to be chased back inside by Ramona returning with groceries, she finds him sitting in his underpants with his paintball helmet still on.
__Penny Sheldon, honey, I've told you, it's a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.
__Sheldon Please, please, I don't have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.
__Penny Get rid of her how?
__Sheldon I don't know, but apparently I'm in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.
__Penny Excuse me?
__Sheldon I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
__Penny Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.
__Ramona Dr. Cooper?!
__Sheldon Hide me.
__Penny Hide you?
__Sheldon I formally request sanctuary.
__Ramona Why aren't you working?
__Sheldon Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don't have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.
__Penny Oh, man.
__Ramona I know what's going on here.
__Penny Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?
__Ramona You're in love with Dr. Cooper.
__Penny Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.
__Ramona Don't try to deny it. He's a remarkable man, but you have to let him go.
__Penny Oh, gee, okay.
__Ramona I know it's hard, but he's a gift to the whole world, and we can't be selfish.
__Penny Yeah, he's a gift all right.
__Ramona Sisters?
__Penny Um, sure, sisters.  Holy crap on a cracker.
__Sheldon It's Morse code.
__Leonard Why?
__Leonard We are communicating through the wall.
__Sheldon Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.
__Leonard I don't know Morse code.
__Sheldon It's very simple. This is A  this is B (knock knock-knock-knock) this is C…
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm not going to learn Morse code at three o'clock in the morning!
__Sheldon All right.
__Leonard Don't come in here, don't come in here, don't come in here, don't  Aw! What's going on?
__Leonard I know. When is she going home?
__Sheldon Never, that's the problem. I need your help.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Leonard That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that's taking over the Earth.
__Sheldon Come on! Don't nitpick!
__Leonard Good night.
__Sheldon Shh. All right, I'm invoking our bodysnatchers clause.
__Leonard The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who's been replaced with an alien pod.
__Sheldon Yes. She's in the living room. Go, I'll wait here.
__Ramona Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
__Sheldon Now! Do it!
__Ramona You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.
__Sheldon Godzilla clause?
__Leonard Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
__Sheldon Rats.
__Ramona It's unbelievable! It's paradigm-altering!
__Sheldon And I could not have done it without you.
__Ramona Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.
__Sheldon It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?
__Ramona Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?
__Sheldon Who's Nowitzki?
__Ramona I'm Nowitzki.
__Sheldon Oh, you want me to share credit?
__Ramona Uh-huh.
__Sheldon Get out!
__Ramona Oh, bite me!
__Penny Sisters?
__Sheldon Maybe when I publish it, I'll include an inhaler.
__Kathy Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?
__Sheldon Let's see, today's Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo's. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.
__Kathy Great. I'll bring it to your place. I have the address.
__Sheldon What a nice girl.
__Sheldon Yes, I'm getting a free pizza. I'm on a roll.
__Howard Sheldon, you've already had four servings.
__Raj You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.
__Sheldon Just one more bite.
__Leonard Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
__ That's it. No more Thai food.
__Leonard Okay, I have pokh.
__All Have it. Got it.
__Leonard Potl.
__All Yup. Have it. Have it.
__Leonard Pukhpa.
__All Have it. Got it. Yup.
__Howard I have Chorrr.
__Raj & Sheldon Raj & Got it. Yup.
__Howard Nekhmakh.
__Raj & Sheldon Raj & Yeah. Yeah.
__Howard And Kreplach.
__Raj Hold on a second. Kreplach?
__Howard Yeah.
__Raj That isn't Klingon, it's Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.
__Howard Well, as it turns out, it's also a Klingon word.
__Leonard Really? Define it.
__Howard Kreplach, A hearty Klingon… dumpling.
__Raj Judge's ruling?
__Sheldon Bilurrrbe.
__Penny Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.
__Penny I don't know, it just died, I'm getting a bunch of static.
__Howard Did you pay your cable bill?
__Penny You sound just like the cable company. All right, so, shh, Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  America's Next Top Model.
__Sheldon Excuse me, Penny, but we're…
__Leonard No, no, don't tell her.
__Sheldon …playing Klingon Boggle.
__Leonard Aw!
__Howard What do you mean, aw? Like she didn't know we were nerds?
__Sheldon All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please.
__Penny Fine.
__Sheldon All right, Boggle warriors, kapla'!
__Howard Look at those women.
__Leonard They're gorgeous.
__Sheldon Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that's a proper noun.
__Howard Oh, look, the's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.
__Leonard Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.
__Sheldon Is qochbe' spelled with a  or a ?
__Howard Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?
__Penny Oh. That's Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.
__Howard House? What house?
__Penny They all live in a house together.
__Howard A house, where?
__Penny I don't know. Somewhere in L.A.
__Howard Wait a minute, you're telling me that I'm within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?
__Penny Yeah, I guess.
__Leonard Hey, wh-where are you going?
__Penny To pay my cable bill.
__Sheldon All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?
__ Credits Sequence.
__Raj Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.
__Howard Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.
__Leonard Sheldon, the food's here.
__Raj There's the house, freeze frame, freeze frame.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Leonard Why?
__Howard Isn't it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.
__Sheldon Is my hamburger medium well?
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Individual relish packets?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Onion rings?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Extra breading?
__Sheldon What did they say?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Did you protest?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Vociferously?
__Sheldon Well, then what took you so long?
__Leonard Just eat.
__Penny Hey, guys, what'd I miss? What'd I miss?
__Howard Giselle's hanging by a thread.
__Penny Oh, good, I hate her.
__Howard Then you're not invited to our wedding.
__Leonard Here you go.
__Penny Thank you.
__Sheldon Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?
__All Yes.
__Sheldon You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
__Leonard Put it on the agenda.
__Sheldon But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
__Leonard Oh, I'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it.
__Sheldon Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.
__Penny Oh, Giselle's not getting kicked off. It's totally going to be Summer. (She picks up one of Sheldon's onion rings. Raj lets out a high pitched squeak and points.) What?
__Leonard Sheldon's onion ring. Just put it back!
__Penny It's one onion ring.
__Howard Just put it back before he comes!
__Leonard No, no, no,  no, I don't think that's where it was.
__Howard Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.
__Sheldon Who touched my…
__All Penny! Penny did it.
__Sheldon Why would you do that?
__Penny All right. Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry.
__Sheldon Well, I'm sorry, but that is your second strike.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon You have two strikes. Three strikes and you're out. It's a sports metaphor.
__Penny A sports metaphor?
__Sheldon Yes, baseball.
__Penny All right, yeah, I'll play along. What was my first strike?
__Sheldon March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
__Penny I did?
__Sheldon The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
__Penny Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats.
__Sheldon I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.
__Leonard Don't worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
__Howard You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.
__Penny Come on, I touched one onion ring.
__Sheldon And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.
__Penny Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?
__Sheldon Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you've become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.
__Leonard Congratulations. You're officially one of us.
__Howard One of us, one of us.
__Penny Well, what a thrill.
__Sheldon You're sitting in my spot.
__Penny Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.
__Sheldon Leonard, she's in my spot.
__Penny I don't care. I'm taking a stand. Metaphorically.
__Sheldon All right, that's it. Strike three.
__Penny Ooh, strike three.
__Leonard Listen, don't worry. I'll talk to him.
__Penny Yeah, you do that.
__Leonard Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!
__Raj Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.
__Howard When we find it, you want to go with us?
__Leonard To do what?
__Raj Party with the pretty girls, dude!
__Howard That's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.
__Sheldon No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.
__Howard Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America's top models.
__Raj And a large number of people will believe it never happened.
__Penny Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover's pizza, no meat. Coming right up.
__Sheldon Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
__Penny Oh, I didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
__Penny Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don't like your attitude.
__Sheldon You can't do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.
__Penny Yeah, no, there's a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.
__Howard I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.
__Leonard Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Look, here's the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.
__Penny Really? Well, that's great.
__Leonard Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?
__Penny What? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase.
__Leonard Oh, come on, it's easy, he'll even tell you what to say.
__Penny Leonard, don't you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you're just encouraging him.
__Leonard We're not encouraging. It's more like knuckling under.
__Penny Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I'm not going to apologize for something I didn't do.
__Leonard Well, actually, technically, you did do it.
__Penny That's strike one, Leonard.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny Go ahead, eat it. I dare you
__Raj Are you sure?
__Howard Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.
__Leonard You can recognize people on Google Earth?
__Howard Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.
__Leonard NORAD? You're using military aircraft?
__Howard It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.
__Penny Okay, where is he?
__Leonard Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
__Penny Here. Try and go online.
__Leonard Problem with the WiFi?
__Penny No, just try.
__Sheldon Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.
__Penny Well?
__Leonard I reiterate, knuckle under.
__Penny No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.
__Leonard Oh, Penny, you don't want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.
__Penny I don't care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.
__Howard No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.
__Leonard There, see? Problem solved.
__Howard Voila!
__Sheldon Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.
__Leonard Thanks a lot, Howard.
__Howard What are you complaining about? I'm the one who has to take the class again.
__Penny Time to do your laundry, huh?
__Sheldon It's Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
__Penny I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.
__Sheldon What are you implying?
__Penny I'm implying that you're a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant.  Knuckle under, my ass.
__Sheldon No problem, I'll just do my laundry another night.
__Penny Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
__Sheldon Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.
__Penny Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.
__Sheldon Yes?
__Penny Where are my clothes?
__Sheldon Your clothes?
__Penny Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.
__Sheldon Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?
__Penny Sheldon, where are my clothes?
__Sheldon You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?
__Penny How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
__Sheldon When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!
__Penny Get them down.
__Sheldon Apologize.
__Penny Never.
__Sheldon Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.
__Penny Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I've done some stupid things, you've done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
__Penny Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.
__Sheldon I am meeting you halfway, I'm willing to concede that you've done some stupid things.
__Leonard Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?
__Penny Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it's junior rodeo on.
__Leonard Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?
__Sheldon I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.
__Leonard A-a-a-aw!
__Sheldon Mwah-ha-ha.
__Leonard No. Look, this has to stop.
__Penny Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.
__Leonard All right, I really didn't want to do this, but… here.
__Leonard Sheldon's Kryptonite.
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Leonard He can never know that I gave that to you.
__Penny Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?
__Leonard It'll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
__Howard God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.
__Leonard Okay, for the record what you're doing is really creepy.
__Howard You know what? If it's creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I'm creepy.
__Leonard Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I'll get him. Sheldon, it's for you.
__Sheldon Who is it?
__Leonard Your mother.
__Sheldon Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that's not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don't think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you're right, I don't really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?
__Leonard Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
__Penny Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that's, that's not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny Good night, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Penny.
__Penny Yes?
__Sheldon Well played.
__Penny Thank you.
__Sheldon with great power comes great responsibility.
__Penny Understood.
__Howard Yes, we here to fix the cable.
__Model I think we have satellite.
__Howard That's what I meant.
__Model Oh. Okay, come on in.
__Howard She's taller than all the women in my family combined.
__Raj What do we do now?
__Howard Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.
__Raj I don't want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
__Sheldon How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
__Raj Simple subtraction will tell you it's six better.
__Leonard Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
__Sheldon In what sense is that a compromise?
__Leonard Well, five is partway between three… Never mind.
__Raj I'll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
__Sheldon Ooh, I don't think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
__Raj What?
__Sheldon It's very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
__Raj Okay, I think I got it.
__Together Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock!  Oh!
__Howard Hello, boys.
__Leonard Ahoy, matey.
__Howard Noticed the eye patch, did you? It's all part of a technique I've been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.
__Sheldon Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.
__Leonard Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.
__Howard Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.
__Raj What are negs?
__Howard A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I've got a whole list of 'em. Who wants to be my wingman?
__Leonard You're not gonna need wingman, you're gonna need a paramedic.
__Penny Howard, your scooter's blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?
__Howard Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair?
__Penny Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.
__Howard Ow.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Well, I want to watch it now.
__Sheldon Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
__Leonard Watch whatever you want.
__Raj I saw what you did there.
__Sheldon What did I do?
__Leonard Hello. Hey, Howard. What's wrong? Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.
__Sheldon What happened?
__Leonard Howard's at the Mars Rover lab. He says he's in trouble. Defcon 5.
__Sheldon Defcon 5? Well, there's no need to rush.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
__Leonard How can 5 not be worse than 1?
__Raj Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.
__Sheldon Okay, first of all, that's a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.
__Raj Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
__Sheldon No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.
__Leonard Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
__Raj Star Trek V!
__Raj I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
__Howard Oh, thank God, you're here.
__Leonard What's the emergency?
__Howard I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
__Sheldon Where?
__Howard On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
__Woman Howard, is everything okay?
__Howard Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.
__Sheldon You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
__Howard Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She's a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won't care she's not Jewish.
__Leonard Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?
__Howard No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How'd you like to visit a secret government facility?”
__Sheldon So what exactly do you want us to do?
__Sheldon Really? They don't let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
__Howard Yes, I was bad. Maybe she'll spank me. Can we please move on?
__Girl Hey, Howard, you know, it's getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?
__Howard Yeah. No. I'm sorry, but something's come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.
__Girl Oh, okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.
__Howard I'll call ya.
__Girl Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?
__Leonard No one's a scientist like Howard.
__Howard My mother is so gonna love her.
__Sheldon Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.
__Leonard Just said Howard's a terrific guy. He's got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.
__Girl I really like that you're such a loyal friend.
__Leonard Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?
__Girl Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.
__Leonard Then why did you?
__Girl He said that I could drive a car on Mars.
__Leonard Got it. So, can I see you again?
__Leonard Ooh. Cool.
__Raj Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.
__Sheldon I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
__Howard Hang on, there's got to be other options.
__Raj You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA's latest timetable, they won't get there for 35 years.
__Sheldon Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
__Raj Oh, snap.
__Sheldon Snap what?
__Howard OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
__Raj What's Plan B?
__Howard Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.
__Sheldon Why wasn't that Plan A?
__Howard Thank God for Plan B.
__Penny Howard, didn't you say you worked on the Mars Rover?
__Howard No, you're mistaken.
__Penny Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.
__Howard I don't know what you're talking about.
__Leonard Psst! Psst!
__Sheldon Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he'd like to talk to me in private.
__Penny No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.
__Howard Well, that does sound like me, but no.
__Sheldon Is there some problem?
__Leonard Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.
__Sheldon All right, goodbye.
__Leonard No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.
__Sheldon Where are you going?
__Leonard I can't tell you that.
__Sheldon Who would ask me?
__Leonard I can't tell you that, either.
__Sheldon So you brought me in here to inform me that you can't tell me where you're going and you can't tell me who might ask?
__Leonard Yeah, I really didn't think this through.
__Sheldon Leonard, a moment.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon If someone, and of course, we don't know who this would be, does ask where you've gone, what should I say?
__Leonard I don't know. Just tell them I went to the office.
__Sheldon Are you going to the office?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Then how can I say it convincingly?
__Leonard Just say, Leonard went to the office.
__Sheldon All right. Leonard went to  the office.
__Leonard What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.
__Sheldon This would have worked out a lot better if you'd just told me you were going the office.
__Leonard I'm going to the office.
__Sheldon See? Why don't I believe you?
__Leonard I'm going out for a while.
__Penny Okay, where is he going?
__Sheldon Leonard is going to  the office.
__Girl Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.
__Leonard I'm hoping that's three different guys.
__Girl No, just the one. He didn't make it. So, how was your day?
__Leonard Oh, you know, I'm a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.
__Girl That's it?
__Leonard Well, I wrote some of it down.
__Girl Are you done eating?
__Leonard Uh, yeah.
__Girl Oh, good.
__Leonard If I knew you were waiting, I would've swallowed that lasagna whole.
__Phone rings. Answering machine You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
__Howard Hey, Steph, it's me again, Howard. Listen, if you're free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It's Howard.
__Leonard I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
__ Time shift
__Leonard That's a good idea. There's a bed in there, and I'm very, very, very pro-bed.
__Phone rings. Answering machine You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
__Howard Hey, it's me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you're half-Jewish on your mother's side. Okay, call me. It's Howard.
__Leonard Don't you think we should tell him you're not interested?
__Steph Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?
__Leonard Dear God, no!
__ Time shift
__ Oh, Leonard…
__Phone rings. Answering machine You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
__Howard Hey, it's me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we're gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.
__Howard I'll call you back when we firm up the details. It's Howard.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny New shirts?
__Leonard Yeah, a couple.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny So, who's the girl?
__Leonard I'm sorry?
__Penny Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.
__Leonard So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?
__Penny Well, yeah, we did have a date.
__Leonard Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.
__Penny So, who is she?
__Leonard Oh, she's a doctor.
__Penny Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
__Leonard Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he's dating someone, but he's not because, in fact, you're dating her, does that make you a bad person?
__Penny Well, that depends.
__Leonard On what?
__Penny Is that friend Wolowitz?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Screw him. You're fine.
__Leonard Are you sure?
__Penny Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.
__Leonard Does that change things?
__Penny No.
__Leonard So why'd you ask?
__Penny I'm nosy. See ya.
__Howard Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea!  Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?
__Howard's Mother Howard' Who is it?!
__Howard It's Leonard!
__Howard's Mother Howard' You're gonna have to play outside! I'm not dressed to receive!
__Howard No one cares, Ma! So, what's up?
__Leonard Listen, I need to talk to you about something.
__Howard Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried… Oh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… No, I understand… Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too.  You are dead to me.
__All Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
__Sheldon Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.
__Howard How do we decide that?
__All Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj Hey.
__Leonard Hi, Howard. Howard?
__Howard Sheldon.
__Sheldon Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.
__Leonard That's just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
__Sheldon I don't make the rules, Leonard.
__Leonard Howard, come on, I didn't plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.
__Howard Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
__Sheldon I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
__Raj You know, screw it, I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.
__Leonard Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.
__Steph Is this a bad time?
__Leonard Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so…
__Howard Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead to Me.
__Steph Hello, Howard.
__Howard Sheldon?
__Sheldon Look I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I'm out.
__Leonard He just won't listen to me.
__Steph Okay, I guess it'll just be the three of us then.
__Leonard Hmm. Lisa's gonna be disappointed.
__Steph Yeah.
__Howard Lisa?
__Steph Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.
__Howard Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive, it's a miracle!
__Leonard Howard, Howard, look at this.
__Howard Anyway, call me. It's Howard.
__Voice from TV The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It's unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing's certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It's a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we'll never know who's responsible.
__Howard Son of a bitch.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon What is shaking?
__Penny I'm sorry?
__Sheldon It's colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?
__Penny What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.
__Sheldon I'm striking up a casual conversation with you. S'u'up?
__Sheldon All right, But I'm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.
__Penny So, this wasn't the awkward part?
__Sheldon No.
__Sheldon Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?
__Penny Okay, feeling the awkward now.
__Sheldon Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
__Penny Yeah, Leonard told me.
__Sheldon Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
__Penny To you?
__Sheldon Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard's been involved with, she's the only one I have ever found tolerable.
__Penny Well, what about me?
__Sheldon The statement stands for itself.
__Penny Well, aren't you sweet?
__Sheldon Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.
__Penny Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.
__Sheldon You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you're sitting in your apartment, it's late, you're alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it's referred to by today's urban youth.
__Penny Really?
__Sheldon Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.
__Penny I could think about you.
__Sheldon Fine, whatever works.
__Penny Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Uh, peace out!
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
__Sheldon And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.
__Sheldon You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.
__Steph That's very interesting.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Leonard She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.
__Sheldon Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I'll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
__Steph No.
__Sheldon Good. What's your favourite fruit?
__Steph Ih-uh, strawberries.
__Sheldon Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?
__Steph Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.
__Sheldon Really? That's where I was born!
__Steph You're kidding!
__Sheldon I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.
__Steph Why, what-what-what happened?
__Sheldon Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
__Steph I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?
__Sheldon No, I didn't try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner.
__Sheldon Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  Look at that, there's even pasta left over.
__Leonard Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
__Sheldon I do. Do you? Because frankly, you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.
__Leonard Okay, here's my question, why did you sit down?
__Sheldon To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.
__Leonard What landing party?
__Sheldon You're Kirk, I'm Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we've got McCoy.
__Leonard Oh, my god, what did you do?
__Steph What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!
__Sheldon I have a bone to pick with you, sir.
__Leonard Oo-oo-oh!
__Steph Hi, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hi, Stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.
__Leonard What invitation?
__Sheldon We're going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn't have done a better job.
__Leonard Oh, clearly I could have.
__Sheldon It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I'll find us seats.
__Steph No, no, we have seats.
__Steph What is he doing?
__Leonard He's finding the acoustic sweet spot.
__Steph Does he always do this?
__Leonard Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
__Steph No, it's fine. you know, he's sweet.
__Sheldon My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?
__Leonard No, just sit here.
__Sheldon Oh, yeah, this is it.
__Leonard What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Tell me what you see here.
__Leonard The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
__Sheldon This is Stephanie's facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?
__Leonard Stephanie Barnett is single.
__Sheldon Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who's Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?
__Leonard It's just her facebook page and we've only been going out a couple of weeks.
__Sheldon You don't see it, do you? We're losing her.
__Leonard Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.
__Sheldon I'm afraid I can't allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.
__Leonard General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.
__Sheldon Give me one good reason why not.
__Leonard Because this is not Star Trek
__Penny What?
__Sheldon This is banana bread.
__Penny This is a door knob.
__Sheldon It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
__Penny Sheldon, would you like to come in?
__Sheldon I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon How can you be sure?
__Penny Sheldon, what do you want?
__Sheldon I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.
__Penny He's having problems with Stephanie?
__Sheldon She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.
__Penny We never got to the bedroom.
__Sheldon Because?
__Penny Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I'll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.
__Sheldon It's not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?
__Raj You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
__Howard I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
__Sheldon More to the point, it's about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.
__Howard Oh, I don't think you can.
__Sheldon Well, why not?
__Howard Look at Leonard's record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
__Raj During which she defected to North Korea.
__Howard Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
__Raj For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
__Howard And a three hour dinner with Penny.
__Raj Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
__Howard Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.
__Sheldon Yes, I'm aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
__Raj Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.
__Howard I'll tell you what you shouldn't do. Don't spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn't work at all, no matter how much you put on.
__Sheldon So, that's all you've got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?
__Howard Yes.
__Raj Yeah.
__Penny What?
__Penny Oh, thank you.
__Sheldon May I come in?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
__Penny Well, thank you.
__Sheldon So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
__Penny What?
__Sheldon I've been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he's being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in  Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.
__Steph Leonard, you're going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.
__Sheldon Oh, hi Stephanie.
__Leonard Want some more wine?
__Steph Yeah, I assume I'm not driving anywhere tonight.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
__Leonard Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
__Sheldon I'm helping you with Stephanie.
__Leonard By making constipated moose sounds?
__Sheldon When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.
__Leonard Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
__Sheldon Yes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes. I'm not strong enough, Leonard, you'll have to do it.
__Leonard Oh, for god's sakes.
__Sheldon Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.
__Steph Do you want some help with that?
__Leonard No, no, no, I got it.
__Sheldon No, yeah, yeah, he's got it, and that's not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it.
__Steph Oh my god, are you okay?
__Leonard No, I'm not. I'm bleeding.
__Sheldon Like a gladiator!
__Steph Oh, honey, you're going to need stitches.
__Leonard Stitches? With a needle?
__Steph Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.
__Leonard Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.
__Sheldon FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.
__Leonard I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.
__Sheldon Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.
__Leonard I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.
__Sheldon Watery?
__Leonard She stuck a needle into my hand!
__Leonard I didn't cry.
__Steph Okay, I'm just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it's all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?
__Leonard Oh, are you still going to spend the night?
__Steph Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.
__Sheldon She's right, as long as you're vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.
__Leonard Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
__Sheldon You're welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.
__Steph Okay, I'm going to go get your discharge papers.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you.
__Raj Can I see your stitches?
__Leonard Sure.
__Raj Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
__Leonard What for?
__Penny Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
__Leonard What? no. no, that's not right.
__Howard Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.
__Penny Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That's bold.
__Leonard It's not bold, it's a mistake. I didn't change my status.
__Penny Well, then who did?
__Sheldon I had no choice, he cried in front of her.
__Leonard You hacked my facebook account?
__Sheldon Oh, it's hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.
__Leonard Are you insane? Now she's going to think I'm desperate. You've destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don't even understand what you did wrong because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
__Sheldon In which I am not an expert.
__Leonard Don't even! I don't want to hear another word out of you.
__Penny What's wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well?  Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.
__Howard Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.”
__Leonard Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.
__Sheldon If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.
__Sheldon Well, you're the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.
__Leonard Me, too.
__Sheldon Is it a high-frequency whistle?
__Leonard No, it's more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.
__Steph Yup, there's no inflammation at all, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Then it must be a tumour.
__Leonard Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
__Sheldon Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
__Steph Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there's something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! I'm going to bed
__Leonard Okay, I'll be right in.
__Sheldon It's not enough that she mocks me, but that isn't even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.
__Leonard Do you understand that Stephanie's not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
__Sheldon How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don't think so.
__Leonard Good night.
__Sheldon Leonard, there's one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I'm calling an emergency meeting.
__Leonard No, you're not.
__Sheldon Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.
__Leonard We're not living together.
__Sheldon I beg to disagree. “A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un- all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights.
__Leonard That's absurd.
__Sheldon You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.
__Leonard Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
__Sheldon Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I'm given to understand women have different needs, so, we'll have to discuss that.
__Leonard I'm going to bed.
__Sheldon At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon It's not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
__Leonard I don't care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.
__Steph Hi, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.
__Leonard Oh come on! Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.
__Sheldon I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
__Steph He did very nicely.
__Penny Out of coffee. Need coffee.
__Penny Hi! Stephanie, right?
__Steph Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?
__Penny I'm Penny, I live across the hall. I've heard a lot about you.
__Steph Really?
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Steph I haven't heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven't I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?
__Leonard She's heard about you because we're, you know, involved and you haven't heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!
__Sheldon In Leonard's defence, it wasn't for lack of trying.
__Leonard Thank you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You're welcome, Leonard.
__Leonard Look, I'm just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it's very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
__Sheldon Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
__Leonard She doesn't like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…
__Steph Well, it was very nice meeting you.
__Penny Nice to finally meet you, too.
__Steph And I'll see you tonight?
__Leonard Okay, bye-bye.
__Sheldon What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
__Penny So, that's Stephanie, huh?
__Leonard Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam?
__Penny You know, she seems very nice.
__Sheldon Oh, she is. She's terrific, and she's proving to be a valuable roommate.
__Penny Roommate? You guys are living together?
__Sheldon Like hippies.
__Leonard We're not living together.
__Sheldon Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
__Leonard We're not living together.
__Penny Are you sure?
__Leonard How could I not be sure?
__Penny Well, let's find out.
__Leonard Don't you think if a woman was living with me I'd be the first one to know about it?
__Penny Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one to know about it.  Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!
__Leonard We're not living together.
__Penny Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?
__Leonard We're not living together.
__Penny Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?
__Leonard Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We're not living together!
__Penny You're going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.
__Leonard We're not… Where's my Bat Signal?
__Penny You have a Bat Signal?
__Leonard I did. It was right here. She must've… Oh, my God, we're living together.
__Penny Really? What was your first clue?
__Leonard Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.
__Howard Nice. Cotton?
__Leonard Actually, I think it's more of wool, fire ant blend.
__Howard So, the girlfriend's buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.
__Leonard It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.
__Howard Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There's a whole buffet of women out there and you're just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.
__Leonard At least I have an egg. What do you have?
__Howard A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can't.
__Leonard So, go hit on her.
__Howard She's not my type.
__Raj Too bad, 'cause she was checking you out before.
__Howard She was?
__Raj Of course not. Look at her.
__Leonard I don't care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.
__Sheldon Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
__Steph Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
__Sheldon My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.
__Steph Thank you.
__Sheldon Didn't they teach you that in medical school?
__Steph I'm kinda busy here, Sheldon.
__Sheldon I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
__Steph A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?
__Sheldon Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.
__Steph Go home, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
__Leonard Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?
__Penny Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?
__Leonard No, the pants that Stephanie got me.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, you can't machine wash these. They'll be ruined.
__Leonard Are you sure?
__Penny Absolutely.
__Leonard Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.
__Penny Are you guys having problems?
__Leonard No, everything's fine.
__Penny Really?
__Leonard Yeah. It's wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it's fine, it's great.
__Penny Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you're uncomfortable with the way things are going, you're allowed to say something.
__Leonard Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.
__Penny Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.
__Leonard No that doesn't sound right either.
__Penny Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
__Leonard Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I'll go do that. Thank you.
__Penny Sure.
__Leonard You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
__Penny You're kidding, right?
__Leonard No, but that's okay. I'll go talk to her. Want to come with?
__Penny Go! Wow.
__Sheldon Wha??
__Steph You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
__Sheldon I knew it! What do I do?
__Steph You're going to need to stop talking immediately.
__Sheldon For how…
__Steph Du-du-du-du! Immediately.
__Leonard Hey.
__Steph Oh, hi, honey.
__Leonard Sheldon.  What's going on?
__Steph I just performed a Sheldonectomy.
__Leonard Careful, if you don't get it all, it'll only come back worse.
__Steph Gotcha.
__Leonard Listen, we need to talk.
__Steph Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we “need to talk”?
__Leonard I don't know what that means.
__Steph Okay, why don't you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?
__Leonard Okay, um, well, look, it's just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.
__Steph And?
__Leonard It's just a little scary.
__Steph Well, yeah, but scary good, right?
__Leonard Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?
__Steph Uh-huh.
__Leonard Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?
__Steph Of course honey why don't you tell me what it is you're feeling?
__Leonard Okay, well, I ju… I think it's important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!
__Steph Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I'm feeling?
__Leonard What's that? Really? Right now?
__Leonard I just ate, aren't you supposed to wait an hour?
__Steph I think that's for swimming.
__Leonard Oh, okay. I just hope I don't get cramps.
__Steph Yeah.
__Penny Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Your pants are ruined.
__Penny So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?
__Leonard Well, um, on one level, really, really well.
__Penny So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?
__Leonard Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.
__Penny Good, good. And then what?
__Leonard And then the, the subject got changed somehow.
__Penny You had sex, didn't you?
__Penny Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.
__Leonard Yeah, yeah it's all good. Everything's going to work out. One way or another.
__Penny Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.
__Leonard Really?
__Penny Yes, you don't always have to go along with what the woman wants.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here's the thing, I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she'll just dump me.
__Penny Well, it's a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.
__Leonard Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?
__Penny I don't know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?
__Leonard I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?
__Penny Yeah, that'll slow it down.
__Leonard Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here's the thing. I really like you.
__Steph Oh, God, here comes the speech.
__Leonard What speech?
__Steph I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together ‘cause I need my space but I'll call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you don't call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you've been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you're lying, but I pretend like I don't care even though I'm dying inside!
__Leonard No! No, no! I wasn't going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.
__Steph Oh. Oh, good! ‘Cause I really like you, too.
__Leonard Terrific.
__Raj Hey.
__Howard Hey. Nice sweater.
__Leonard Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It's kind of fun.
__Raj It's got a big bird on it, dude.
__Leonard Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part. We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don't even know what a duvet is but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.
__Raj You're lucky. With me, it's usually the other way around.
__Howard You know, if you can't talk to her, why don't you just text her?
__Leonard Isn't that kind of cowardly?
__Howard Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.
__Raj It's true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.
__Leonard Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It's done.
__Howard Good for you.
__Leonard Yeah, good for me. I'll never have sex again.  I was wrong. See ya.
__Computer voice I have an inflamed larynx.
__Penny Okay?
__Computer voice We're out of herbal tea. Do you have any?
__Penny Okay, let me check.
__Computer voice Some hiney would be nice, too.
__Howard What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
__Sheldon Like what?
__Howard I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.
__Sheldon I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
__Raj Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.
__Leonard Raj, please, let's stay serious here. Superman's body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.
__Howard Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?
__Sheldon Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.
__Howard Okay, he's invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, “who's up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?” Superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.
__Raj Booya.
__Sheldon Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
__Raj “Kandorian dry cl…” I give up, you can't have a rational argument with this man.
__Howard Hey, isn't that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.
__Raj Then how?
__Howard Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.
__Raj I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?
__Howard No.
__Leonard It's David Underhill. So what?
__Sheldon So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
__Leonard I have two words for you. The first is big, the other's whoop.
__Sheldon It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you've done since you've been here completely useless.
__Leonard Did not.
__Howard Did, too.
__Leonard Did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.
__Raj In more ways than one. He's a very handsome man.
__Howard Doesn't do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I'm more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.
__Raj Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.
__David Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?
__Leonard Uh, yeah.
__David I'm David Underhill.
__Leonard Uh, y-yeah.
__David Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you'd be able to give me a hand?
__Leonard You want to work with me?
__David Well, if you have a little time, yeah.
__Leonard Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here's my home number, here's my cell, here's my office, here's my parents' number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So…
__David Okay.
__Leonard Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.
__David Thanks. I'll call you.
__Leonard Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You've never seen a hypocrite before?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Hey, guys!
__Howard That doesn't count. Do over! Do over!
__Sheldon There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
__Howard There are always do-overs when my people play sports.
__Sheldon Where were you that's more important than Wii bowling night?
__Leonard Actually, I was…
__Sheldon It's a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
__Leonard Come on, it's just a video game. And we suck at it.
__Sheldon Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
__Howard Where were you?
__Leonard I was working with Dave Underhill.
__Howard Ooh, “Dave.” Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.
__Leonard Actually, he's pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.
__Howard So? We're in a rock band.
__Leonard No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.
__Sheldon Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
__Leonard He's funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That's not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I'm gonna go practice my situps.
__Raj Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.
__Howard Yep. It's officially a bro-mance.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?
__Sheldon No, because we don't celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.
__Penny Saturnalia?
__Howard Gather round, kids, it's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas special.
__Sheldon In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.
__Howard And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.
__Penny Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I'll just put them under my tree.
__Sheldon Wait! You bought me a present?
__Sheldon Why would you do such a thing?
__Penny I don't know. ‘Cause it's Christmas?
__Sheldon Oh, Penny. I know you think you're being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven't given me a gift, you've given me an obligation.
__Howard Don't feel bad, Penny, it's a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.
__Penny Now, honey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.
__Sheldon Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you've given me. It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
__Penny Okay, you know what? Forget it. I'm not giving you a present.
__Sheldon No, it's too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.
__Penny Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
__Sheldon No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I'm going to need a ride to the mall.
__Howard It's happening to us.
__David Are you gonna make it?
__Leonard Yeah, I guess.
__David All right.
__Leonard Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
__David No problem.
__Leonard I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?
__David Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn't moving.
__Penny Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?
__Leonard Oh, yeah. It's just a little motorcycle accident.
__Penny My God, how fast were you going?
__Leonard I don't know. It's all such a blur.
__David Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn't even get it started. Hi. Dave.
__Penny Hi. Penny. So it's your motorcycle?
__David Uh-huh.
__David It's fine.
__Leonard Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.
__David You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?
__Penny Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?
__David I'm a physicist.
__Penny Ha-ha. No, you're not.
__David Why is that so surprising?
__Penny Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.
__Penny So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?
__David Yeah, actually we are.
__Leonard Yeah, we're examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.
__Penny Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.
__Leonard Since when?
__David The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.
__Penny Ha. Well, that's what I am, queen of the nerds.
__David Well, if you like, I could show you the lab we're working in. We've got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff.
__Penny You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.
__Leonard Since when?
__Penny Since always.
__David Leonard, are you okay here?
__Leonard Uh, yeah. I guess.
__David How 'bout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat…
__Penny Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.
__David Boy, she'll do, huh?
__Leonard Yeah, if you like that type.
__David So, you and her?
__Leonard No, just neighbours.
__David Really. I don't know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.
__Leonard Actually, science is my lady.
__Penny Okay. Let's go.
__David All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.
__Leonard See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun.
__Sheldon Yes?  Did you forget your key?
__Howard You're kidding. You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that's the estrogen hat trick.
__Leonard What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It's as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.
__Raj Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff, let's just go next door and build her a bear.
__Sheldon I told you before, bears are terrifying.
__Howard Come on, bath stuff, it's perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.
__Sheldon That presupposes Penny is tense.
__Raj She knows you. She's tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
__Howard Excuse me, we're ready.
__Sheldon No, we're not. Let's say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?
__Howard This one. Let's go.
__Sheldon You put no thought into that.
__Howard I'm sorry. Uh, this one. Let's go!
__Sheldon I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?
__Assistant Yes?
__Sheldon If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.
__Assistant Excuse me?
__Sheldon Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?
__Assistant I don't understand what you're talking about and you're making me a little uncomfortable.
__Howard See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We'll take it.
__Leonard Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.
__Penny Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!
__Leonard Yeah, I know. I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
__Penny I never said that.
__Leonard Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
__David This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.
__Penny Oh, shut up!
__Leonard Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don't you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn't going to detect itself.
__David Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny.
__Penny Really? We're going to do an experiment?
__David Uh-huh. We're going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.
__Penny It's not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
__David You ready to go?
__Penny Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
__David Yeah, why not? You can't do any worse than Leonard.
__Leonard That's funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
__Leonard Yippee.
__Sheldon You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.
__ Then I'll look up the price of her gift online, choose the basket closest to that value, give it to her and then I'll return the others for a full refund.
__ Brilliant.
__Sheldon It is, isn't it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.
__Leonard Do whatever you want.
__Sheldon Thank you, that's very gracious.     Gentlemen.
__Howard Why couldn't you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?
__Leonard My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
__Penny Why are you yelling at me?
__Leonard Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Never mind, we're cool.
__Penny Dave is not smarter than you. He's an idiot.
__Leonard Really? Why would you say that?
__Leonard He tried to take nude photos of you?
__Penny That's what you took from that? The guy is married!
__Leonard Oh, yeah. I'm so… oh, that's terrible.
__Penny And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?
__Leonard Well, uh, the important thing is he's married and that's terrible!
__Penny Nice save, genius. Eggnog?
__Leonard Lactose.
__Penny It's just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
__Leonard Smooth.
__Penny Smoother than you.
__Leonard Come on, it's Christmas, just give me this one.
__Penny Okay, Merry Christmas.
__Leonard By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
__Leonard Merry Christmas.
__Penny How's your leg?
__Leonard Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.
__Sheldon Ah, good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts. You'll be pleased to know I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.
__Penny Okay, here.
__Sheldon I should note I'm having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.
__Penny Turn it over.
__Sheldon To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.
__Penny Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.
__Sheldon I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
__Sheldon Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
__Penny Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Be right back.
__Penny Here. Open it.
__Leonard Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.
__Leonard Oh, then, I think you'll appreciate what I got you.
__Penny Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
__Leonard You know, 'cause you're so into science.
__ Sheldon! What did you do?!
__Sheldon I know! It's not enough, is it? Here.
__Penny Leonard, look! Sheldon's hugging me.
__Leonard It's a Saturnalia miracle.
__All MONTE.
__Howard Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.
__Sheldon Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
__Raj As with my father, I both love and fear it.
__Howard All right, enough chitchat, let's destroy something.
__Together One, two, three, go.
__Raj Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?
__Leonard Maybe we should start small.
__Raj Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what's inside the Magic Eight Ball.
__Sheldon Did it when I was four. It's an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
__Raj Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.
__Leonard How about the toaster oven?
__Sheldon What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
__Leonard What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.
__Howard Gentlemen, goggles.
__Sheldon Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.
__Raj How about “Die, toaster, die”?
__Leonard That'll do it.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Leonard?
__Leonard Uh-huh?
__Penny What the hell?
__Leonard Killer robot. We built it.
__Penny Yeah, well, it almost killed me.
__Sheldon If it wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.
__Penny So, who exactly does it want to kill?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?
__Penny You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.
__Howard It's a big deal. There's an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you'd like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
__Penny How is it supposed to be a dance if I'm the only girl?
__Howard Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You'd be the only doable girl.
__Penny You're a pig, Howard.
__Howard How is doable anything but a compliment?
__Leonard Howard, why don't we just work on the robot?
__Howard Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.
__Penny Our tango?
__Howard The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it's still… hot.
__Leonard I'm begging you, stop talking.
__Penny Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you're a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.
__Sheldon Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you're the one who's peculiar.
__Penny Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you're some sort of smooth-talking ladies' man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.
__Howard Um, so what are you saying?
__Penny I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It's not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we're not to'ing and fro'ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.
__Howard Wait a minute. This isn't flirting, you're serious.
__Penny Flirting? You think I'm flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you're just gonna grow old and die alone.
__Howard Thanks for the heads up.
__Leonard Howard, where you going?
__Howard I'm going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.
__Leonard Wow.
__Penny Well, someone had to say it. (Raj whispers in Leonard's ear) What?
__Howard Here's a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!
__Howard's Mother Howard' Hello? All right, hold on. It's your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you're not at school today!
__Howard I don't go to school, Ma. I work at a university.
__Howard's Mother Howard' That's a school! Now pick up the phone!
__Howard I don't want to talk to anybody.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?!
__Howard I don't have homework. I'm a grown man with a master's degree in engineering!
__Howard's Mother Howard' Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants. Want me to get you a Popsicle?
__Howard Cherry, please!
__Howard's Mother Howard' I ate the cherry. All that's left is green.
__Howard You make me want to kill myself.
__Leonard I don't know, now they're just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.
__Raj I'm not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.
__Kripke Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?
__Leonard Yes, we did, Kripke.
__Sheldon His name is Monte.
__Kripke Well, if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Wobot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.
__Leonard Come on, is that really necessary?
__Sheldon Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I'm given to understand that your mother is overweight.
__Raj Oh, snap.
__Sheldon Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.
__Raj What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
__Sheldon There are boundaries.
__Kripke Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let's settle this woboto a woboto.
__Sheldon What do you mean?
__Kripke There's no guawantee we've gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let's thwow down. You know, unless you're afwaid.
__Sheldon We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
__Kripke Tomowow, thwee o'clock, the kinetics wab.
__Sheldon Make it so.
__Leonard No, don't make it so. Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.
__Kripke What's wrong with him?
__Raj He's depressed because he's pathetic and creepy and he can't get girls.
__Kripke We're all pathetic and cweepy and can't get girls, that's why we fight wobots. If you're not there, you'll be exposed to widicule.
__Raj I'm curious, what part of America is that accent from?
__Leonard Hey, you got a minute?
__Penny Yeah, come on in. What's up?
__Leonard I need you to apologize to How…
__Penny Get out.
__Leonard Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
__Penny Well, then have the robot go and get him.
__Leonard The robot didn't hurt his feelings.
__Penny His feelings needed to be hurt.
__Leonard He's been in bed for two days.
__Penny Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.
__Leonard He's not with a… does it really matter who or what he's with? The guy is devastated.
__Penny Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?
__Penny What does that mean?
__Leonard You know, like, most of the time, you're the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!
__Penny I turn into a bear?
__Leonard Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn't get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.
__Penny And say what? That I didn't mean it, because I meant it.
__Leonard Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.
__Penny Oh, pthththth.
__Leonard Okay, let's try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.
__Penny Okay, come on, that's not fair.
__Leonard I came home with no pants.
__Penny Fine, I'll go over there tomorrow.
__Leonard Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
__Penny What about her?
__Leonard She's a delightful woman. You'll love her.
__Howard Who?
__Howard's Mother Howard' Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.
__Howard I don't want to talk to her.
__Penny Hey.
__Howard Ma!
__Howard's Mother Howard' She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?
__Penny So, I just came by to see how you were doing.
__Howard I'm fine.
__Penny Good. Your mom seems nice.
__Howard People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?
__Penny Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I've been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I'm sorry. Howard.
__Howard Fine, you're sorry. Good-bye.
__Penny So, you're okay?
__Howard Hey, I'm a big boy. I'm not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.
__Penny Okay. Well, bye.  So close
__Kripke As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.
__Raj I can't watch anymore.
__Leonard Sheldon, we have to call it off.
__Sheldon We don't have that option, we've accepted the challenge. We can't run away from a fight.
__Leonard Oh, please, we've spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.
__Sheldon Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.
__Raj Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke's robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.
__Sheldon You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we're up against and we can modify Monte so that he's prepared.
__Leonard You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
__Raj Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?
__Leonard Not yet.
__Sheldon Have faith, gentlemen. We don't need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?
__Penny Aw, that sounds sweet.
__Howard Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it's cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May…
__Howard I guess you'd say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin' 'bout Marcy…
__Penny That's great.
__Howard Grossman.
__Penny Oh, it's fun.
__Howard And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.
__Penny Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?
__Howard Look at me. What chance do I have if I don't try too hard?
__Penny Well, you'd have a terrific chance. I mean, you're smart, you're funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.
__Howard I guess.
__Penny Look, I'm telling you, I've known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I'm talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he's a nice guy.
__Howard You really think so?
__Penny Yes.
__Howard I don't know.
__Penny I do.
__Kripke I'm aware.
__Leonard What's this do, spin?
__Kripke Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.
__Leonard Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we've got to call this off.
__Sheldon No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.
__Raj But, Sheldon, we don't have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.
__Sheldon What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power.
__Raj That's not overconfidence, that's observation.
__Sheldon Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.
__Kripke What is his pwoblem?
__Raj Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.
__Leonard I just want to make sure that we're all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.
__Kripke Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.
__Sheldon He's right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.
__Kripke I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.
__Sheldon Never. I'd rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
__Kripke That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?
__Sheldon Do it.
__Kripke Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.
__Raj Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
__Sheldon Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us. (A flame begins to jet out of Kripke's robot.) That's new.
__Leonard Run, Monte, run!
__Raj Go, Monte! Go Monte!
__Leonard Go, go, go, go!
__Sheldon Don't hurt us, don't hurt us,
__Sheldon I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.
__Raj No one's arguing with you, dude.
__Howard I got your text. How bad is… Oy.
__Leonard Forget the robot. What happened to you?
__Penny He slipped and fell.
__Howard Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.
__Penny Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don't treat them with respect.
__Howard Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
__Sheldon So what do you think, Howard? It's not that bad, right?
__Howard Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I've seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.
__Sheldon You're right. Monte's gone. We'll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I'll speak. Leonard, you'll play your cello.
__Penny Sheldon, honey, aren't you getting a little carried away? I mean, it's just a toy robot.
__Sheldon Just a toy robot?
__Leonard Penny.
__Penny I know, I got it. Sheldon, I'm sorry.
__Howard Well, don't get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I'm halfway to pity sex.
__Sheldon First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant…
__Howard Hey, I'm thinking of growing a mustache.
__Leonard Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?
__Sheldon It is extracted from the plant…
__Howard I'm not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!
__Howard Oh, you'd think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.
__Leonard Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.
__Howard Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…
__Sheldon Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
__Sheldon It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn't do that anymore!
__Kripke Hey Hofstadter!
__Kripke Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults. Vewy impwessive!
__Howard What a jerk.
__Raj Don't feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results.
__Howard Even twenty thousand of 'em.
__Leonard Alright, please don't cheer me up anymore.
__Howard C'mon, don't let him get to you. It's Kripke.
__Raj Yeah, he's a ginormous knob.
__Howard That's why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table.
__Raj Fo' shizzle.
__Sheldon Hey it's true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.
__Leonard Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
__Sheldon Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!
__Kripke Yeah?
__Sheldon What'd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
__Kripke I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend.
__Sheldon Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don't you take some time to reconsider?
__Kripke Yeah, I'll do that.
__Sheldon Well I think we're off to a terrific start.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn't bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
__Leonard Yeah, I got the same one. And that's not a bathing suit, it's a tan line.
__Sheldon Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I'm leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef's salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef's salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I'm following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.
__Penny What's up with Ichabod?
__Leonard Oh he's trying to make a new friend.
__Penny Oh really? Well, good for him.
__Leonard Well, unless he's makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don't think it's gonna happen.
__Penny Well, how did you guys become friends?
__Leonard There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
__Penny And you moved in anyway?
__Leonard I assumed he was joking. You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
__Penny Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?
__Penny Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?
__Leonard I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
__Penny Oh come on, really?
__Sheldon First warning.
__Penny Hello Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hi.
__Penny What is this?
__Sheldon It's a questionnaire I devised. I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I'm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.
__Penny Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?
__Sheldon Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.
__Sheldon I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don't you just go ahead and write that number 1. I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.
__Penny Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
__Sheldon Only 211. Don't worry, in deference to you, I've kept them on a high school graduate reading level.
__Penny Thanks pal.
__Sheldon You got it, buddy.
__Penny Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don't know, pleasant?
__Sheldon Well that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
__Leonard I answered every question Sheldon.
__Sheldon You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
__Leonard Aw, you picked up on that huh?
__Sheldon How could I not?
__Leonard Come on! There's over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?
__Sheldon avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that I'd have better luck making friends if I wait 'til the Cylons take over? Please.
__Leonard Hold on. I put some real work into that!
__Sheldon Yes, well it's better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.
__Leonard It's kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.
__Sheldon What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.
__Sheldon I don't see how you could.
__Leonard What I'm trying to say is that, maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
__Sheldon What do you mean!?
__Leonard Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?
__Sheldon I did learn how to swim.
__Leonard On the floor.
__Sheldon The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
__Leonard Then why learn how to swim?
__Sheldon The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn't going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don't have to break new ground here, I'm sure much of the research already exists.
__Leonard No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.
__Sheldon That's insane on the face of it. Come on.
__Leonard Where are we going?
__Sheldon You're driving me to the mall. I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
__Leonard Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
__Woman in queue Thank you.
__Sheldon Family or friend?
__Woman Family.
__Sheldon Too bad. If it'd been a friend, I'm available to fill the void.  It's just as well, she smelled like moth balls.
__Leonard Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people, I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
__Bookstore employee Um, yeah but they're all for little kids.
__Sheldon I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
__Employee Uh, I guess. They're right over there by the wooden train set.
__Sheldon Oh! I love trains!
__Employee I bet you do.
__Sheldon Oh my! That's awfully sticky. Alright, let's see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It's probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn't you agree?
__Little girl I don't like birds, they scare me.
__Sheldon Me too! Most people don't see it. What are you reading?
__Girl Curious George.
__Sheldon Oh I do like monkeys!
__Girl Curious George is a monkey.
__Sheldon Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?
__Girl Okay.
__Leonard Sheldon, what are you doing?
__Sheldon I'm making friends with this little girl. What's your name?
__Girl Rebecca.
__Leonard No you're not, let's go.
__Sheldon We were really hitting it off.
__Leonard Don't look up, there's cameras.
__Leonard and Howard Lysine.
__Raj Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
__Sheldon Oh good! You're just in time. I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends.
__Leonard Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!
__Howard Hear him out. If he's really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.
__Sheldon See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.
__Raj Stu the cockatoo?
__Leonard Yes, he's new at the zoo.
__Sheldon It's a terrific book. I've distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
__Howard Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you're out of the apartment?
__Sheldon Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn't returned any of my calls because I hadn't offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… I see. Well then perhaps you'd have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… I see. No, no, no, wait. Don't hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I'm sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.
__Leonard Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.
__Howard I can fix it.
__Sheldon Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It's interesting. But isn't ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke.  A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that's brilliant! I'm surprised you saw that.
__Howard Gee. Why can't Sheldon make friends?
__Sheldon Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I'll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.
__Kripke Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.
__Kripke You afwaid of heights, Cooper?
__Sheldon Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?
__Kripke Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.
__Sheldon Little kid Hominids, perhaps.  Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.
__Kripke Let's go, Cooper.
__Sheldon Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that's to be expected. Hey, this isn't so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.
__Kripke Hey, look at you, Cooper. You're almost halfway to the top.
__Sheldon I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
__Kripke You alwight there, Cooper?
__Sheldon Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that's approaching an asymptote.
__Kripke Are you saying you're stuck?
__Sheldon What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
__Kripke Understood all that. I'm not a mowon. Just keep going.
__Sheldon Yeah, I don't think I can.
__Kripke Well, then. Cwimb back down.
__Sheldon No, that doesn't seem any more likely.
__Kripke So what's the pwan, Cooper?
__Sheldon Well, it's not exactly a plan but I think I'm going to pass out.
__Howard Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and… (Leonard, Howard and Raj whistle “Sweet Georgia Brown” together)
__Leonard It's a little thing but you really do miss it.
__Sheldon Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.
__Kripke Hewo to you, too.
__Leonard How was rock climbing?
__Kripke He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.
__Sheldon D-d-d! That's where I sit.
__Kripke Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?
__Howard How much time you got?
__Leonard Want some Chinese food?
__Kripke Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?
__Leonard In the bathroom.
__Kripke Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if I'm gonna eat Chinese.
__Penny Sheldon, are you okay?
__Sheldon Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.
__Leonard What's that?
__Sheldon Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I'm going to have to let one of you go.
__Howard Me, me. Let it be me.
__Sheldon Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.
__Leonard Can I whistle?
__Sheldon Don't be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you're not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.
__Sheldon No. You, too, are safe.
__Howard Oh come on. What do I have to do?
__Penny Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist. So just…
__Sheldon Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you're saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you're out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?
__Leonard He had Lysine but changed it.
__Sheldon Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.
__Kripke I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are open for new food.
__Penny Eww.
__Kripke Hewo. How did I walk past you? I'm Bawy.
__Kripke Yeah, it's not a vewy hot name. I'm gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers.
__Howard Suddenly I'm looking pretty good, huh?
__Sheldon So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.
__Kripke No.
__Sheldon No? But we're friends!
__Kripke I'm sowy. No, my fwiend?
__Sheldon I'm confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
__Kripke No, that's wong. There's an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.
__Sheldon Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you're back in. He likes monkeys.
__Leonard I didn't think he had it in him.
__Raj He almost made it to the top this time.
__Raj Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
__Howard There are too many variables. It would take forever.
__Leonard Why? They're state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.
__Sheldon Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.
__Raj What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
__Sheldon They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
__Leonard Well, it's gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.
__Raj We could eat after the movie.
__Sheldon Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occurring at work.
__Raj Hang on, hang on. There's a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.
__Howard Wow. I don't see how we missed that.
__Sheldon Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?
__Raj That's how we missed it.
__Leonard Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.
__Howard Okay, I guess we only have one option.
__Raj Yep, I don't see any way around it.
__Leonard Bye, Sheldon.
__Howard See ya.
__Raj Later, dude.
__Sheldon They're right, it was the only option.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Why?
__Penny Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.
__Sheldon Well, you didn't specify.
__Penny Is Leonard around?
__Sheldon He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I'm sorry, I don't understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?
__Penny The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven't paid my rent.
__Sheldon Oh, I see. Penny, I'm not sure I'm comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.
__Penny It's no big deal. I'm just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
__Sheldon If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago.
__Penny Well the “check engine” light is fine. It's still blinking away. It's the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
__Sheldon You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.
__Penny Yes, it occurs to me, too.
__Sheldon Hang on a moment.  Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
__Penny Wow, you got a lot of money in there.
__Sheldon That's why it's guarded by snakes. Take some.
__Penny Don't be silly.
__Sheldon I'm never silly. Here.
__Penny No, I can't.
__Sheldon Don't you need money?
__Penny Well, yeah, but…
__Sheldon This is money I'm not using.
__Penny But what if you need it?
__Sheldon My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.
__Penny Really? I mean, are you sure?
__Sheldon I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
__Penny Are they working on that?
__Sheldon I sincerely hope so.
__Penny Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can't. Sheldon honey, I don't want things to be weird between us.
__Sheldon Won't it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you're living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
__Penny I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
__Sheldon Of course you will. It's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
__Penny I'm regretting this already.
__Leonard Interesting.
__Sheldon Ask me why.
__Leonard Do I have to?
__Sheldon Of course. That's how you move a conversation forward.
__Leonard Why?
__Sheldon The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.
__Leonard Hey, Penny. How was work?
__Penny Great. I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
__Sheldon Was that sarcasm?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Was that sarcasm?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Was that sarca..
__Leonard Stop it!
__Sheldon Penny, you appear to have a package here.
__Penny Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.
__Sheldon Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women's fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
__Leonard He's not lying, he does find that fascinating.
__Penny Okay, whatever. It's not like I'm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?
__Leonard Weird.
__Sheldon Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn't sure.
__Leonard Did you guys have an argument?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.
__Sheldon I'm at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there's a blunder I overlooked.
__Howard It's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.
__Leonard Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.
__Penny Thank you, Leonard. What's my share?
__Leonard Don't worry about it. It's my treat.
__Penny No, really, how much?
__Penny Well, which is it, ten or eleven?
__Leonard Fourteen fifty, but it's no biggie, you'll get the next one.
__Penny What?
__Howard He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he'd get his shrimp lo mein for free.
__Penny What are you saying? That I'm using my body to get dinner? That I'm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
__Howard Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?
__Penny ‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don't rely on anybody!  What was that about?
__Howard He has a nervous bladder when he's stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.
__Penny Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.
__Leonard It was fourteen fifty, but it's okay.
__Sheldon Oh, good. Dinner's here.
__Penny Yes, dinner's here, and I'm having some. I'm having takeout food.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Penny You're damn right it's okay. I've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.
__Sheldon Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.
__Penny Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.
__Leonard Oh, wait, you lent her money?
__Penny She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
__Leonard Where are you going?
__Penny Going home, where I won't be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.
__Sheldon In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can.
__Penny Hey.
__Leonard A little mood lighting, huh?
__Penny Yeah. When I didn't pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.
__Leonard Yeah, they're very considerate that way.
__Penny I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.
__Leonard Fourteen dollars, huh?
__Penny Put it back in your pocket, or I'll find some other place to put it.
__Leonard Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back. It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to, you know, kill him.
__Penny Yeah, well, that's not really my big problem.
__Leonard So you're a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
__Penny Yeah, I know, it's just, this wasn't the plan, it wasn't supposed to go this way.
__Leonard Well, what was the plan?
__Penny Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.
__Leonard Was there a plan B?
__Penny TV star.
__Leonard It's probably not as bad as you think. Let's take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here's something, if you don't have electricity, then you probably don't need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?
__Penny Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes. I'm a professional actress.
__Leonard You've had an acting job where you got paid?
__Penny That is not the definition of professional.
__Leonard Actually, it kind of… let's keep looking. Whoa, what's eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?
__Leonard Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.
__Penny Well, remember Kurt?
__Leonard Your ex-boyfriend?
__Penny Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
__Leonard What?
__Penny He was drunk.
__Leonard I would hope so.
__Penny Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.
__Penny No, but he will.
__Leonard And that's based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
__Penny Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.
__Leonard Well what are you gonna do?
__Penny I don't know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.
__Leonard Oh, no. Oh, you don't want to do that.
__Leonard Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they're not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it's just, like… Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here?
__Penny Well, do you know anybody?
__Leonard Well, I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn't mind moving in with you.
__Penny Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you.
__Leonard Really?
__Penny And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
__Raj Leviticus 11:3: “Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”
__Howard Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?
__Leonard Hey, what's going on?
__Raj We're on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
__Howard You want the Valley of Fire? It's right here.
__Leonard Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?
__Sheldon Outside? I just made cocoa.
__Leonard – Come on. It'll be fun.
__Howard What is it?
__Leonard Do you guys remember Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?  Yeah, that's him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I'm gonna go get it from him.
__ Who's with me?
__ Ooh, double sixes.
__Leonard Really? You're just gonna let me go by myself?
__Raj Oh, cool, I got a sword.
__Leonard I could use some help.
__Raj Here.
__Leonard You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there's real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.
__Sheldon Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?
__Leonard I do.
__Sheldon Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don't.
__Leonard I'm not afraid of him.
__Sheldon All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.
__Leonard Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?
__Sheldon They did.
__Leonard Well?
__Sheldon They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.
__Raj Plus, no one stole their pants.
__Leonard Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I'll make this quest on my own.
__Howard Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it's spritzing a little.
__Leonard You guys suck.  Come on, please? He's so big.
__Howard Yes. Koothrappali's going to wet himself, I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's gonna run away, and you're going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?
__Leonard Guys, there are four of us and one of him.
__Sheldon Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
__Leonard Okay, how about this? I'll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.
__Raj I should've peed before we left.
__Kurt Yeah?
__Leonard Hi, Kurt.
__Kurt Lenny, right?
__Leonard I don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.
__Kurt No. What do you want?
__Sheldon You don't remember me? How could he not remember me?
__Leonard Sheldon, not now.
__Sheldon I remember him.
__Kurt And she sent you to get it from me?
__Leonard No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.
__Kurt You do?
__Leonard Feel is a kind of a… it's a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.
__Kurt She'll get it when she gets it.
__Howard Well, there you go. Problem solved.
__Raj A successful quest. Now let's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
__Leonard No, the problem isn't solved. He just blew us off.
__Sheldon I've got it. He didn't remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
__Howard Come on, Leonard, let's go
__Leonard No. You can leave if you want to. I'm gonna see this through.
__Howard Okay.
__Leonard I guess, technically, that was my fault.  I'm not leaving here without Penny's money.
__Kurt What happened to your backup?
__Leonard I don't need backup. I have right on my side. And I'm wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
__ Maybe we should have your head notarized.
__Raj If anybody cares, I still have to pee.
__Penny Hey, is Sheldon here?
__Leonard Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
__Penny Nice hat.
__Leonard It's kind of a fashionable look these days.
__Penny Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.
__Sheldon Hello, Penny.
__Penny Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.
__Sheldon Sarcasm?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Darn. I can't seem to get the hang of that.
__Leonard Hey, I know it's none of my business, but where did the money come from?
__Penny Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.
__Leonard Really? Did he say why?
__Penny Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.
__Leonard That's it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
__Penny Nope. I just think he's really changed. We're having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.
__Leonard Bye.
__Sheldon Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn't seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it's his nature.
__Leonard Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
__Sheldon That's your badge of honour, your warrior's wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.
__Leonard Great.
__Sheldon There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee.
__Howard Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.
__Penny You found it. It's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
__Leonard I'm really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.
__Penny What's that about?
__Howard Not a clue.
__Leonard Can't we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
__Leonard No, I didn't realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.
__Sheldon He's referring to an activity he has done before. It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.
__Leonard Aren't there any other options? There's not a lot of room, it's gonna be uncomfortable.
__Sheldon Yes, yes. Yeah, I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.
__Leonard Okay, bye. My mother's coming to visit.
__Howard How about that, you were right.
__ Credits sequence.
__Woman Yes, I can read the sign, I'm just pondering the implications.
__Penny I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.
__Penny You must be Leonard's mother.
__Leonard's Mother Leonard' Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.
__Penny Uh, I'm Penny. I'm his neighbour.
__Leonard's Mother Leonard' Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.
__Penny Oh, nice to meet you.
__Beverley Oh, you're a hand shaker. Interesting.
__Penny Uh, why don't you come with me. I'll walk you to the apartment.
__Beverley Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?
__Penny Yeah, sure, I guess.
__Beverley All right, you start.
__Penny Okay. You know, I've always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?
__Beverley Oh, I think you mean young. He's always been little.
__Penny Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?
__Beverley You'll have to be more specific.
__Penny Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.
__Beverley Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.
__Penny Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.
__Beverley Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.
__Penny Oh, well, I'm an actress.
__Beverley Why?
__Penny What do you mean why?
__Beverley Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.
__Penny Yeah, I don't know what that means.
__Beverley Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.
__Penny Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.
__Beverley Tell me about it.
__ Slight time shift.
__ I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!
__Beverley And then, I'm assuming, you entered adolescence.
__Penny Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn't Slugger anymore. Your mother's here!
__Leonard Good to see you, Mother.
__Beverley Oolong?
__Leonard Yes.
__Beverley Loose, not bagged?
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard Yes.
__Beverley Warmed separately?
__Leonard Yes.
__Beverley One teaspoon sugar?
__Leonard Yes.
__Beverley Raw sugar?
__Leonard Yes.
__Beverley It's cold.
__Leonard I'll start again.
__Sheldon I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
__Sheldon That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
__Beverley Yes, we think so. We've both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.
__Sheldon Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
__Beverley Well, it's all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.
__Leonard Here's your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?
__Sheldon The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
__Leonard Swell. If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation.
__Sheldon Aw…
__Leonard So, Mother, what's new?
__Beverley You'll have to be more specific.
__Leonard All right. Uh, what's new with you?
__Beverley Oh, well, I've been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.
__Leonard Maybe something less personal.
__Beverley Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.
__Leonard Oh, my God. What happened?
__Beverley His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.
__Sheldon What a remarkable woman.
__Leonard Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.
__Sheldon I envy you your childhood.
__Leonard I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
__Leonard Sheldon, you don't give your mother enough credit. She's warm, she's loving, she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.
__Sheldon You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.
__Leonard Please, don't go there, Howard.
__Howard I understand that unlike Leonard, they're at the top of their respective fields.
__Leonard Boy, you suck.
__Beverley Well, Leonard's younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.
__Howard So, she's close to curing diabetes?
__Beverley Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?
__Howard Wow, you must be very proud.
__Beverley Why? They're not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.
__Leonard Why are you doing this?
__Howard You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.
__Sheldon Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.
__Raj Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.
__Howard Oh, meesa think yousa lookin' so so sad.
__Leonard You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.
__Raj Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.
__Howard Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?
__Leonard That was fast.
__Beverley Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I'll have to try again later.
__Sheldon It's totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it's location, location, location.
__Beverley So, where were we?
__Leonard Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.
__Beverley That's fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliché.
__Howard It's just temporary, I pay rent.
__Leonard He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
__Beverley You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one's mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.
__Howard Say what?  That's basically what I just said.
__Leonard You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.
__Beverley Leonard, it's one o'clock, weren't you going to show me your laboratory at one o'clock?
__Leonard There's no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.
__Beverley But it's one o'clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o'clock.
__Sheldon Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o'clock.
__Leonard Fine. Let's go. I think you'll find my work pretty interesting. I'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
__Beverley So, no original research?
__Leonard No.
__Beverley Well, what's the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.
__Howard Just for the record, we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.
__Raj Well, then why didn't you say that to her?
__Howard Why is it always my responsibility?
__Raj It's not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.
__Howard I can't believe you're bringing that up.
__Raj I didn't bring it up. You did.
__Howard We'll talk about this later.
__Raj You always say that, but we never do.
__Sheldon You went to the comic book store without me.7
__Leonard You got alcohol?
__Penny Your mom still here?
__Leonard Yep.
__Penny Come on in. Wait, wait, she's not gonna come here looking for you, is she?
__Leonard Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.
__Penny Oh, my God. What happened?
__Leonard Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
__Penny Geez, what a fun couple.
__Leonard She's only been here a day and a half and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
__Penny Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I've been half bombed ever since.
__Leonard You can't let her get into your head.
__Penny My head, what about yours?
__Leonard It's too late for me. My head is her summer house.
__Penny She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.
__Penny I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I'll finally get my daddy's approval?
__Leonard Did you get the part?
__Penny No, they said I was too perky.
__Leonard Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?
__Penny Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go. Your mother told me.
__Leonard Of course she did. Anyway, that's not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.
__Penny A hugging machine?
__Leonard Yeah. I got a dressmaker's mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.
__Penny Oh, that is so sad.
__Leonard You know what the saddest part was?
__Penny What?
__Leonard My father used to borrow it.
__Sheldon I know. Although I've always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
__Beverley Common complaint among men. Nothing's ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.
__Sheldon I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
__Sheldon Oh, I can't believe that.
__Beverley Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.
__Sheldon My apologies. I've been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
__Beverley Understandable.
__Sheldon Can I make you a cup of tea?
__Beverley I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it's probably you.
__Sheldon I feel very comfortable around you.
__Beverley I feel very comfortable around you, too.
__Sheldon It's surprising because I generally don't feel comfortable around, well, anyone.
__Beverley Nor I.
__Sheldon What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
__Beverley Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?
__Sheldon I'd like to do the math.
__Beverley I'd like that, too.
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Penny You're gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.
__Leonard I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything after lick.
__Penny Neck, shot, lime.  Okay, shot, lime.
__Beverley I'm very tempted. I'm just not sure it's appropriate with my son's roommate.
__Sheldon Normally, I'd feel the same way. But based on everything I've observed about us, I can't help but speculate we'd be very good together.
__Beverley True. I've had a similar observation. It's certainly something I could never do with my husband.
__Sheldon I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It's quite satisfying.
__Beverley I see what you're doing. You're appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.
__Sheldon You see right through me, don't you?
__Penny Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
__Leonard You shush, I'm happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn't get as children.
__Penny Why would you bring that up right now?
__Leonard I don't know. Foreplay?
__Penny So you're saying you're not having sex with me, you're having sex with your mother?
__Leonard Ummm, I'm gonna go with “no.”
__Penny That is the sickest thing I've ever heard.
__Penny Oh, good morning.
__Leonard Morning.
__Penny Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.
__Leonard You don't have to. Ever.
__Penny Gotcha.
__Leonard Good-bye, Mother.
__Beverley Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?
__ Slight time shift.
__ I mean, my mom could've just said, “Bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on.” But she didn't. Not one word.
__Beverley Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?
__Penny Would it help?
__Beverley Well, it would help me.
__Raj God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.
__Howard Yeah, still funny, Raj.
__Leonard There's no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
__Howard But what about the creek bed?
__Sheldon The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.
__Raj Well, that's it then, we're doomed.
__Sheldon I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
__Howard I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.
__Sheldon And I told you I wanted to see a doctor's note.
__Raj We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
__Leonard I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
__Raj We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
__Howard No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
__Leonard No, that shouldn't be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They're probably just all staring at the sky.
__Sheldon All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth's Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.
__Howard Why don't I run away and you cover me?
__Sheldon Because you chose your mother's veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!
__Howard I had to take her! It's almost bathing suit weather!
__ I surrender! Don't shoot! They went that way!
__ Howard, I'm on your team.
__Howard Oh, Leslie, thank God.
__Leslie Where's the rest of your squad?
__Howard Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?
__Leslie Dead, all of them.
__Howard Sorry.
__Leslie Don't be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn't listen.
__Howard Well, we're surrounded, so I guess there's nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.
__Leslie Hmm, that's the worst part, the waiting.
__Howard All the while knowing that there's a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
__Leslie Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?
__Howard It kind of does.
__Leslie I say we make every moment count.
__Howard I agree. How exactly do we do that?
__Leonard Howard, why aren't you covering us? We're getting slaughtered out here!
__Howard War is hell.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Yeah, more cutbacks.
__Sheldon Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don't simply let some of you go so that there's money available for my research.
__Leonard You know what baffles me, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.
__Leslie Hey, guys.
__Leonard Hey, Leslie.
__Howard Hey.
__Leslie Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.
__Howard That's great, Leslie. Thanks.
__Leslie You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.
__Raj What was all that about?
__Howard Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.
__Leonard Yeah, okay, but what's with the back-scratching and the meow!
__Sheldon I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.
__Leonard Are you done?
__Raj You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking Howard wasn't making a back-scratching metaphor. I'm thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
__Leonard What about it, Howard?
__Howard Okay, I didn't want to say anything 'cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.
__Leonard I don't care about that.
__Howard Great, 'cause I've been dying to say something.
__Leonard You and Leslie?
__Howard In the paintball shed! Twice!
__Sheldon Is that why you didn't cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
__Howard Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
__Sheldon My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.
__Howard Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with. I mean, for free.
__Raj And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That's an expensive piece of equipment, dude.
__Leonard And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
__Howard Okay, one way to look at this is that I'm getting new equipment, and you're not, and that's unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I'm getting sex and you're not, and that's delightful.
__Leonard Calm down. We'll figure it out.
__Penny How can I calm down? I'm gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That's three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
__Sheldon Hello, Penny.
__Penny Hello, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You're in my spot.
__Penny Are you planning on sitting here?
__Sheldon No, I'm going to the comic book store.
__Penny Then what difference does it make?
__Sheldon What difference does it make?
__Leonard Here we go.
__Sheldon That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Don't sit in his spot.
__Penny Fine.  Happy?
__Sheldon I'm not unhappy.
__Penny Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.
__Leonard Okay, that should do it.
__Penny Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.
__Leonard That's a lot of shoes you ordered.
__Penny Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it's really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?
__Penny Oh, no, thanks. I'm from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it's because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. (Gun goes off and shoots three paint pellets onto Sheldon's spot.)
__Howard Well, it's partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.
__Leslie Sexy.
__Howard Can I assume that you likewise found the experience…
__Leslie Satisfactory?
__Howard That wasn't quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.
__Leslie Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?
__Howard Oh, it's great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.
__Leslie Isn't it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?
__Howard You know, most people don't get that.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Howard, I'm home!
__Howard Oh, great.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis's neck opened up again!
__Howard I'm busy, Ma!
__Howard's Mother Howard' Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?
__Howard Don't come in, Ma!
__Howard's Mother Howard' Why not?
__Leslie He's got company!
__Howard's Mother Howard' Is she Jewish?
__Howard Are you Jewish?
__Leslie No.
__Howard Yes!
__Howard's Mother Howard' Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!
__Leonard There's a chance.
__Penny Oh, what are we gonna do?
__Leonard We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.
__Penny Why do we have to tell him I did it?
__Leonard Well, we're not gonna tell him I did it.
__Penny Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.
__Leonard Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
__Penny I'm sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.
__Leonard We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
__Penny Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?
__Leonard Mm, butt print. There's no discernible butt print.
__Penny Oh, come on.  There, butt print.
__Leonard It's too small and too perfect.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard You're welcome.
__Penny Shh! Act normal.
__Leonard Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
__Sheldon Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
__Leonard Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It's a little chilly.
__Sheldon Koothrappali picked me up.
__Leonard Isn't that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
__Sheldon They don't talk incessantly for no particular reason.
__Leonard No, no, friends forgive the little things.
__Penny You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.
__Leonard Don't you dare, missy.
__Sheldon Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something's wrong.
__Leonard What do you mean?
__Sheldon I'm not sure. It doesn't feel right.
__Leonard I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.
__Sheldon Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?
__Penny Here we go.
__Sheldon That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don't eat in my desk chair and I don't work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.
__Howard You know, there's kind of an obvious solution here.  Get up. (Raj does. Howard moves his cushion across to Sheldon's spot) There. Problem solved.  Nobody cares where you're going to sit. You're not crazy.
__Sheldon Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog's head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?
__Leonard If it were your head, it would be.
__Penny Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it's only for a week. Can't you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn't really think that through.
__Sheldon You claim it's going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.
__Penny Why not?
__Sheldon Did you notice the sign on his counter? He's not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
__Leonard Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”
__Howard Ooh, looks like I'm gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby…
__Penny His right hand is calling him?
__Leonard No, it's Leslie Winkle. It's a long story.
__Howard I'll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.
__Leonard I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
__Howard What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There's a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?
__Howard Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.
__Leonard That's not fair. You're not even a physicist.
__Howard Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…
__Leonard Get out.
__Howard Bye.
__Howard Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.
__Leslie Hey, listen. Saturday my sister's getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It's black tie.
__Howard Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.
__Leslie Why not?
__Howard When I go to weddings, it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don't know what I would do with a date.
__Leslie Oh, all right. I understand.
__Howard Thanks.
__Leslie Hey, I'm really sorry about that Geneva trip.
__Howard What about it?
__Leslie Oh, didn't you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn't make the cut.
__Leslie About 12 seconds ago.
__Leslie Actually, I'm trying not to say it.
__Howard Okay, I'm sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.
__Leslie How so?
__Howard Because it's like you're controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
__Leslie Well, if I weren't controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I'd be uncomfortable.
__Howard How so?
__Leslie ‘Cause then we'd be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.
__Howard So, bottom line, I'm just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.
__Leslie No. No, not at all. You're also arm candy. So? What do you think?
__Howard's Mother Howard' Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?
__Sheldon This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
__Leonard I don't know. Texas?
__Penny Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.
__Leonard Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.
__Sheldon From that key maker, I highly doubt it.
__Penny Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.
__Sheldon There's one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
__Penny Sit on the damn couch.
__Sheldon Nope.
__Penny What do you mean, nope? What's wrong with it?
__Leonard Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.
__Penny It's exactly the same…
__Leonard Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.
__Sheldon More?
__Leonard I'm afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
__Sheldon Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
__Leonard Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
__Leonard Golden Dragon.
__Sheldon No. No, this isn't right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.
__Leonard Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.
__Sheldon But. Oh, this changes everything.
__Leonard I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
__Sheldon What's real? What isn't? How can I know?
__Penny You did make that up, right?
__Leonard Oh, God, I wish I had.
__Sheldon Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah, buddy?
__Sheldon I still don't like this cushion.
__Penny Thanks for the shoes.
__Leonard Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
__Howard What's the plan?
__Leonard Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we'll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.
__Sheldon Right, just one thing before we start.
__Leonard What is it, Sheldon?
__Penny What the hell?
__Sheldon That was for my cushion.
__Leonard Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.
__Penny Screw that.
__Sheldon She can't shoot me. She's dead.
__Leonard He's right. You can't.
__Sheldon Well, if we're going to descend into anarchy
__Howard Okay, see you.
__Leonard Where are you going?
__Leslie Surrender, then Denny's.
__Sheldon Stop. We can't do this, it's not right.
__Raj Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.
__Leonard Okay, then we won't touch the hard drive. We'll just erase the first season of Battlestar.
__Sheldon There. We're outlaws.
__Penny Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?
__Leonard It's perfect.
__Howard For taking daffodils to your unicorn.
__Leonard It's just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.
__Penny Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.
__Sheldon I understand your envy. This is a can't-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green's function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.
__Penny When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.
__Leonard This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
__Penny Oh, my God, the George Smoot?
__Leonard You've heard of him?
__Penny Of course I haven't.
__Penny It's kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.
__Sheldon It's like talking to a chimp.
__Penny Okay, now that I've been completely insulted, have a good flight.
__Leonard Yeah, I wish.
__Sheldon We're not flying, we're taking the train.
__Penny Oh, cool.
__Howard Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much.
__Penny Well, then why are you doing it?
__Leonard Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we're taking the train.
__Sheldon Don' we're taking the train!
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Oh, I always enjoy that, but I'm a little busy.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon I'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.
__Leonard Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?
__Sheldon Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.
__Leonard Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
__Sheldon I don't follow.
__Leonard I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.
__Sheldon Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.
__Raj Whatever it is, I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you'll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you'll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.
__Howard Come on, Raj.
__Raj What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Why not?
__Sheldon That's over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
__Leonard Sheldon, we've been on this train 90 seconds, and you've already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.
__Sheldon Here. I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.
__Leonard Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position 'cause it's time to land in San Francisco.
__Raj It's not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.
__Sheldon He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways' magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.
__Leonard Oh, look, now he's boring on an international scale.
__Raj Holy crap! Look!
__Leonard Is that who I think it is?
__Howard It can't be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?
__Leonard Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil Terminator.
__Sheldon Unlikely. That's a television show, Leonard.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that's Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don't kill me! I'm pro-robot! Ahh!
__Leonard At least he's off the train crap.
__Sheldon Whee!
__Howard Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I've actually got a shot at a Terminator.
__Raj Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you've got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
__Howard You're overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she's willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.
__Leonard My money's on tuck and roll.
__Sheldon I'm confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
__Howard Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.
__Sheldon All right.
__Howard That's Summer Glau.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Howard That's it.
__Raj Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
__Howard Um, well, let's see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first.
__Raj No, you didn't. I did.
__Howard Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober.
__Raj You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.
__Howard Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail.
__Leonard Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?
__Howard Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.
__Leonard You know, I've already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can't score with. I think I'll let you two take this one.
__Raj Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?
__Sheldon Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre…
__Raj Yeah-yeah, which way?
__Sheldon and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you're going as far as Portland.
__Leonard So aren't you going to go talk to her?
__Howard I will, I'm just working on my opening line.
__Leonard She's probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don't you just try hello?
__Howard No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that's funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.
__Leonard You're going to need more than 11 hours.
__Sheldon Oh, no.
__Leonard What's the matter?
__Sheldon I forgot my flash drive.
__Sheldon So we have to go back.
__Leonard Okay, Sheldon, I'm going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.
__Sheldon You don't understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.
__Leonard Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
__Sheldon It's brilliant. He needs to read it.
__Leonard So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back.
__Sheldon Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.
__Leonard Right. Of course.
__Sheldon Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.
__Leonard Well, there's nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.
__Sheldon You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive
__Leonard Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.
__ Time Shift.
__ It's hot in here. Must be Summer.  So, where you gals headed?
__Sheldon Okay, I've found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train.
__Leonard I've got a better idea.
__Sheldon Are you going to be sarcastic?
__Leonard Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Penny's home. Why don't we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?
__Sheldon But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon The key is hidden in my room.
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon Penny would have to go into my room.
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon People don't go in my room!
__Leonard I see. Well, it seems once again, you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.
__Sheldon Oh, I hate when that happens.
__Howard It's hot in here. It must be Summer. It's hot in here. Must be Summer. It's hot in here. Must be Summer.
__Raj It's hot in here. Must be Summer.
__Summer That's cute.
__Raj Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
__Summer Oh, yeah, I loved it.
__Raj It's loosely based on my life.
__Sheldon Listen carefully. I'm about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter.
__Penny Just a sec.  The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I'll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I'll see you then.  Hello?
__Sheldon Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?
__Penny Your dresser? Who is this?
__Sheldon It's Sheldon.
__Penny Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?
__Sheldon I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a train. Were you even listening to me?
__Penny Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what's up?
__Sheldon What's up? I'll tell you what's up. I'm in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…
__Leonard Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It's Leonard.
__Penny Hey, Leonard. What's going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?
__Leonard He's calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn't use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.
__Sheldon Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.
__Penny Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.
__Sheldon No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.
__Raj And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that's Venus.
__Summer That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.
__Raj Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.
__Summer You're not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?
__Raj You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he's one of those geeks.
__Sheldon All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It's a legal right
__ of access. Good grief. What? No, don't put me on hold. Oh!
__ Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he's M. Night Charmalarmalon.
__Leonard Is that what he's drinking? It's not even real beer.
__Howard What?
__Leonard Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
__Howard What's going on?
__Leonard I don't know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.
__Howard Placebo, you say. Interesting.
__Sheldon Yes, I'm still here. Where am I going? I'm on a train. Now, what you'll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman's sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman's Sphere. It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.
__Raj Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.
__Raj You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?
__Howard Raj.
__Raj Yes?
__Howard Look.
__Raj What am I looking at?
__Howard You tell me.
__Raj Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh
__Howard Hi, I'm the small package good things come in.
__Penny Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.
__Sheldon That's the wrong box. Put it back.
__Penny Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?
__Sheldon Don't read those letters!
__Penny Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.
__Sheldon Put down the letters!
__Leonard Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.
__Penny Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?
__Leonard Delightful. Listen, I don't know what you're doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon's mouth.
__Penny Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon I'm back.
__Penny What up, Moon Pie?
__Sheldon Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
__Leonard Hey, Penny. Leonard again.
__Howard So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?
__Summer I really don't know.
__Howard I'll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.
__Howard And did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?
__Summer No. I didn't.
__Penny Okay, I found the box. Now what?
__Sheldon You're holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You'll hear a slight click.
__Penny Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?
__Sheldon No, it's a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?
__Penny Not yet. There it is.
__Howard Okay, here's another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you'd be Summer Winter.
__Howard Okay, I'm going to just go for broke here and say I like you.
__Summer Yeah?
__Howard So here's my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you'd say yes?
__Summer No.
__Howard Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.
__Summer Thank you.
__Howard But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?
__Summer Sure.
__Howard Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we're making out?
__Sheldon Okay, now you're going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I'm nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck's mouth.
__Leonard Hey, how'd it go?
__Howard Terminator broke my phone.
__Leonard Excuse me.  Okay, I'll be honest with you. I've just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you're a human being; I'm a human being. I could just say to you…
__Announcer Santa Barbara.
__Summer I'm sorry. This is me.
__Leonard Hi, my name's Leonard.
__George Smoot With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?
__Sheldon Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva.
__Howard Oh, very nice. What's Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?
__Raj Let's find out. Leonard, ready?
__Leonard Ready.
__Raj Go.
__Leonard Damn it. I slipped.
__Howard Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.
__Sheldon Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.
__Leonard Why?
__Sheldon – Because it's almost eleven o'clock.
__Leonard So?
__All Ah.
__Howard Hey, you know what'd be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.
__Leonard Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don't want to see naked.
__Howard You underestimate me.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon It's eleven am.
__Penny I know. You're safe.
__Sheldon This package came while you were at work.
__Penny Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.
__Sheldon Excuse me.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon You have to sign this.
__Penny What is it?
__Penny Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.
__Sheldon Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?
__Penny It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I'm doing.
__Sheldon Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.
__Sheldon Obviously, not a cleaning business.
__Penny No, I'm making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.
__Sheldon Good for you. Sign here.
__Penny Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off, I won't have to be a waitress anymore.
__Sheldon But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
__Penny Another waitress.
__Sheldon What's her name?
__Penny I don't know.
__Sheldon And you're going to let her handle my food?
__Penny Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
__Sheldon I think you're just making that up.
__Penny Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don't want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.
__Leonard Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
__Penny Fine, cheeseburger.
__Penny So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?
__Sheldon How many of these can you make a day?
__Penny About twenty.
__Sheldon And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?
__Penny I don't know, like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.
__Penny That's all?
__Sheldon Before taxes.
__Penny Well, I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.
__Sheldon I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.
__Penny And you know about that stuff?
__Sheldon Penny, I'm a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.
__Penny Who's Radiohead?
__Sheldon I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
__Penny Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?
__Sheldon Of course I could.
__Penny Sheldon, wait! Will you?
__Sheldon Just to be clear here, you're asking for my assistance.
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
__Penny I understand.
__Sheldon And you're not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I'm doing so.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon Good. Let's begin with the premise that everything you've done up to this point is wrong.
__Penny Oh, imagine that.
__Sheldon Sarcasm. Good-bye.
__Penny No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Pretty good, right?
__Sheldon That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you'll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day.
__Penny A day?
__Sheldon There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
__Penny That just can't be right.
__Sheldon You're questioning my math?
__Penny No, sorry.
__Sheldon Want me to show my work?
__Penny Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.
__Sheldon All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc's 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.
__Penny Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.
__Sheldon That wasn't a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.
__Penny All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?
__Sheldon You're thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn't one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.
__Raj What's the matter?
__Howard I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.
__ From Penny's apartment they hear Penny and Sheldon singing “Blow the man down.” They enter to find Sheldon and Penny working together on the barettes.
__ Hello?
__Penny & Sheldon together Penny & Hello.
__Leonard W-W-Wait, what's going on?
__Sheldon I assume you're referring to the sea shanty. It's a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
__Penny Yeah, it's crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.
__Leonard Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.
__Sheldon Penny's making hair accessories. I'm helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break's over.
__Howard Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
__Sheldon Hot glue.
__Howard You're kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
__Sheldon It won't work, the flower's too porous.
__Leonard What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
__Sheldon Intriguing.
__Howard Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?
__Penny Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.
__Sheldon Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I'm thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.
__Howard Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.
__Leonard She'd need some kind of industrial cooling system.
__Sheldon Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.
__Penny Yeah, it's a bitch.
__Howard Uh, I've seen this before.
__Leonard Where?
__Howard It's a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.
__Penny Ew.
__Leonard Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
__Howard Actually, I'm thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.
__Sheldon Let's think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?
__Leonard & Howard Leonard & Oh!
__Penny I've got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
__Sheldon Wow.
__Leonard Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.
__Sheldon Oh, great. Raj, why don't you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don't you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I'll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.
__Penny Well, what's wrong with my apartment?
__Sheldon It's not my apartment.
__Penny Wait, wait, what am I going to do?
__Leonard Uh, hey, it's your business. Do whatever you want.
__Penny Oh, okay, cool. I'm going to take a nap.
__Howard Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.
__Leonard Okay, what's wrong with it?
__Sheldon – What's wrong with it?
__Leonard Not you. I wasn't asking you. Penny?
__Penny Uh, well, it's a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.
__Leonard No, it doesn't.
__Howard Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.
__Sheldon Penny, this is your enterprise, so it's ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I'd strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.
__Leonard You want to fire me?
__Sheldon What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny's decision. Penny?
__Leonard Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?
__Penny We do?
__Penny No kidding. Two?
__Leonard Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
__Penny Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.
__Sheldon Camouflaging bald spots. That's primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
__Penny How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
__Howard We add Bluetooth!
__Sheldon Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
__Penny Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?
__Sheldon Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.
__Leonard Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
__Penny Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
__Leonard The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.
__Sheldon Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.
__Sheldon We should get to work.
__Penny Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?
__Leonard Amazon offers one-day rush.
__Penny Yeah, but they don't have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?
__Leonard Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing. I'm just Web design.
__Penny Okay, well, I'm gonna have to call them and cancel the order.
__Sheldon Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.
__Penny I just don't see how see can pull this off.
__Sheldon Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?
__Sheldon Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night's work.
__Penny You guys get started.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Penny Going online to buy shoes!
__Howard Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father's a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.
__Raj We only had four servants. And two of them were children.
__Leonard How are we doing?
__Raj We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.
__Howard Oh, God, we're never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?
__Sheldon I believe I'm hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
__Penny So?
__Sheldon Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!
__Penny Nicely done.
__Sheldon Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.
__ Time shift
__ Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah…
__Howard Someone's in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow
__Penny Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah… Sheldon? Sheldon!
__Sheldon ‘Cause I sold my soul to the company store.
__Penny Honey, do you want some coffee?
__Sheldon No, I don't drink coffee.
__Penny Come on, but if you don't stay awake we'll never finish in time.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, coffee's out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.
__Penny Leonard, help.
__Leonard Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.
__Sheldon I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.
__Penny Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.
__Sheldon You're right, of course.
__Penny Here, this will help.
__Sheldon Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you're going to have to answer to my mother.
__ Time shift
__ Look at Planck's Constant. People say it's arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let's reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that's not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we're being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let's call it universe prime, there's another Sheldon, let's call him Sheldon prime…
__Penny We should have let him go to bed.
__Leonard Bam.
__ Time shift
__ I can't believe we actually did it.
__Howard 1,000 friggin' Penny Blossoms.
__Penny I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I'm going to give you 20 cents.
__Howard That's your entire profit margin.
__Penny Oh. Then never mind.
__Leonard I'll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
__Penny What?
__Leonard We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.
__Penny Really?
__Leonard One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
__Penny Okay, well. Guess we'd better get started.
__Howard You can't be serious.
__Penny Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?
__Leonard Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
__Penny Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I'm tired, I've had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who's with me?
__Howard Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives.
__Penny Leonard?
__Leonard Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.
__Sheldon Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where's the coffee?
__Penny We're all out.
__Sheldon No problem. I'll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!
__Howard Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.
__Sheldon Penny, please, we're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.
__Leonard Sheldon, it's not that bad.
__Sheldon Not bad? It's horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it'll happen to you.
__Leonard So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.
__Howard All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.
__Penny Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.
__Howard So, there is a number.
__Penny Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?
__Leonard Shh-shh-shh!
__Sheldon What?
__Penny The people upstairs are moving out.
__Leonard No!
__Sheldon The horror!
__Leonard Why would you just say something like that?
__Sheldon No, no, no, no, no, no, no…
__Penny How else was I supposed to say it?
__Leonard Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don't just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.
__Sheldon The horror!
__Penny Sheldon, I'm sure it's going to be fine.
__Sheldon No, it's not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it's not.
__Penny Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?
__Sheldon I never met them. That's what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.
__Penny Well, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.
__Sheldon You can't know that. How can you possibly know that?
__Penny You're right, I can't. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.
__Leonard Why are you making it worse?
__Penny I tried making it better, he wouldn't go for it.
__Howard You're right, that's a great idea.
__Howard I'll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.
__Penny The horror!
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard I'm sorry, that really is how it works.
__Sheldon You're tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?
__Leonard Raj, help me out here.
__Raj You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
__Sheldon I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?
__Howard Enough with the guilt, ma, we'll still see each other. I'll come over every night and have dinner with you.
__Howard's Mother Howard' The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?
__Howard Okay, I get it, you're angry. You don't want to see your little bird leave the nest.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Little bird? You're almost 30, fly, for god's sake!
__Howard Fine, I'll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you're ruining my life!
__Leonard Hey, Penny, it's Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.
__Sheldon I guess I won't be needing this.
__Leonard Stay calm, we don't know anything about them yet. What are you doing?
__Sheldon I'm checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
__Leonard The box says kitchen.
__Sheldon So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
__Blonde girl Hello?
__Leonard Hello.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Blonde Girl Hello.
__Leonard Hello.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Blonde Girl I'm Alicia. I'm moving in upstairs.
__Leonard That is so great. Oh, I'm Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.
__Alicia That's nice.
__Sheldon If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.
__Alicia Hello.
__Sheldon Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
__Alicia Freakishly feline?
__Sheldon Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We'll come back to that one.
__Leonard Sheldon…
__Alicia No.
__Leonard You're making her uncomfortable.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you're doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?
__Alicia What?!
__Sheldon I'm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
__Alicia I have no immediate plans.
__Sheldon If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?
__Alicia Pro?
__Sheldon Alicia?
__Alicia Yes?
__Sheldon Welcome to the building.
__Leonard Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
__Penny Oh, hey, guys.
__Leonard Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.
__Penny Hi.
__Alicia Hi.
__Leonard I'm helping.
__Penny I can see.
__Sheldon Alicia's non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She's still on probation, of course, but I like her.
__Alicia Cool t-shirt.
__Penny Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this. I'm going jogging.
__Sheldon You don't jog.
__Penny I can start.
__Sheldon True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you're out of clean clothes again.
__Penny Thank you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You're welcome, Penny.
__Alicia Please, you look cute. I'm dressed like a slob today, too.
__Leonard I think you look fantastic.
__Alicia This one's a player, huh?
__Penny Oh, yeah, be careful.
__Alicia Thanks for the warning.
__Penny Okay.
__Alicia I'll see you around.
__Penny See ya. I'm dressed like a slob today, too.
__Sheldon Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I've been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It's a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It's a trap. It's a trap. It's a trap.”
__Penny Hey.
__Sheldon Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.
__Penny Well, sort of.
__Sheldon How does one sort of…
__Penny I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?
__Sheldon He's upstairs at Alicia's.
__Penny Oh. all right, that's cool, no biggie. He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?
__Sheldon In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.
__Penny Oh, they're all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.
__Sheldon It's axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.
__Penny Okay, now I see the giant squid head.
__Sheldon Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again.
__Alicia Cool. so are you in a loft now?
__Howard Oh, actually I'm, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she's also my maid.
__Alicia Sounds like a sweet deal.
__Howard I won't lie, it's pretty dope.
__Penny Hello?
__Alicia Oh, hey.
__Penny Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.
__Alicia That is so sweet. Come on in, let's open it.
__Penny Great.
__Alicia Nice dress.
__Penny Oh, this? I'm dressed like a slob today.
__Alicia The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I've never had such good-looking technical support.
__Howard Oh, pish-posh.  I don't know, it means shucks.  Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.
__Leonard Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Alicia is an actress, just like you.
__Penny That is so awesome.
__Alicia Well, trying to be, but it's so hard.
__Penny Yeah, I know, tell me about it.
__Alicia I've been out here three months, and all I've gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.
__Penny That's why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I'm holding out for the right part.
__Leonard Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?
__Alicia Whatever you think is best, cutie.
__Leonard Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay.
__Penny Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won't get it, but it's right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing. The man says, “well, I'm a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don't you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”
__Leonard It's a little insulting, don't you think?
__Penny How would I know? I'm not even sure I get it.
__Alicia Hey, Leonard? If you're done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?
__Leonard Uh, yeah, I'd love to.
__Penny Uh, hey, maybe when you're done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.
__Leonard Yeah, I'll get to it, don't nag me.
__Raj Hello there
__Penny Well, they're all still up there.
__Sheldon You think I can't hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That's Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.
__Penny I don't even know why I care. I don't care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that's all I care.
__Sheldon You know, Penny, there's something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.
__Penny What are you saying, that I'm threatened by Alicia? That I'm like the old queen of the hive and it's just time for me to go?
__Sheldon I'm just talking about bees. They're on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
__Penny Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.
__Howard Yeah, what's the occasion?
__Penny No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.
__Sheldon Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Brown rice, not white?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
__Penny Yes
__Sheldon Good. See how it's done, Leonard?
__Penny So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?
__Leonard You want to watch Battlestar?
__Penny What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.
__Howard No, no, PMS is different.
__ Oh, thank God you're home. I need help.
__Alicia I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.
__Leonard Oh, I'd watch that.
__Leonard Okay, well, I'll take you.
__Alicia Oh, you're a lifesaver.
__Howard I'll run lines with you in the car.
__Alicia Great. And afterward, I'll take you all out for Chinese.
__Penny Oh, actually, that's okay. we already have…
__Howard Yum. Starving.
__Penny …chinese food right here.
__Sheldon They're gone, Penny. They can't hear you.
__Penny I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle's house in Orange County to pick up her TV?
__Sheldon You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
__Penny Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I'm telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.
__Sheldon May I interject something here?
__Penny Please.
__Sheldon You got the wrong mustard.
__Alicia Guess what? I got the part on CSI.
__Penny Oh boy.
__Alicia Something wrong?
__Penny Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you'll make a great hooker.
__Alicia Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?
__Penny Um, I don't know, I don't think a lot.
__Alicia Yeah, that's what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!
__Penny Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?
__Alicia About what?
__Penny Well, you know, it's just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren't like other guys. They're special.
__Alicia Okay, they're special, and?
__Penny Oh, let's see, how can I explain this, um, they don't know how to use their shields.
__Alicia Shields?
__Penny Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you're in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don't take advantage of them.
__Alicia Who says I'm taking advantage of them?
__Penny Come on, they're doing everything for you, because you're leading them on.
__Alicia So I let them do stuff for me. They're happy. I get stuff. Who cares? And how's it any different from what you do?
__Penny Excuse me?
__Alicia I've seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don't do the exact same thing?
__Alicia Oh, I'm out of line?
__Penny Yeah, you're out of line.
__Alicia Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?
__Sheldon Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
__Leonard Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
__Raj Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?
__Howard Oh, my God! Girl fight!
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Howard I know you. you're stupid enough to break it up.
__Penny Thank you.
__Howard You're right, this filly's been broken.
__Sheldon You set it on DTS, didn't you?
__Leonard I had to, she called me cutie.
__Howard According to Alicia's facebook page, she's hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.
__Penny Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.
__Sheldon Oh, great now she's jumping up and down on the bed.
__Leonard Problem?
__Sheldon This is Thai food.
__Howard Here we go.
__Sheldon We don't have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
__Leonard Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
__Sheldon Well apparently the news didn't reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.
__Howard Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we've been in lately.
__Sheldon Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we're going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let's call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.
__Raj I could go for some goat.
__Leonard Sheldon, we agreed we'd do something different tonight.
__Sheldon All right. Let's go to the comic book store.
__Raj We went to the comic book store last night.
__Sheldon Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we'll be going on Thursday, because it's Anything Can Happen Thursday.
__Leonard Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.
__Howard If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies' Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.
__Leonard Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.
__Howard Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
__Sheldon The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?
__Howard Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.
__Howard Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.
__Leonard You're joking.
__Howard I'm a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.
__Raj Well, what are we waiting for? Let's bounce, bitches.
__Leonard You're right. It's Anything Can Happen Thursday, let's hit the clubs and meet hot women!
__Raj Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We're going to hit it and quit it.
__Leonard Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
__Raj Also a good plan.
__Howard Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we're definitely going to a bar.
__Leonard Oh, absolutely.
__Raj You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies? We're eventually coming for you!
__Sheldon Fascinating.
__ Credits sequence.
__ Oh hey, guys, where're you headed?
__Sheldon To the comic book store. You're probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I've fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.
__Penny You got me. While you're there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?
__Sheldon I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
__Penny Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?
__Leonard Sure. What does he like?
__Penny I don't know, he's 13. Just pick out anything.
__Sheldon Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.
__Penny Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
__Sheldon Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?
__Penny Leonard?
__Leonard You know this can go on all night, why don't you just come with us?
__Penny Ugh, that's what I was trying to avoid.
__Sheldon Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.
__Leonard Don't worry, they're more scared of you than you are of them.
__Penny Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?
__Sheldon A superb choice.
__Penny Oh, great.
__Sheldon Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.
__Penny What's a multiverse?
__Sheldon Get her out of here.
__Leonard Come on, I'll help you pick something.
__Raj That's right. She's with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
__Howard Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.
__Store clerk Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?
__Leonard Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She's looking for some comic books.
__Stuart Oh, really. Blink twice if you're here against your will.
__Leonard I think we're fine, Stuart.
__Stuart Let me know if you need anything.
__Penny Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
__Leonard You mean for someone who's into comic books?
__Penny No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.
__Penny What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
__Leonard Ah, yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants. He doesn't really help the point I'm trying to make.
__ (Howard and Sheldon are looking through a rack of comic books. Each says “Got it” in turn as they look past each book until they eventually reach the one in the middle when they both together grab the book and shout “Need it!”)
__ Let it go, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
__Howard Yes, but I saw it from the front.
__Sheldon A far less impressive feat.
__Howard Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.
__Sheldon I need it for my Robin collection.
__Howard Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
__Sheldon Why would I gamble? It's mine. Let go.
__Howard You let go.
__Sheldon No, you!
__Leonard Problem?
__Sheldon Yes, he won't let go of my comic book.
__Leonard Uh, cut it in half?
__Penny Excuse me.
__Stuart Hello again.
__Penny Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
__Stuart A 13-year-old girl. But if you're dead set on a comic book, try this.
__Penny Oh, Hellblazer. What's this about?
__Stuart A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.
__Penny Well, if that doesn't make me the favourite aunt, I don't know what will. Is this me?
__Stuart Depends. Do you like it?
__Penny It's really good.
__Stuart Yes, that's you.
__Stuart It'd still be you, but I'd feel like an idiot.
__Leonard I don't believe it. Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.
__Howard I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
__Sheldon Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.
__Raj Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny's business over there?
__Leonard Nobody's up in anybody's business, let's just buy our stuff and go.
__Penny Okay, you've got my number, now, give me the picture.
__Stuart You drive a hard bargain, but here.
__Penny All right. So, um, just give me a call.
__Sheldon So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?
__Leonard Apparently so.
__Sheldon Are you ill?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon All right. Then is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
__Leonard When did you pick up on that?
__Sheldon A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?
__Leonard Sure, why not?
__Sheldon Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.
__Leonard Gee, thanks a lot.
__Sheldon Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
__Leonard I don't need any insights. I just want to know why Penny's more interested in Stuart than me. We're practically the same guy.
__Sheldon Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.
__Leonard You're right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.
__Sheldon My original point.
__Howard Who's up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
__Penny Oh, hey guys.
__Leonard Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.
__Stuart Hey, guys.
__Howard So what are you kids up to?
__Penny Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that's opening tonight.
__Leonard And you guys are going together, great…
__Stuart It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?
__Penny It's Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?
__Sheldon Vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It's the buggy beta version.
__Penny Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.
__Stuart Yeah, see you guys.
__Howard See you, Stuart.
__Howard Yes.
__Leonard Take me to a bar with women.
__Howard Really?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Howard Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
__Leonard Why?
__Howard Well, if I get lucky, I don't want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.
__Howard No, he may not.
__Howard I'm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
__Raj Fine. I'll have a chocolate martini.
__Howard Wrong again!
__Raj Come on, you know I can't talk to women unless I'm lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.
__Howard Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn't have to because there are no women in them.
__Raj Gotcha. I'll have a Brandy Alexander.
__Howard All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.
__Leonard Should we talk to some of these women?
__Howard It's way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.
__Leonard That's your system?
__Howard That's my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she's mine.
__Stuart Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese.
__Penny Um, you know, it's kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?
__Stuart Oh, gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?
__Penny Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.
__Sheldon Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?
__Stuart Uh, yeah, I guess.
__Penny Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so…
__Sheldon What are you doing?
__Stuart We're having coffee.
__Sheldon Isn't it a little late for coffee?
__Penny I'll just go look for it.
__Stuart What's up?
__Sheldon Well, I've spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.
__Stuart Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What's the topic?
__Sheldon I am asserting, in the event that Batman's death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.
__Stuart Ooh, Sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.
__Sheldon More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
__Stuart Of course it is. It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.
__Sheldon Has to be? Has to be? I hope you're being deliberately provocative.
__Penny I found the decaf!
__Stuart Oh, great!
__Sheldon Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.
__Leonard How about those two?
__Howard Nah, they're eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.
__Leonard What about the ones in the corner?
__Howard Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?
__Leonard I think Blinky's cute.
__Howard You got it, sir.
__Leonard Wait, so we just go over there?
__Howard No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend's had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they're laughing, we're laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we're millionaires.
__Leonard What else you got?
__Howard Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
__Leonard No.
__Howard I can't sit on your lap, you don't know the routine.
__Sheldon Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman's parents effectively deprived him of his raison d'être.
__Stuart Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn't make you right.
__Sheldon Au contraire.
__Stuart Plus, you're forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.
__Sheldon I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
__Stuart Okay, look, Sheldon, it's late and I've got to get some sleep.
__Sheldon So, I win.
__Stuart No, I'm tired.
__Sheldon So, I win.
__Stuart Fine. You win.
__Sheldon Darn tootin', I win.
__Stuart Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?
__Sheldon No, no, no, no, don't wake her. She'll maul you like a rabid wolverine.
__Stuart You know, I don't think that was decaf.
__Leonard I thought you were good at this. You're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
__Howard I do, all the time.
__Leonard Well, what happened? We've been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called.
__Howard Wow, you're just going to make me come out and say it, aren't you?
__Leonard Say what?
__Howard You're weighing me down. I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.
__Leonard Fine. I'll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
__Howard Don't be ridiculous, you can't just tell a falcon when to hunt.
__Leonard Actually, you can. There's a whole sport built around it. Falconry.
__Howard Shut up. Let's just get Koothrappali and go. (They turn to see Raj with his tongue down the throat of a “larger lady” by the bar.) Lucky bastard. It's got to be that stupid accent of his.  Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I'm stumped.
__Leonard Yes
__Howard Were you in the original trilogy?
__Leonard Yes
__Howard Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
__Leonard God, I hope not. And no, I'm not Princess Leia.
__Raj Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?
__Leonard Yes
__Raj Interesting. Are you a Droid?
__Leonard Yes
__Raj Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
__Leonard Yes
__Raj C3PO.
__Leonard You got it.
__Howard Leslie Winkle. You've reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.
__Sheldon What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?
__Leonard No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, I can't imagine any of that.
__Leonard Alright, back to the game.
__Sheldon I believe it's my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you're ready.
__Raj Are you Spock?
__Sheldon I don't like this game.
__Howard So, where were we?
__Raj Aren't you leaving for your booty call?
__Howard No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who's turn is it?
__Leonard We were up to you.
__Howard Great, just start.
__Leonard Okay, let's see. Are you from a TV series?
__Howard She dumped me!
__Sheldon I bet he's someone from Babylon 5, we're never going to guess.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard I don't know. She just said Howard, momma's a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.
__Sheldon I don't understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?
__Leonard Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.
__Howard Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God's sake!
__Leonard Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?
__Howard I don't want to go anywhere.
__Sheldon You know, I'm given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.
__Raj Is it me, or was that Sheldon's way of saying Vegas baby!
__Leonard I've never been there, have you?
__Raj Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
__Howard It could be fun. I know my weekend's wide open, now that…
__Leonard Okay, then let's do this, lets go to Las Vegas.
__Howard Now? Right now?
__Leonard Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can't we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we'll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we'll go right now.
__Raj What do you say, Howard?
__Howard I say Vegas baby!
__Howard Sea World, baby!
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?
__Sheldon I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
__Leonard Great, we'll bring you back a tee-shirt.
__Penny Hello, Sheldon.
__Sheldon And how are you doing this fine evening?
__Penny Great.
__Sheldon Good. I'm glad.
__Penny Really? Are you drunk?
__Sheldon I'm just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.
__Penny That's Superman's big ice thing, right?
__Sheldon Do you know, I'm such a good mood, I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.
__Penny Mmm, what smells so good?
__Sheldon That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it's main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer's cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.
__Penny Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.
__Sheldon Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.
__Penny Have fun, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, I shall.  No!
__Penny What's wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?
__Leonard Howard, could I borrow some after shave?
__Howard Black case, top compartment.
__Leonard That is a lot of cologne.
__Raj That's the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can.
__Leonard Come on, let's go.
__Howard You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.
__Howard Okay, fine, I'm checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she's saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.
__Raj But she did dump you.
__Howard Grow up, Raj,there's no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I'll catch up with you.
__Leonard Alright.
__Raj Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.
__Leonard Okay, uh, if I get lucky I'll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I'll sleep on the moon.
__Raj Sounds like a plan.
__Sheldon We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.
__Penny So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.
__Sheldon I left them in the bowl.
__Penny Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
__Sheldon Where?
__Penny In your apartment.
__Sheldon What's it doing in my apartment?
__Penny Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren't home, and I forgot it there.
__Sheldon You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
__Penny It's not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.
__Sheldon You're the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.
__Penny Alright, Sheldon, let's just calm down and we'll call the building manager, he'll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you're waiting.
__Sheldon Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
__Penny Yeah, why not?
__Sheldon Sure, why not? And after the sun's down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today's the day to stop making sense.
__Raj I'm telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.
__Leonard Dude, check it out. That's laundry for a month!
__Woman Hi.
__Raj Hello.
__Woman What's your name?
__Woman Hello Rajesh Ram… Hi, Rajesh, I'm Michaela.
__Raj Hello, Michaela.
__Michaela So, are you interested a little party?
__Raj Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren't Ramayan.
__Leonard Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.
__Raj Not now, Leonard, Michaela's inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.
__Leonard Yeah, I really need to talk to you.
__Raj Excuse me, I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. Don't move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  What's wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.
__Leonard Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I'm pretty sure she is a prostitute.
__Raj What? No. ..
__Leonard Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.
__Raj Maybe I can save her.
__Leonard Maybe, but I'm guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.
__Raj It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours.
__Michaela Whatever.
__Raj Oh, I miss her already.
__Leonard Oh, Howard's losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I'm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”
__Raj Why don't we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
__Leonard You think that'd help?
__Raj USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
__Leonard I don't know, Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy.
__Raj It's too bad he wasn't here for that hooker. She's exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.
__Leonard We're not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
__Raj Raj (reading Howard's twitter): “I'm so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”
__Leonard Suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate.
__Penny Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don't have to.
__Sheldon No, it's the accepted convention. How was your day?
__Penny Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…
__Sheldon I'm sorry, that's not going to interest me at all, just eat.
__Michaela Oh, hi.
__Leonard Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you're not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…
__Raj If you're really a prostitute.
__Michaela You guys cops?
__Together No.
__Michaela I am a prostitute.
__Leonard Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we've got this friend, and he's kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.
__Raj With sex.
__Leonard I think she knows what I meant.
__Raj How can she when you beat around the bush. She's from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
__Michaela Don't worry, I can take good care of your friend.
__Leonard Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn't know that you're a… you know…
__Raj Prostitute.
__Michaela You want the girlfriend experience.
__Leonard Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.
__Raj Uh, actually, if it's not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.
__Penny Oh, God, I don't know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?
__Sheldon How can one person be a whole movie?
__Sheldon Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
__Penny What?
__Penny Where did that even come from, did he say we were?
__Sheldon No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.
__Penny No, just mail, no benefits.
__Sheldon Hmm, I see.
__Penny Why are you asking?
__Sheldon I'm curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I've observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.
__Penny Well, some people just can't handle that kind of relationship.
__Sheldon Can you?
__Penny Excuse me?
__Sheldon Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
__Penny Sheldon, I really don't want to talk about this with you.
__Sheldon Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
__Penny Of course it's making me uncomfortable, can't you tell?
__Sheldon I really have no idea. I don't particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…
__Penny I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!
__Sheldon Thank you, that's very helpful.
__Leonard Behold?
__Howard Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby's arm?
__Raj A little baby.
__Howard I'm going back to the room.
__Michaela Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?
__Howard Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.
__Michaela Esther Rosenblatt.
__Sheldon Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
__Penny Well, it wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind, but it's the one I'm going with.
__Sheldon I can't sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it's dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering's beloved children's book , The Tall Man From Cornwall.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there's no room for my big Cornish head.
__Penny Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.
__Sheldon May I say one last thing.
__Penny Only if it doesn't rhyme.
__Sheldon Alright. Goodnight.
__Howard Really, me too.
__Michaela Oy gevalt, you're hot.
__Howard Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.
__Leonard Hey, how's it going.
__Howard Cut the crap, you set this up, didn't you?
__Howard She's a hooker, isn't she.
__Raj A prostitute, yes.
__Howard You already gave her the money?
__Leonard Yes.
__Howard Thank you!
__Penny What?
__Sheldon I can't sleep. how are you going?
__Penny Maybe that's because your hole is still open.
__Sheldon I'm homesick.
__Penny Your home is twenty feet from here.
__Sheldon Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn't matter. It's in a galaxy far, far away.
__Penny Damn it. What do you want me to do
__Sheldon Sing soft kitty.
__Penny That's only for when you're sick.
__Sheldon Homesick is a type of being sick.
__Penny Come on, do I really have to?
__Sheldon I suppose we can stay up and talk.
__Penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um…
__Sheldon Sleepy kitty.
__Penny Sleepy ki…
__Sheldon No. Start over.
__Penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
__Sheldon Penny.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Thank you for letting me stay here.
__Penny Oh, you're welcome sweetie.
__Sheldon Okay, I'm sleepy now, get out.
__Leonard What were you doing at Penny's?
__Sheldon Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you'll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits.
__Howard They're on me today, boys.
__Raj You're paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
__Howard No, I'm celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
__Raj Oh, get over yourself, it's a high-tech toilet.
__Leonard Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
__ where no man has gone before.
__ Is that supposed to be funny?
__Sheldon I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
__Howard Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
__Raj He's right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.
__Sheldon Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
__Stuart Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It's mind-blowing.
__Sheldon Excuse me, spoiler alert.
__Stuart I didn't spoil anything.
__Sheldon You told me it's mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
__Stuart I'm sorry.
__Sheldon Said the Grinch to Christmas.
__Stuart Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?
__Leonard Oh, sure, what's up?
__Stuart Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?
__Leonard Yeah, vaguely.
__Raj Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
__Leonard What about it?
__Stuart Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn't go that well.
__Leonard Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
__Stuart I can't do that.
__Leonard Why the hell not?
__Stuart ‘Cause we're going out again tomorrow.
__Sheldon Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?
__Stuart No.
__Sheldon Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.
__Stuart Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don't want to screw it up.
__Stuart So, here's my question. It's the second date, you think she'll be expecting things to get physical?
__Leonard Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?
__Stuart Okay, so, you'll give me a call?
__Leonard Yeah, or you call me.
__Stuart Great.
__Leonard Or nobody calls anyone.
__Raj Interesting. Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
__Leonard You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
__Howard Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
__Leonard I'm listening.
__Howard Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Oh, hi.
__Penny How's it going?
__Leonard Good, good. You?
__Penny Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?
__Leonard Sure.
__Penny You know your friend Stuart?
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
__Leonard About what?
__Penny Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…
__Leonard No, no that's the past. I'm really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause, well, that's my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
__Penny Okay, well, that's really cool of you.
__Leonard Yeah, well I wouldn't say cool, I'd just say, that's Leonard!
__Penny Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
__Leonard About Stuart? Love to.
__Leonard Well, uh, first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.
__Penny Really?
__Leonard Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that's why he works in a comic book store.
__Sheldon You're not going to answer it?
__Leonard He wants to talk about Penny. I don't want to talk about Penny.
__Sheldon You're making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.
__Leonard Why would he call me?
__Sheldon We don't know. And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.
__Leonard I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Answer the phone, Leonard.
__Leonard No! There, it went to voice mail.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
__Leonard It must be hell inside your head.
__Sheldon At times.
__Howard Guys, we have a code red.
__Sheldon Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
__Howard Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
__Leonard How teeny tiny?
__Sheldon But the mission is for six months.
__Howard Yeah, see, that's the code red. It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
__Sheldon Have you notified NASA?
__Howard No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there's gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
__Leonard Well, what are you gonna do?
__Howard I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.
__Leonard So, what do you need us for?
__Raj He can't figure out how to fix it.
__Howard Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.
__Raj I'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
__Sheldon I agree. It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
__Raj Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
__Leonard Good one.
__Raj Yeah.
__Howard Yeah, ha, it's hilarious. Now, here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
__Raj You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?
__Sheldon Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
__Stuart Hey Leonard.
__Leonard Hey Stuart.
__Stuart You busy?
__Leonard Um…
__Howard Classified, Leonard.
__Leonard Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project. What's up?
__Stuart Well, tonight's my date with Penny and since we haven't been able to connect by phone…
__Stuart Or e-mail.
__Leonard Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.
__Stuart Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
__Leonard All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.
__Stuart Okay.
__Leonard You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don't make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.
__Stuart Fear?
__Leonard Yeah, like, you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.
__Stuart Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
__Leonard Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.
__Stuart Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?
__Howard You don't know what this is?
__Stuart No.
__Howard Good. Get out.
__Raj Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.
__Leonard It wasn't bad advice. It just wasn't particularly helpful.
__Sheldon For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
__Howard No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
__Leonard I feel terrible.
__Howard Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.
__Raj Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.
__Sheldon You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?
__Raj It's not superstition. It's practically Newtonian. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It's actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.
__Howard Speaking of what goes around comes around…
__Raj Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
__Sheldon It won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
__Raj What if we reposition the collection tank?
__Sheldon It won't work. No way to mount it.
__Howard Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?
__Sheldon That could work.
__Penny Morning. What's up?
__Penny Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.
__Leonard Great. So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
__Penny I really don't want to talk about it.
__Leonard Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…
__Penny I said I don't want to talk about it.
__Leonard Okay… I just… I kind of…
__Penny Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?
__Raj If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.
__Sheldon You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.
__Howard Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
__Sheldon If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
__Raj Howard, wait. Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
__Howard Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
__Raj That what that's for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
__Howard Where are you going?
__Leonard Comic book store.
__Sheldon Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.
__Raj Me, too.
__Howard Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
__Sheldon Why does Leonard get to go?
__Leonard ‘Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.
__Leonard Thanks for understanding, Howard.
__Howard I got your back, sister. All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.
__Raj Wow, that's heavy.
__Howard Damn right it's heavy, it's my mother's meat loaf, it's been testing toilets for generations.
__Sheldon I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.
__Howard Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one.
__Sheldon Fascinating.
__Raj What do you think the problem is?
__Howard Not enough bread crumbs.
__Stuart Sure, what's up?
__Stuart No, your advice was great.
__Leonard It was?
__Stuart Yeah, going slow really worked.
__Leonard You're kidding. Never worked for me.
__Stuart Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
__Leonard Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.
__Stuart It doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell.
__Leonard During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.
__Stuart No, everything was good and really hot, and I said “Oh, Penny,” and right where she was supposed to say, “Oh, Stuart,” she said… your name.
__Leonard Leonard?
__Stuart That is your name, right?
__Leonard Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I'm sorry. That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
__Stuart Well, it beats you know I'm a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.
__Leonard No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
__Stuart Not your fault.
__Leonard Yeah, how about that? See you soon.
__Stuart Yeah, sure.
__Leonard Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.
__Howard Well, they've deployed our solution. Let's just all hope it works.
__Sheldon I don't see why I have to worry. My career's not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It's funny, because it's true.
__Penny Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
__Leonard I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
__Penny Yeah, I said Leonard.
__Leonard Yes, you did, didn't you?
__Penny What the hell is that?
__Howard Meatloaf.
__Leonard What was it doing on the ceiling?
__Howard That's classified.
__Houston ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
__ISS voice Houston, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes.
__Houston ISS, I'm afraid we can't authorize that.
__ISS voice Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I can't comment without violating our agreement that I don't criticize your work.
__Leonard Then what was oh, boy?
__Sheldon Great restraint on my part.
__Leonard There's nothing wrong with the science here.
__Sheldon Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
__Leonard Okay, how's that?
__Sheldon You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you've fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here's a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
__Leonard Why?
__Leonard Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning.
__Leonard Yeah, I know the feeling.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Sheldon, it's two o'clock in the morning.
__Leonard Everybody?
__Sheldon You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.
__Leonard You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night?
__Sheldon He didn't respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.
__Leonard You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I'm talking to.
__Sheldon Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
__Leonard Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.
__Sheldon Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.
__Leonard Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
__Sheldon Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”
__Leonard Okay, well, do you want to go?
__Sheldon Of course not. I'm a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it's indoors, but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.
__Leonard Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.
__Sheldon Sarcasm?
__Leonard Maybe.
__Sheldon I'm on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?
__Leonard Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.
__Sheldon I'm not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can't go.
__Leonard Well, then don't go.
__Sheldon How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don't go.
__Leonard All right, then go.
__Sheldon Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
__Leonard Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
__Sheldon Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.
__Leonard How was it resolved?
__Sheldon It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
__Howard We could sit on the left side of the couch.
__Leonard I could use the bathroom at 8:20.
__Raj Our dreams are very small, aren't they?
__Sheldon Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…
__All Yeah! Woo-hoo!
__Sheldon …the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
__Leonard It's not gonna be the same without you.
__Howard Godspeed.
__Sheldon Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.
__Raj Ooh, I don't like where this is going.
__Sheldon I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
__Howard To the North Pole?
__Raj Is this just so we won't touch your stuff while you're away?
__Sheldon I'll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I'll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.
__Howard Really?
__Sheldon Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I'm proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don't you take a few moments to discuss it?
__Howard We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
__Sheldon I'm still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.
__Howard We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
__Leonard Hang on. Let's talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don't know how we can turn it down.
__Howard Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don't want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don't want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.”
__Raj But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.
__Leonard Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.
__Howard I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.
__Raj You still might get on a magazine.
__Howard So you guys are seriously considering this?
__Leonard Yes.
__Howard And you think you can put up with Sheldon?
__Raj Well, I'm a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!
__Sheldon Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?
__Leonard I'm in.
__Raj Me, too.
__Howard Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.
__Sheldon Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition's team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don't worry, there will be a briefing.
__Penny Sheldon.
__ Penny.
__Penny Sheldon.
__ Penny.
__Penny Sheldon.
__ Penny.
__Penny Sheldon.
__ Penny.
__Penny Sheldon.
__ Penny.
__ Penny.
__Penny What do you want?
__Sheldon I need access to the Cheesecake Factory's walk-in freezer.
__Penny Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon I don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.
__Penny You're all going?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny For three months?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Excuse me.
__Sheldon Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
__Penny Hey, Leonard.
__Leonard Hi.
__Penny Sheldon says you're going to the North Pole.
__Leonard Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?
__Penny Yeah. I'm just a little surprised you didn't tell me.
__Leonard Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
__Penny Oh, hey, no, you don't have to apologize. There's no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.
__Sheldon Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?
__Penny Is he serious?
__Leonard Actually, it would help.
__Penny All right, I'll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?
__Penny Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.
__Leonard Did she seem upset to you?
__Sheldon No. Did she seem upset to you?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?
__Leonard A little bit.
__Sheldon Two for two. I'm on fire.
__Leonard I mean, I know she's not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?
__Sheldon That feels like a bonus question. I'm going to stop here while I'm ahead, but I've had a great time.
__Raj Where are your tools?
__Sheldon Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we'll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I'm “ridiculous,” I've provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children's game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.
__Howard For this I went to MIT.
__Sheldon And begin.
__Raj I think I swallowed some paint!
__Sheldon Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
__Howard Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.
__Leonard Okay, I can't do this.
__Raj Me either.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.
__Howard You heard the man. Hold him down and I'll cut him open.
__Leonard Hang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
__Sheldon I hadn't thought of that. I guess we're done here.
__Leonard What is it?
__Sheldon It's hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
__Howard Okay, why?
__Sheldon Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.
__Leonard Sheldon, you know I can't eat butter. I'm lactose intolerant.
__Sheldon Way ahead of you, that's an “I Can't Believe It's Not Butter” stick.
__Raj But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.
__Mrs Koothrappali I don't care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?
__Raj If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.
__Dr Koothrappali Don't talk back to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.
__Raj No, it's not. Howard, tell them.
__Howard Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it'll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.
__Mrs Koothrappali So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?
__Sheldon That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.
__Howard Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone with Raj's parents. Can you tell them that you're okay with me going to the Arctic?
__Howard's Mother Howard' Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!
__Howard I didn't say that. You never listen to me!
__Howard's Mother Howard' He doesn't tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he's ashamed!
__Penny Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?
__Leonard Sure, but let's go out here where there's a little less yelling and guilt. What's up?
__Penny Well, I got you a little going away present.
__Leonard Oh, a blanket.
__Penny Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.
__Leonard Oh, wow, cool.
__Penny Oh, I'm gonna miss you.  See you later.
__Leonard Bye.
__Mrs Koothrappali I told you no. Why don't you believe me?
__Howard's Mother Howard' ‘Cause it doesn't make sense to me! How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?!
__Sheldon I want a cookie, Meemaw.
__Leonard Sheldon, it's me.
__Sheldon But Meemaw just made cookies.
__Leonard Listen, I don't know if I can go on the expedition.
__Sheldon What?
__Leonard I don't think I can go to the North Pole.
__Sheldon Comforting is a part of leadership. It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden.
__Leonard Terrific, it's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go.
__Sheldon Assuming that's a valid reason not to go, which it isn't, how do you know this? Did she say it?
__Leonard Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
__Sheldon What is it?
__Leonard It's a blanket with sleeves.
__Sheldon Oh, that's clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?
__Leonard Yes, obviously.
__Sheldon All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.
__Leonard Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?
__Sheldon She does have a short attention span.
__Leonard So, I can't go.
__Sheldon Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.
__Leonard You really think so?
__Sheldon Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I've managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!
__Leonard It's 7 a.m. I'm sorry it's early, but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard What did you mean when you said you're going to miss me?
__Penny Um, I don't know. You'll be gone and I'll notice.
__Leonard Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?
__Penny Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.
__Penny That wasn't a long hug.
__Leonard It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
__Penny Leonard, I don't know what to tell you. It was just a hug.
__Leonard Glad we cleared that up.
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard I guess I'll see you.
__Penny Okay, have a safe trip.
__Leonard Thank you. Bye.
__Penny Okay, bye.  Means I wish you weren't going.
__Howard What?
__Leonard We're out of ice.
__Sheldon All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.
__Raj What are you working on?
__Howard Crossbow.
__Leonard Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.
__Raj He's right.
__Howard Yeah, wow.
__Sheldon It is remarkable.
__Raj So, who's up for a movie?
__Howard Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter's The Thing?
__Raj I say double feature.
__Leonard Dinner's ready!
__Sheldon What are we having?
__Leonard Reconstituted Thai food.
__Sheldon Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
__Leonard Check.
__Sheldon Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
__Leonard Check.
__Sheldon Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?
__Leonard Uh, oh, sorry.
__Sheldon Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You're in my spot.
__Howard There's no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
__Sheldon Three months. This is gonna be great!
__Howard I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
__Raj It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
__Sheldon I don't know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.
__Leonard I'm going to go let Penny know we're back.
__Sheldon Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye.  Hello, old friend.  Daddy's home.
__Leonard Yeah, I just stopped by to say…  Yeah, so, hi!
__Penny Hi!
__Howard Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.
__Raj Yeah, it was first come, first served.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Great.
__Raj Thanks.
__Sheldon Of course, I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.
__Raj We have to tell him.
__Sheldon Tell me what?
__Howard Damn his Vulcan hearing.
__Sheldon You fellows are planning a party for me, aren't you?
__Howard Okay, Sheldon, sit down.
__Sheldon If there's going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don't care for luau, toga or under the sea.
__Howard Yeah, we'll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.
__Sheldon If this is about the night the heat went out, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
__Raj It's not about that.
__Howard And we agreed to never speak of it again.
__Sheldon So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
__Howard He's speaking about it.
__Raj For me, it was a bonding moment.
__Howard Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?
__Raj I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
__Howard That's why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.
__Sheldon Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.
__Howard Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.
__Raj He just went colon, capital O.
__Sheldon You tampered with my experiment?
__Howard We had to.
__Raj It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
__Sheldon Did Leonard know about this? Leonard's my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn't know.
__Howard Actually, it was his idea.
__Sheldon Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
__Leonard I missed you, too.
__Penny I couldn't even think of anyone else while you were gone.
__Leonard Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it's… don't ask.
__Sheldon Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.
__Leonard Do not make a sound.
__Sheldon Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
__Leonard Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
__Penny Oh, this is ridiculous. What?
__Sheldon Hello, Penny. I realize you're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?
__Penny It's great to see you too. Come on in.
__Sheldon Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
__Leonard Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don't expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.
__Penny Okay, can someone please tell me what's going on here?
__Sheldon What's going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
__Penny Is that true?
__Leonard It was the only way to make him happy.
__Penny Why did you have to make him happy?
__Leonard Because when he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
__Sheldon That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
__Leonard No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.
__Sheldon Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man's understanding of the universe.
__Sheldon You're right, Leonard, it's not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal
__Penny Oh, the poor thing.
__Leonard Yeah, I feel terrible.
__Penny Wait, wait. Aren't you going to go talk to him?
__Leonard What? Uh, he'll be fine, the guy's a trouper, come here.
__Penny No, you're right, you shouldn't talk to him. I will.
__Leonard Man, I cannot catch a break.
__Sheldon About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con!
__Penny Oh, hon… Uh…  Soft kitty, warm kitty…
__Sheldon That's for when I'm sick. Sad is not sick.
__Penny Oh. Sorry. I don't know your sad song.
__Sheldon I don't have a sad song. I'm not a child.
__Penny Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.
__Sheldon Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
__Penny Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol' slutbag.
__Sheldon Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
__Penny Well, they're pretty tasty.
__Sheldon And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?
__Penny Look, Sheldon, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it's like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true, like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?
__Sheldon I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
__Howard Thanks. I call it the Clooney.
__Raj I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how's Sheldon doing?
__Leonard Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I'd say, a little better.
__Howard If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally… you know.
__Leonard Howard…
__Howard Personally, I don't care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.
__Leonard Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.
__Howard He says they didn't do it.
__Leonard Sheldon, over here.
__Howard What are you doing?
__Raj I feel bad for the guy.
__Leonard Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?
__Sheldon Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.
__Leonard Come on. We said we were sorry.
__Sheldon It's going to take more than I'm sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you've done to me.
__Sheldon You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
__Kripke That's not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.
__Sheldon All right, I've had enough. Attention, everyone. I' m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.
__Kripke Off a cwiff.
__Sheldon My credibility may have been damaged…
__Kripke Compwetely wecked.
__Sheldon But I would like to remind you that in science, there's no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man's name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.
__Kripke Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein's cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you're still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.
__Sheldon Oh, you think you're so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.
__Leonard So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
__Raj Well, we'll always have the night the heat went out.
__Leonard Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn't have a chance to give you this.
__Penny Oh, Leonard, you shouldn't have. Oh, boy! What is it?
__Leonard It's a snowflake. From the North Pole.
__Leonard Uh-huh. It'll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
__Penny Oh, my God. That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me that I didn't understand.
__Howard Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.
__Leonard Man, I can not catch a break.
__Penny So, how do you know he ran away?
__Howard Well, he's not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I'm running away.
__Leonard Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.
__Penny Well, Leonard, aren't you going to do something?
__Leonard Of course I'm going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I'll stay here with Penny in her apartment.  Oh, damn it. It's Sheldon's mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you're right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I'll stay here with Penny in her apartment.
__Penny Well, you're not gonna go with them?
__Leonard Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh, come on, I don't want to go to Texas!
__Howard Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we're done.
__Leonard Trust me, you'll be fine. See ya.
__Penny Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He's your best friend.
__Leonard Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.
__Penny No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.
__Leonard Really?
__Penny Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
__Penny Go.
__Raj Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?
__Sheldon Thanks, Mom.
__Mrs Cooper Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.
__Sheldon Aw, Mom.
__Mrs Cooper This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all…
__Sheldon Fed.
__Mrs Cooper Give us, Lord, our daily…
__Sheldon Bread.
__Mrs Cooper Please know that we are truly…
__Sheldon Grateful.
__Mrs Cooper For every cup and every…
__Sheldon Plateful.
__Mrs Cooper Amen. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
__Sheldon My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
__Mrs Cooper Whatever. Jesus still loves you.
__Sheldon Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he's Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?
__Sheldon They're not my friends.
__Mrs Cooper All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.
__Sheldon That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that's why they hated me.
__Mrs Cooper Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you.
__Howard Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys' large they had.
__Raj I'm sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where's the tumbleweeds? Where's the saloons?
__Leonard Saloons?
__Raj Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.
__Howard This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
__Raj I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
__Leonard What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
__Howard No, I want to blend in.
__Raj To what? Toy Story?
__Mrs Cooper Hi, boys.
__Howard Howdy, ma'am.
__Mrs Cooper Howdy to you, too. You got here quick.
__Leonard – We took the red-eye.
__Mrs Cooper Well, come on in.
__Howard Thank you kindly.
__Mrs Cooper Can I… Can I get you something to drink?
__Leonard Uh, no, thank you.
__Howard If y'all don't mind, I got a hankerin' for a Lone Star beer.
__Mrs Cooper There's no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.
__Howard Sorry. I'll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.
__Mrs Cooper You'll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn't it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who's an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she'd be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.
__Leonard Uh, if you don't mind, Mrs. Cooper, there's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.
__Mrs Cooper A girl?
__Leonard Uh, yes, ma'am.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, good. I've been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.
__Sheldon What are they doing here?
__Leonard We came to apologize.
__Howard Again.
__Leonard And bring you home. So, why don't you pack up your stuff and we'll head back.
__Leonard No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.
__Mrs Cooper You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone's entitled to their opinion.
__Sheldon Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.
__Mrs Cooper And that is your opinion.
__Sheldon I forgive you. Let's go home.
__Mrs Cooper Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.
__Penny Uh-huh.
__Leonard You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
__Penny Sure.
__Penny I don't know.
__Leonard I mean, we were friends, and now we're more than friends. We're whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and…
__Penny Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah?
__Penny It's weird.
__Leonard Totally.
__Sheldon Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don't you think if I were wrong, I'd know it?
__Howard Okay, first of all…
__Raj Give it up, dude, you're arguing with a crazy person.
__Sheldon I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.
__Leonard Hey, guys.
__Howard What are you doing here?
__Leonard What do you mean? It's new comic book night.
__Raj Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
__Leonard There's more to life than sex, Raj.
__Howard Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?
__Sheldon I did.
__Leonard Nothing flamed out. We don't have to have sex every night, you know.
__Howard You don't have to, but it's highly recommended.
__Raj Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.
__Leonard It's not a matter of opportunity. We're getting to know each other. There's a learning curve.
__Howard What's there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.
__Sheldon Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
__Raj Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
__Sheldon Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.
__Leonard Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.
__Raj Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.
__Leonard I'm not saying it was bad, I'm just saying it… wasn't great.
__Howard Okay, when you say “it wasn't great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?
__Raj Oh, yeah.
__Leonard To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don't know…
__Raj Disappointed? Let down?
__Howard Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?
__Leonard All I know is, it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.
__Howard Sex is never the way I dream it's gonna be.
__Raj That's because in your dreams you're a horse from the waist down.
__ Credits Sequence
__Sheldon Tandoori Palace?
__Leonard No, we went somewhere new.
__Sheldon You're good-naturedly ribbing me, aren't you?
__Leonard No, look, Mumbai Palace.
__Leonard Trust me, this will be just fine.
__Howard You are the authority on just fine.
__Leonard What's that supposed to mean?
__Howard Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.
__Penny What are they talking about?
__Leonard I don't know
__Sheldon I know. As I'm sure you're aware…
__Leonard Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
__Sheldon If that's Morse code, that's terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you're seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
__Penny Okay, yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.
__Leonard Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
__Sheldon I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
__Raj Yeah, you…
__Howard Uh, no, no, no, don't tell him, let's see if he can figure it out.
__Penny Ugh, I am so embarrassed!
__Leonard Please don't be mad.
__Penny What did you tell them?
__Leonard Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.
__Penny Fine? You said it was fine?
__Penny It was… okay.
__Leonard Okay?
__Penny Yeah, it's a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let's not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other's rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.
__Leonard So, you've been through this before?
__Penny No.
__Leonard Okay-dokay.
__Penny You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?
__Leonard So much.
__Penny Okay. See, we should've done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.
__Leonard Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
__Penny Don't talk, just drink.
__Howard No, you're misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn't an actual goddess and we don't pray to them, we prey on them.
__Raj Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard's got one and you don't.
__Sheldon Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh, good! Now I can eat.
__Howard Sounds like a cricket.
__Sheldon Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.
__Howard Oh, give me a frickin' break. How could you possibly know that?
__Sheldon In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
__Raj How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
__Sheldon Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I've had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of '06.
__Howard Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you're wrong about the cricket.
__Sheldon Howard, don't embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.
__Howard No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.
__Raj Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
__Sheldon That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
__Howard Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that's an ordinary field cricket.
__Sheldon I can't take your money.
__Howard What's the matter, you chicken?
__Sheldon I've always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour's chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
__Raj Chickens can't climb trees
__Sheldon Thank God.
__Howard Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don't buy. Bet me.
__Sheldon Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
__Howard I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.
__Sheldon All right, you have a wager.
__Howard Hmm.
__Raj Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.
__ Slight time shift. The guys are searching for the cricket.
__ I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
__Penny Hit me.
__Howard Shh!
__Raj Hallway.
__Sheldon One at a time.  What was that?
__Raj My stomach. Indian food doesn't agree with me. Ironic, isn't it?
__Howard Shh! Elevator shaft.
__Sheldon Help me open it.
__Howard Are you crazy? We can't go down an empty elevator shaft.
__Sheldon Fine, if you don't want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
__Howard Let's open her up.
__Sheldon Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
__Howard Don't push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.
__Sheldon Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?
__Raj Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
__Penny Peppermint schnapps.
__Leonard Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
__Penny Because I like peppermint, and it's fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?
__Leonard What?
__Penny Schnapps.
__Leonard Schnapps. You're right, that is fun.
__Sheldon If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
__Raj Stairwell.
__Sheldon Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It's really dark down here.
__Leonard I'm okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I'm gonna rock your world.  Are you okay?
__Sheldon His name isn't Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
__Raj What would you name him?
__Sheldon An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.
__Howard All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast's Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.
__Sheldon Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I'll suck nothing. Of course I'm joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
__Howard That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?
__Raj Oh, I really don't care anymore
__Leonard God, I had the most horrible night.
__Raj What happened?
__Sheldon Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
__Howard Shiksa. Shik-sa.
__Sheldon Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn't spoken for long.
__Howard Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you're wrong again.
__Sheldon We haven't established that I'm wrong once.
__Howard All right. Tell you what, let's go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor
__ Crawley tell us what kind of cricket Toby is.
__ He's a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy.
__Leonard I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
__Howard You're such a girl. They're just bugs.
__Raj Yeah, well, I don't like bugs, okay? They freak me out.
__Sheldon Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You're welcome
__Prof Crawley Don't knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world's leading expert on the dung beetle?
__Sheldon Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?
__Prof Crawley Who wants to know?
__Sheldon I'm Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
__Sheldon I'm sorry?
__Prof Crawley I haven't even packed yet, and you're already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.
__Howard No, you don't understand. We just want to ask you a question.
__Prof Crawley Let me ask you one first. What's a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?
__Raj Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
__Prof Crawley What's your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?
__Raj I'm from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
__Sheldon No, no. We're here, let's settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?
__Prof Crawley Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that's going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we're not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We're talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
__Howard Well, could you look at Toby?
__Sheldon Told you.
__Prof Crawley It's a field cricket.
__Howard Yes!
__Sheldon No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
__Prof Crawley Young man, I've been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.
__Sheldon Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
__Prof Crawley Let me show you something. See that? That's a Crawley's dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that's a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can't. That tramp took me for everything!
__Raj Enjoy Oxnard. I'm sure your daughter's looking forward to having you.
__Sheldon Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
__Penny What do you have a safe deposit box for?
__Sheldon Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
__Penny What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can't be very popular.
__Sheldon Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.
__Penny Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm not feeling so hot either.
__Sheldon Why would that make me feel better?
__Penny I don't know, empathy? Anyway, I'm just saying that you're feeling upset about something with Howard, and I'm upset about something with Leonard.
__Sheldon Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That's an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley's chicken.
__Penny What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?
__Sheldon A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
__Sheldon Well, I wish I could.
__Penny No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
__Sheldon Of course I'm right What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?
__Penny No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.
__Sheldon I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
__Leonard Hey. What's going on?
__Sheldon Oh, you'd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
__Leonard Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
__Sheldon Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
__Leonard Right, right. You're saying you talked to Penny?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Interesting.
__Sheldon Hardly.
__Leonard Excuse me.
__Leonard Little bit.
__Sheldon Hmm. Oh, who cares?
__Leonard Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?
__Penny Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
__Leonard Is that what you want?
__Penny I don't know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.
__Leonard I guess.
__Penny It would take the pressure off.
__Leonard It would, wouldn't it?
__Penny So, we'll just be friends.
__Leonard Good, good.
__Penny Come here.
__Sheldon No.
__Penny Why not?
__Sheldon Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
__Penny Are you fun in any of them?
__Sheldon The math would suggest that in a few I'm a clown made of candy. But I don't dance.
__Penny All right, want some French toast?
__Sheldon It's Oatmeal Day.
__Penny Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.
__Sheldon Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?
__Leonard Morning.
__Sheldon Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.
__Leonard Sorry. I haven't given her your schedule yet.
__Sheldon It's an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.
__Leonard We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.
__Sheldon I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
__Leonard No, her bed kind of… broke.
__Sheldon That doesn't seem likely. Her bed's of sturdy construction. Even the addition
__ of a second normal size human being wouldn't cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself.
__ A homunculus?
__Leonard Perfectly formed miniature human being.
__Penny Oh, you're my little homunculus.
__Leonard Don't do that.
__Penny Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
__Penny Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass.
__Sheldon I'm sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.
__Penny You know what, I give up. He's impossible.
__Sheldon I can't be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he's improbable.”
__Sheldon What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.
__Leonard I'm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
__Sheldon You can catch even more flies with manure. What's your point?
__Leonard It's a…
__Sheldon Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it's Monday.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Wow!
__Penny I know. What are the odds?
__Sheldon Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…
__Leonard Sheldon! it's an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?
__Penny Ooh, Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.
__Leonard Come on, you guys, let it go.
__Penny Fine, whatever. Are you finished?
__Leonard What was that?
__Sheldon You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
__Leonard It does. But in my experience, you don't.
__Sheldon There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
__Leonard Yeah, yeah, now that's you, obnoxious and insufferable.
__Howard What's going on, day dwellers?
__Penny Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don't ask, don't tell?
__Howard No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?
__Penny Oh, wow, you're actually going out like that?
__Howard No, no. I'm going out like this.
__Leonard Howard, what did you do?
__Howard They're called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.
__Sheldon You know, I've always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.
__Howard Really?
__Howard Okay, how about you two? Look, I've got some extra tat sleeves.
__Leonard Why are you carrying extras?
__Howard Well, In case I snag one on someone's nipple ring.
__Penny Uh, yeah, I think we'll pass.
__Howard Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?
__Leonard In this case, you bet she is.
__Howard Yes, she's pushy and yes, he's whipped, but that's not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.
__Leonard They're gonna get beaten up at that club.
__Penny They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.
__Penny Thank you.
__Howard It'd help if you weren't drinking light beer.
__Raj Oh, what's so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?
__Howard Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?
__Raj No, I'm behind on my wiki-reading I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.
__Howard What?
__Raj Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.
__Howard Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.
__Raj Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.
__Girl Good for you.
__Howard I'm actually much morelost than he is.
__Girl Nice ink.
__Howard Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?
__Girl Two light beers.
__Raj Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?
__Second girl What's your names?
__Howard I'm Howard.
__Raj Raj.
__Girl I'm Bethany.
__Howard Nice to meet you, Bethany.
__Raj Yes, very nice.
__Bethany Nice to meet you too.
__Second girl I'm Sarah. Not that anyone cares.
__Raj Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
__Leonard Demon Samurai.
__Sheldon And it's not a cartoon, it's anime.
__Penny Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.
__Sheldon You're here a lot now.
__Penny Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip.
__Sheldon Thank you. Chocolate?
__Penny Yes please.  Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I…  You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall.  You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work…
__Leonard Okay, I know what you're doing.
__Sheldon Really?
__Leonard Yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
__Sheldon Very good. Chocolate?
__Leonard No, I don't want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat.
__Sheldon Actually, it turns out I can.
__Leonard Well, you shouldn't.
__Sheldon There's just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren't happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.
__Leonard No, this has to stop now.
__Sheldon I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I'm just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.
__Sheldon Are you saying that I'm forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?
__Leonard Yes, you're forbidden.
__Sheldon Bad Leonard.
__Howard Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.
__Raj Goth food.
__Sarah What's goth food?
__Raj Uh… blackened salmon?
__Bethany No, I meant what do you do for jobs?
__Raj Oh, we're scientists.
__Howard Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.
__Bethany What are the dark sciences
__Raj Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.
__Howard Oy vay.
__Raj That sounds really cool.
__Howard Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.
__Raj So what do you gals do?
__Howard Really? How about that? I've been to the Gap.
__Raj Yeah, I've been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.
__Sarah I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.
__Bethany Yeah. Why don't we go somewhere else and have some fun?
__Howard Okay.
__Raj Sure, we like fun.
__Howard We are fun people.
__Raj Dark and fun.
__Bethany Come on, I know a place you'll really dig.
__Howard Did you bring the black condoms?
__Raj In my fanny pack.
__Howard Let's go.
__Howard Not particularly.
__Leonard What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
__Sheldon Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.
__Leonard You're not squirting her in the face with water.
__Sheldon No, of course not. We're talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.
__Leonard Forget it.
__Sheldon Oh, come on, you can't tell me that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.
__Leonard I'm not. And Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.
__Sheldon You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?
__Leonard Yes.
__ Sheldon You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?
__ You're not changing how Penny laughs.
__Sheldon No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.
__Penny Uh, sorry guys, that girl is  freaky!
__Sheldon Come again?
__Penny Freaky.
__Sheldon Freaky?
__Penny Yeah, freaky.
__Sheldon Have a chocolate.
__Penny Thank you.
__Howard Uh, yeah!
__Raj What is your mother going to say?
__Howard She's not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.
__Bethany What are you going to get, Howard?
__Howard Well, I can't really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.
__Bethany Kermit the Frog?
__Howard You know  Hi ho, I'm on Howard's butt!
__Bethany Get the mean little skull, and I'll see if I can make him smile.
__Howard Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.
__Sarah What are you going to get, Raj?
__Tattooist Okay, here we go.
__Howard Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
__Howard I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!
__Tattooist I'm putting on the stencil.
__Howard What comes after the stencil?
__Tattooist This.
__Howard Aaaaaargh! Okay, that's it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.
__Bethany What's the big deal, you've done this before.
__Howard No, I haven't, look.  I'm sorry, I'm a fraud, he's a fraud.
__Raj We're both frauds.
__Howard Yeah, I think I covered that.
__Raj But I was summing up.
__Howard We're not goth, we're just guys.
__Raj Very, very smart guys.
__Bethany So you were totally scamming us?
__Howard Yes. And I wouldn't blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
__Bethany I'm leaving.
__Sarah I'm leaving too. Not that anyone cares.
__Raj When we tell this story, let's end it differently.
__Howard What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?
__Penny Of course.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__ Mmm, these are so good
__Leonard Unbelievable.
__Leonard I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.
__Penny well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.
__Penny Yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have to be quiet.
__Leonard Let's go.
__Sheldon Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
__Howard What's that got to do with the story?
__Raj Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
__Howard Fine, they smelled good.
__Raj Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.
__Howard Whatever.
__Howard No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we'll pick.
__Raj I'm sorry. Go on.
__Howard Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.
__Raj But we don't have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
__Howard We say they're in a very intimate area.
__Howard Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.
__Raj But we just got tattoos. Wouldn't we be concerned about bacterial infection?
__Howard True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls.
__Raj Wow. What a great night.
__Howard Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.
__Raj Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.
__Howard Could happen.
__Raj I wonder how they smell.
__Leonard What do you mean?
__Sheldon Well, the instructions are very clear, don't feed the gremlins after midnight, don't get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?
__Penny Hi, guys. Hi, honey.
__Leonard Hey.
__Howard Ooh, we're honey now, are we?
__Sheldon Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
__Penny You're boring people sweetie.
__Sheldon Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.
__Penny So, what are you guys doing?
__Howard Celebrating Columbus Day.
__Penny Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
__Sheldon The parade.
__Penny Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they're calling it off on account of my brother's trial.
__Leonard What's he on trial for?
__Penny Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you'd actually like my brother, he's kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I'd have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.
__Leonard Oh. I'll be there.
__Sheldon Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
__Penny I guess I could serve both.
__Sheldon You guess? You don't seem to have much of a handle on this.
__Howard Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.
__Penny Tur-briska-fil?
__Howard Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It's not as good as it sounds.
__Penny Raj, what about you?
__Howard Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?  All right, this year, you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don't even chew it. I swallow it like pills.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother's tur-brka-fil.
__Penny Hard to believe, but go on.
__Howard The bad news is, he says he's getting deported.
__Leonard What do you mean, he's getting deported?
__Sheldon I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I'd choose pirate.
__Howard Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?
__Penny Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.
__Sheldon Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that's an all-male profession.
__Howard Okay, she's gone.
__Raj Sorry. I lost my cool.
__Leonard So, what's going on?
__Raj Okay, here's the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.
__Howard So?
__Raj So, my visa's only good as long as I'm employed at the university, and when they find out I've got squat, they're going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.
__Raj You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?
__Sheldon And you've continued to take the university's money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
__Raj I don't want to go back to India. It's hot and loud, and there's so many people. You have no idea, they're everywhere.
__Howard Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?
__Penny Why doesn't he just get another job?
__Howard What are you asking me for? I don't know if you can talk now or not.
__ believe you me, is really not that special.
__ Don't worry, you'll find another job.
__Raj Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
__Raj Hello Sheldon.
__Sheldon Forgive me, as you know, I'm no adept at reading facial cues, but I'm going to take a stab here, you're either sad or nauseated.
__Raj I'm sad.
__Sheldon I was going to say sad. I don't know why I hedged.
__Raj What are you eating?
__Sheldon Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
__Raj Oh, beefaroni. I think I'll miss you most of all.
__Leonard I've always been a little confused about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?
__Raj We believe cows are gods.
__Sheldon Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.
__Raj Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out, I swear to cow!
__Sheldon I'm sorry.
__Raj Me, too. I'm just, I'm a little on edge.
__Sheldon Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.
__Raj Thank you.
__Sheldon And you're wrong about Hinduism and cows.
__Howard Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.
__Raj You, you're kidding. That's fantastic!
__Howard Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.
__Raj I'm on it.
__Sheldon That's happy, right?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Nailed it.
__Raj No, no, it's a very promising area. In a perfect world I'd spend several more years on it. But I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.
__Prof Laughlin Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?
__Raj It's a little early, isn't it?
__Prof Laughlin Not on Proxima Centauri.
__Raj That's very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don't mind, I'll hold off until sunset on titan.
__Prof Laughlin Oh, well done. I have a feeling you're going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.
__Raj Thank you, sir.
__Woman I'm sorry. Am I late?
__Prof Laughlin No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She'll be heading up our data analysis team.
__Dr Millstone It's nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias? (During this, Raj surreptitiously wanders over to where Prof Laughlin's drinks are, pours himself a large sherry and knocks it back in one.)
__Raj Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.
__Dr Millstone That's just fascinating.
__Raj Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?
__Raj You know, he's British, I'm Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven't liked us very much.
__Leonard Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.
__Raj That's okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that's it. That was my last hope. I'm going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.
__Howard I'm really going to miss you.
__Raj Will you come visit me in India?
__Howard Gee, that's, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?
__Raj Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
__Howard Tell you what, we'll skype.
__Sheldon Gentlemen.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?
__Raj No.
__Sheldon I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he's met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…
__Leonard Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, if you didn't cheer at my entrance, it's too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.
__Raj You want me to work with you?
__Raj Okay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way, but I'd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
__Sheldon For me.
__Sheldon Of course I'm busy.
__Raj Shall I wait?
__Sheldon Yes, please.  How may I help you?
__Raj I've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
__Sheldon For me.
__Raj Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
__Sheldon I'm impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.
__Raj Thank you.
__Sheldon I reject them all.
__Raj Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, I believe you've misunderstood. I'm not giving you the job. I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we'll get started with the interview.
__Raj Wha… You're kidding!
__Sheldon Please.
__Raj All right.
__Sheldon So, that's what you wear to an interview?
__Raj Come on, dude, we've been friends for years.
__Sheldon Oh, pulling strings, are we?
__Raj Sheldon, for God's sakes, don't make me beg.
__Sheldon Bazinga! You've fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I'm your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
__Leonard Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don't have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.
__Penny Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?
__Leonard What are you thinking?
__Penny Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot a make out.
__Leonard You are a dirty girl.
__Penny Oh, God, how did he know?
__Howard Hello.
__Leonard Hi, Howard.
__Howard Am I interrupting?
__Leonard Little bit, yeah.
__Howard Guess I should have called.
__Penny Yeah, maybe.
__Howard Tonight's the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Howard But he's working with Sheldon.
__Penny Yes, we know.
__Howard Want me to leave?
__Leonard You know, whatever.
__Howard Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.
__ Yikes.
__ Hey, I happen to love this movie.
__Howard Fine, let's watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.
__Sheldon I'm the boss. I make the jokes.
__Raj Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.
__Sheldon This is not the time for joking. We're doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.
__Raj All right, let's buckle down and work.
__ Sheldon.
__Sheldon What?
__Raj I need an aspirin.
__Sheldon Top desk drawer.
__Raj Thank you.
__Sheldon Alright?
__Raj Yes.
__Sheldon Good.
__Penny Leonard, honey, you don't have to say thank you every time we have sex.
__Leonard Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you're going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
__Leonard What are you doing here?
__Penny Oh, kill me.
__Howard By the way, I couldn't help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.
__Penny See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn't have had to hear that.
__Howard What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?
__Penny Do something.
__Leonard Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.
__Howard Sure. ‘sup, homes?
__Leonard Uh, please understand that it's not that we don't want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.
__Howard Oh. I get it, I'm the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I'll get out of your way. Uh, you're gonna want to eat those eggs while they're still hot.
__Leonard Thank you. There's lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.
__Penny That's great.
__Howard Ill just hang out with my mom. That's always fun.
__Leonard Good.
__Penny Are we terrible people?
__Leonard I don't know. What do you want me to do?
__Leonard Are you sure?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Okay. Howard come back.
__Howard Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.
__Sheldon Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
__Raj I'm the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
__Sheldon Astro means star.
__Raj Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I'd be kicking your butt.
__Sheldon English is your native language.
__Raj Okay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!
__Sheldon There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
__Raj My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.
__Sheldon Caca?
__Raj It means doo-doo.
__Sheldon All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…
__Raj Aha! So I am working with you.
__Sheldon In this context, with me means for me.
__Raj Ah, well, in this context…
__Sheldon Oh! If I'm wrong, prove it.
__Raj Okay. Here's where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
__Sheldon No, no, no, you've misstated the atomic weight of the target.
__Raj Let me finish.
__Sheldon You're defacing my work.
__Raj I'm not defacing it, I'm fixing it.
__Sheldon Give me the eraser.
__Raj No.
__Sheldon I said give it to me.
__Raj Come and get it.
__Sheldon Fine.  Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!
__Raj You are not my superior.
__Sheldon I am in every way.
__Raj Oh, yeah? Can you do this? (Performs  complex finger trick*) Nice working with you. I'm sorry, for you.
__Raj I'm busy.
__Sheldon Doing what?  All right, you've made your point.
__Raj What do you want, Sheldon?
__Sheldon I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
__Raj So you were wrong.
__Sheldon I didn't say that.
__Raj That's the only logical inference.
__Sheldon In this context for me could mean with me.
__Raj All right, but I have some conditions.
__Sheldon I reject them all.
__Raj I'll take the job. See you Monday.
__Raj How did you get here?
__Sheldon I walked.
__Raj So walk home.
__Sheldon I can't. There's a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.
__Raj All right.
__Leonard Okay, well, then I'll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That's right, I did it. I cut 'em.
__Penny Um, I have a question.
__Leonard Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.
__Howard Unless you have the carrot power.
__Penny Okay, I've got another question. When does this get fun?
__Howard Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
__Leonard Just play a potion card.
__Penny Which one?
__Sheldon It doesn't matter. You can't possibly win.
__Leonard Sheldon, don't ruin the game.
__Penny How could he ruin the game?
__Sheldon Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.
__Leonard See? Ruined.
__Penny Sheldon, that is incredible.
__Sheldon From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.
__Leonard Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
__Sheldon Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I've told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.
__Howard Well, I guess game's over.
__Penny Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.
__Leonard Why?
__Penny Because the last me I didn't go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
__Howard Not Ka. Ka-ah.
__Penny Ba-eye.
__Leonard See ya. Still can't believe she's going out with me.
__Raj Nobody can.
__Howard That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.
__Leonard What?
__Howard You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.
__Leonard Yeah, I don't remember that.
__Sheldon June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.
__Leonard Oh, yeah.
__Howard So you've been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where's my shorty, Morty?
__Leonard Howard, you can't hold me to that.
__Howard Why not?
__Raj Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?
__Sheldon You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
__Raj Oh, so that's how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don't get a hot girlfriend?
__Howard Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.
__Raj Damn.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, no.
__Leonard But you have a whole bunch of 'em.
__Sheldon Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I'll add a guest napkin, but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today.  Good luck. That's the face napkin.
__Howard So, have you talked to Penny yet?
__Leonard No, I haven't.
__Howard Why not?
__Leonard Because I've been busy, because I haven't figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can't stress how key this is, because I don't want to.
__Howard Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.
__Leonard It's not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you'd like to never hear from again?
__Howard Come on, I'm smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.
__Raj It's true. I've seen him at the beach, he's like a human chicken wing.
__Howard Leonard, come on.
__Leonard Fine. I'll ask if she has a friend for you.
__Howard A hot friend.
__Leonard Right.
__Howard And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they're 20.
__Leonard I'll see what I can do.
__Raj Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?
__Sheldon I'd imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you're wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.
__Raj Why don't I just tell you what I heard today.
__Sheldon That would probably save us some time.
__Raj Saturday night at the comic book store, they're having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.
__Raj What about the money?
__Sheldon I have money.
__Raj But this is other money.
__Sheldon How does it different from the money I have?
__Raj Half of it will be mine.
__Sheldon Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
__Raj Leonard, help.
__Leonard Are you kidding? I couldn't even talk him into giving me one of his freakin' napkins.
__Leonard Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?
__Penny You mean, like a pinky swear?
__Leonard Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.
__Penny Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?
__Leonard Yeah, I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.
__Penny Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn't speak again until middle school.
__Leonard Over puppets?
__Penny The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.
__Leonard Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.
__Penny Okay, I don't know where you're going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.
__Leonard No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we'd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.
__Penny And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
__Leonard Well, I sure as hell wasn't going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…
__Leonard Come on, it doesn't have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy.
__Penny The problem isn't what's on the inside. It's the creepy candy coating.
__Leonard Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
__Penny Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.
__Stuart Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine's coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?
__Sheldon Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
__Stuart All right, I won't set one aside for you.
__Sheldon But I must have it.
__Stuart Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
__Raj Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
__Stuart Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.
__ The Next Generation is going to be participating in your tournament?
__ Oh, I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?
__Sheldon You don't understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.
__Raj Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you're playing in the tournament. Sign here.
__Sheldon I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
__Raj Ooh, it'll be like a reunion then. Sign here.
__Sheldon My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
__Raj Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.
__Sheldon It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.
__Raj Okay, I get it, he's a bad guy. Sign here.
__Sheldon In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.
__Raj No doubt, sign here.
__Sheldon From hell's heart, I stab at thee.
__Stuart All right, Raj, looks like you're teamed up with die, Wil Wheaton, die.
__Penny She's adorable, Howard. I think you'll like her.
__Howard Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?
__Penny No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.
__Howard Good, good.
__Penny I just told her you're an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…
__Howard Six if you count Klingon.
__Leonard Girls don't count Klingon, Howard. Right?
__Penny Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
__Penny I'm kidding.
__Leonard Another delightful surprise for her.
__Sheldon My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
__Raj Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!
__Raj You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It's a totally different set of characters.
__Sheldon Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
__Raj Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we'll face off for the championship.
__Sheldon So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.
__Raj Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It's really lame.
__Sheldon Silence!
__Bernadette Microbiology.
__Howard Oh, cool. So you could study me.
__Bernadette I don't understand.
__Howard Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
__Bernadette I know, I'm studying it.
__Bernadette Are you sure?
__Howard Do you like science-fiction?
__Bernadette No.
__Howard Role-playing games?
__Bernadette Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
__Howard Either.
__Bernadette No.
__Penny Yeah, well, it's your fault.
__Leonard I had to ask. You didn't have to say yes.
__Howard You like magic?
__Bernadette Not really.
__Howard Okay.
__Leonard Long, long night.
__Wil Wheaton Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?
__Stuart I believe so.
__Wil Wheaton What is wrong with him?
__Stuart Everyone has a different theory.
__Bernadette I use them. I don't like them.
__Howard Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
__Bernadette A puppy once bit my face.
__Howard Of course it did.
__Leonard How about that? Einstein was wrong.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Approaching the speed of light doesn't slow down time. Approaching them does.
__Howard Excuse me. Oh, damn. It's my mother.
__Bernadette Are you going to answer it?
__Howard I'm torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn't want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.
__Howard Not as crazy as my mother makes me.
__Bernadette Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you've had a healthy lunch?
__Howard My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.
__Bernadette Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you're nine years old?
__Howard You live with your mother?
__Bernadette No. That's the sad part.
__Howard Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children.
__Bernadette That's nothing. I couldn't ride a bicycle 'cause my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.
__Howard Oh, wow. You didn't, did you?
__Bernadette Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
__Howard Corolla!
__Bernadette Oh!
__Howard More wine?
__Bernadette I'd love some.
__Bernadette Why?
__Howard A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.
__Bernadette Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.
__Howard It's a date.
__Penny Am I a matchmaker or what?
__Stuart Nest of snakes.
__Sheldon Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
__Wil Wheaton Invisibility spell.
__Sheldon Luminescence spell.
__Wil Wheaton Water nymph.
__Sheldon Fire demon.
__Wil Wheaton Two-headed tiger.
__Sheldon Three-headed lion.
__Wil Wheaton Sulphur.
__Sheldon Brimstone.
__Raj Problem, Wil Wheaton?
__Wil Wheaton Hang on.
__Sheldon You're holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.
__Wil Wheaton I think he's got me.
__Sheldon The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.
__Wil Wheaton What?
__Sheldon You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.
__Wil Wheaton You went to the '95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.
__Sheldon Your mee-maw died? That's terrible.
__Wil Wheaton Yeah, it was. But I'm really sorry that I disappointed you.
__Sheldon No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I'd be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.
__Wil Wheaton It's special relationship, isn't it, between a boy and his grandmother?
__Sheldon Oh, yes.
__Raj Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!
__Wil Wheaton It's okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor.
__Raj What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell's heart, stab at him!
__Sheldon I can't.
__Raj Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
__Sheldon No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.
__Raj No! Not enchanted bunny!
__Wil Wheaton I call my mee-maw nana. And she's going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie.
__Sheldon I… I… I don't understand. Your grandmother's alive?
__Wil Wheaton Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let's get our prize money.
__Stuart That was fun.
__Sheldon Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!
__Howard Kites ho!
__Raj Kites ho!
__All three Kites, ho!
__Sheldon Excuse me. You're misusing the word ho. It's an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!
__The three guys Kites, ho!
__Penny Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?
__Leonard If you're referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.
__Leonard We're heading out for some kite fighting.
__Penny Kite fighting?
__Leonard Oh, yeah. It's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.
__Sheldon Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.
__Leonard You want to come watch?
__Penny Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I've got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we're just gonna watch the Nebraska game.
__Leonard Oh. Football, sure.
__Howard Good guess.
__Penny I would've invited you, but I know you're not a football fan.
__Leonard No, no, I'm not, so, great. You've got plans doing something you like, I've got plans doing something I like, so it's good.
__Penny Well, maybe we'll hang out later, you know, after everybody's gone.
__Leonard Yeah, great.
__Penny See ya.
__Leonard Well, this sucks.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
__Raj Leonard just realized that Penny's been hiding him from her friends because he's a tiny, little man who flies kites.
__Sheldon Oh, that certainly would suck.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?
__Sheldon Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.
__Leonard Maybe Koothrappali's right, maybe I embarrass her.
__Sheldon You're embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Sheldon Sorry won't bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
__Raj Oh, they think we're flanking, they're playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…
__Howard Whoa! Did you see that?
__Raj See what?
__Howard That chick, she smiled at me.
__Raj No, she didn't.
__Howard Yes, she did.
__Raj Come on, scissors, scissors!
__Howard Hold my line.
__Raj Wait, what are you doing? I can't scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!
__Sheldon Victory!
__Raj Son of a bitch.
__Howard What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.
__Raj If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
__Howard I would've caught up to her if I hadn't pulled a hammy.
__Raj Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don't have a hammy.
__Leonard So, Penny doesn't want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?
__Sheldon Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings because she's scouting for a new mate and doesn't want to do it in front of you.
__Leonard Oh, how kind of her.
__Sheldon Agreed. Most primates don't show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
__Raj You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don't have a shot with.
__Howard I totally had a shot.
__Raj With a woman you were chasing through a park? That's not a shot, that's a felony. What's worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don't suppose there's any chance you could give me my kite back?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture.  I have your kite. I have your kite.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard How was your football party?
__Penny It was pretty good. We won.
__Leonard Oh, that's excellent. It's a weird figure of speech, isn't it, we won when you weren't
__ actually playing. When we watch Star Wars, we don't say, we defeated the Empire.
__ I'm glad to hear it.
__Leonard Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?
__Penny Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?
__Leonard Well, you know, I just noticed I haven't really met any of them.
__Penny Sure you have.
__Leonard Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?
__Penny Of course not.
__Leonard Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don't you stop me?
__Penny Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn't want you to be bored.
__Leonard I wouldn't be bored. Why would I be bored?
__Leonard Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren't geniuses.
__Penny Like who?
__Penny Okay, great. Well, then why don't you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.
__Leonard Another football game?
__Penny They have them every week.
__Leonard Did not know that.
__Penny You wanted to meet my friends.
__Leonard Sure, sure, just I don't know much about football.
__Penny Oh, that's okay, a lot of the guys' girlfriends don't know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.
__Leonard Great.
__Raj Really? The only thing I've learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.
__Leonard Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.
__Raj I'm just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.
__Howard Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.
__Raj I'm sorry, are you under the impression that we're still friends?
__Howard Oh come on, you're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?
__Howard But I had a shot with that jogger.
__Raj Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.
__Howard It's not a little scooter. It's the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?
__Leonard There's no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?
__Howard All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.
__Leonard Sacks, sacks…
__Sheldon It's football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
__Leonard Huh… Scrimmage…
__Sheldon The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
__Leonard Oh.
__Howard Sheldon knows football?
__Leonard Apparently.
__Howard I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?
__Leonard Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
__Sheldon I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.
__Leonard Unbelievable.
__Sheldon If you're interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken.
__Leonard So you could teach me?
__Sheldon Football or chicken-fried meats?
__Leonard Football. I'm going to Penny's on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don't want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
__Sheldon If you want to blend in with Penny's friends, I'd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
__Sheldon That's exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.
__Leonard Please, I'm asking you as a friend.
__Sheldon Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Leonard I really appreciate this.
__Sheldon Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.
__Leonard I'm sorry?
__Sheldon That's how my father always began our football conversations. And if you'd like, after the game, I'll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.
__Sheldon When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's?
__Leonard What's wrong with a football jersey?
__Sheldon Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.
__Leonard I's the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can't believe they had one for dogs.
__Sheldon Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.
__Leonard Anyway, wish me luck.
__Sheldon Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?
__Leonard Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way.
__Sheldon How would you put it?
__Leonard Yeah, okay, like you said.
__Sheldon Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don't you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.
__Leonard Good-Bye, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
__Leonard Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at.
__Sheldon What's funny about Cylon toast?
__Howard Hey, pal.
__Raj What do you want?
__Howard I brought you a little gift. New kite.
__Raj The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.
__Howard Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?
__Raj Wow, you just don't get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn't going to make our problem just go away.
__Howard Look, I admit I haven't always been the best friend I could be.
__Raj You've been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.
__Howard Stipulated.
__Raj And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you're not even there.
__Howard I know, I know.
__Raj And where were you?
__Raj You're impossible.
__Howard Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.
__Raj Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You're just a douche.
__Howard No. You know what? Maybe that's what this whole thing's about. You're not mad at me, you're mad at yourself.
__Raj No, I'm mad at you. I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.
__Howard Fine. You're mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We'll go anywhere you want.
__Raj I don't know.
__Howard Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.
__Raj I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
__Raj Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?
__Penny Sweetie, that's a highlight from the '98 championship game.
__Leonard Oh. Did not know that.
__Penny How much beer have you had?
__Leonard None, why?
__Penny Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we're back live.
__Leonard Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.
__Guy in baseball hat Oh, where's the flag, that's intentional grounding.
__Second guy Totally.
__Leonard That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can't believe they're not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.
__Penny Here, have some pizza, sweetie.
__Leonard Penny, you know I'm lactose intolerant.
__Penny I know. I just need you stop talking.
__Sheldon Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
__Penny Sheldon, come in.
__Sheldon Thank you. I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.
__Penny There's some in the fridge.
__Sheldon You shouldn't keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.
__Penny On Earth, we say thank you.
__Sheldon So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?
__Leonard Mimesis?
__Sheldon You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
__Leonard What the hell are you talking about?
__Leonard Oh, I guess so.
__Sheldon Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?
__Leonard I don't want to fly kites, Sheldon. We're watching football here.
__Sheldon I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
__Leonard Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he's challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he's right, 'cause if he's not, it'll cost him one of his three time-Outs.
__Penny You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn't mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.
__Leonard No, I'll watch the end of the game. Besides, there's only three minutes left.
__Penny Until half time.
__Leonard This is just half? We've been here for hours.
__Penny And you're gonna be here for a couple more.
__Leonard Oh, you're kidding me.
__Penny No.
__Leonard Nice meeting all of you.
__Penny So, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend. He is really smart.
__Howard My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender's and have some pie.
__Raj I'd like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
__Howard Good. I'm glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?
__Raj Fine. Go ahead.
__Howard No. This is our day.
__Raj If you want to chase after her, chase after her.
__Howard Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn't have a shot with a girl like that.
__Raj Don't put yourself down. You're a very attractive man.
__Howard You think so?
__Raj Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn't kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.
__Howard Yeah, well, it doesn't matter ‘cause she wasn't really smiling at me.
__Raj Actually, in this case, I think she was.
__Howard Really?
__Raj Yeah.
__Howard Bye.
__Raj What a douche.
__Sheldon Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It's like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.
__Leonard We must not be playing it right.
__Penny All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.
__Sheldon Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
__Penny Yay.
__Sheldon You're a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two'll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.
__Leonard Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don't think we can play on Sunday.
__Sheldon Why not?
__Leonard Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
__Penny Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.
__Leonard There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can't play 'cause I'm going with her, right?
__Penny Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.
__Leonard Wait. What are you talking about?
__Penny My friend, Justin.
__Sheldon Pay attention, Leonard. That's why she can't play on Sunday.
__Sheldon Your turn, Leonard.
__Penny I told you about him.
__Leonard No, you didn't.
__Sheldon Roll the dice, Leonard.
__Penny Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he's coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.
__Sheldon Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?
__Leonard Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
__Penny He's not some guy. He's my friend.
__Leonard So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you're now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?
__Penny Well, he's definitely not gay.
__Leonard Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend's couch. Yippee.
__Penny Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.
__Leonard Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
__Sheldon I'll just roll for you.
__Penny Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
__Leonard What was your first clue?
__Sheldon Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
__Penny You know what? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.
__Leonard I'm not talking to you like you're an idiot! I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!
__Sheldon You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
__Penny How is that not talking to me like I'm an idiot? It's my friend, it's my couch, and it's my freakin' life!
__Sheldon It's also your roll.
__Leonard You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don't you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?
__Penny Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it's none of your business!
__Leonard Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
__Penny Oh, now I'm a child? Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!
__Penny Oh, you are such a…  What the hell is he doing?
__Leonard He's drowning us out. He doesn't like fighting.
__Penny Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!
__Leonard I heard of 'em. Didn't know they were a band. Sheldon, she's gone. You can turn off the blender.
__Sheldon Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
__Sheldon Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny's forfeit, you have become the world's first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
__ Credits sequence
__Sheldon Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.
__Leonard I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.
__Sheldon It's called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?
__Leonard An old boyfriend who's definitely not gay. That's what a guy likes to hear, definitely.
__Sheldon All right, I'll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.
__Leonard And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
__Sheldon Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.
__Leonard What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I'm cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn't matter if you're cool or not because I'm Penny and I'm pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you're doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I'm doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!
__Sheldon Leonard! Stop the car!
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I can't listen to the two of you fight anymore.
__Leonard Calm down, we'll make the movie.
__Sheldon I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we'll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.
__Raj Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.
__Sheldon Go, go, Power Rangers, go!
__Penny Hey.
__Leonard Hey. We're, uh, going to the movies.
__Sheldon No, we're not. We're standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.
__Leonard Hang on. They're showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn't want to come, would you?
__Penny Not really, no.
__Sheldon All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone's civil, nobody's fighting. Have a nice evening.
__Leonard Just give us a minute.
__Howard Oh, take all the time you need.
__Leonard So, are we going to talk about last night?
__Penny Are you ready to apologize?
__Leonard No.
__Leonard Oh, come on. This is stupid.
__Penny Oh, there it is again! You think I'm stupid!
__Leonard No, there's a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.
__Leonard No, there isn't! They're synonyms!
__Raj Well, that was rather unpleasant.
__Howard Yeah, I don't think I need my preshow urination anymore.
__Sheldon Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we're going to be late for the movies.
__Sheldon Got it.
__Howard Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It'll help take your mind off things.
__Stuart Hey, guys. What's going on?
__Leonard Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.
__Stuart Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let's face it, that's just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.
__Leonard Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
__Howard No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line.
__Leonard Thank you!
__Howard But if she dumps you, she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you'll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?
__Leonard I am not going to fold.
__Raj Well, excuse me, I don't think Penny's out of line at all. You don't own her. It's like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”
__Howard Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should've backed off.
__Raj You mean like when a guy's upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn't show up because he's doing a juice fast with his mother?
__Howard I didn't know you were upset about that.
__Raj Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.
__Raj Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you're upset with a guy named Howard!
__Howard I said I'm sorry.
__Raj Sorry doesn't make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!
__Howard Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “Have you ever peed so much in your life?”
__Raj Oh, my God, you are such a mama's boy.
__Howard Hey, don't bring my mother into this!
__Sheldon Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, 'cause I'm drunk as hell and you're still here! Stop yelling! You're making Sheldon cry! I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.
__Howard Boy, what got him so upset?
__Raj Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon's upset.
__Sheldon This is a restaurant. It's lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you'd be familiar with the paradigm.
__Sheldon No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.
__Penny Well, that's not gonna happen.
__Sheldon I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.
__Penny Which is?
__Sheldon I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
__Penny I'm busy.
__Sheldon Excuse me, miss. I'd like to order lunch.
__Penny Fine. What do you want?
__Sheldon I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?
__Penny No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.
__Sheldon You can't make a half-sandwich. If it's not half of a whole sandwich, it's just a small sandwich.
__Penny Okay, fine, it's soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?
__Sheldon Of course not. I'll have my usual.
__Penny Great.
__Sheldon Aren't you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
__Penny Don't you usually get lemonade?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Do you want lemonade?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Anything else?
__Sheldon Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.
__Penny I am not going to apologize. I've done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
__Sheldon Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
__Penny Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.
__Sheldon I don't follow.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.
__Sheldon All right, let's assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.
__Penny Leonard is wrong.
__Sheldon Considering the number of transgressions you've committed that he's overlooked, don't you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?
__Penny I'm coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I've committed?
__Sheldon Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
__Penny Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you're making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?
__Sheldon Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.
__Penny My singing?
__Sheldon That's actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it.
__Penny Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn't he just said so?
__Sheldon Because, according to him, you're oversensitive and have a temper.
__Penny Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!
__Sheldon And she wonders why she's constantly undertipped.
__Sheldon Oh, good, you're home. I need you to do me a favour.
__Leonard Sure.
__Sheldon Go apologize to Penny.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Leonard!
__Sheldon Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.
__Penny I hear you don't like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.
__Leonard What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
__Leonard Okay, yeah, it's true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can't live with is you casually informing me that some guy's going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!
__Penny That isn't even your problem, the problem is you don't trust me!
__Leonard Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don't trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?
__Penny Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.
__Leonard Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
__Penny No, I'm going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!
__Leonard Why didn't you say so?
__Penny Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!
__Leonard Well, I can't read your mind, Penny!
__Penny Really? Why not? You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!
__Raj Stop knocking! It's open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can't come home for my cousin Sanjay's wedding.
__Mrs Koothrappali Sheldon, ask our son what we're supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.
__Raj I didn't ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.
__Mrs Koothrappali You should be thanking us!
__Dr Koothrappali Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.
__Mrs Koothrappali Because you're 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.
__Raj Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I'll come home for Sanjay's wedding.
__Leonard What are you doing? He's not a lost dog.
__Penny Hey, why don't you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?
__Leonard The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.
__Penny What stop sign?
__Leonard Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
__Howard I'm busy too, you answer it.
__Howard For God's sake, I don't need to hear that! Can't you just say, I'm busy?
__Howard's Mother Howard' I said I'm busy, but that wasn't good enough for you!
__Howard You know what? I hope it's one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Well, if it's a home invader, don't tell them I'm on the toilet!
__Howard There's no one there. You're hearing things, you crazy old lady!
__Stuart Yeah, he's, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Stuart Uh, Penny?
__Penny Yeah?
__Penny What do you mean?
__Stuart Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?
__Penny Oh, yeah, kind of. It's, it's no big thing.
__Stuart Oh, good, good.  I love you.
__Leonard I'm not leaving until you talk to me.
__Penny All right, what's going on?
__Leonard It's a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he's in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we're in, but he can't perceive us.
__Sheldon Don't flatter yourself. I'm just ignoring you.
__Penny Come on, Sheldon, let's go home. Look, we're done fighting.
__Sheldon I've heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I'm hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf, and my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.
__Penny Okay, there's going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.
__Sheldon Really? Where's your friend Justin going to sleep?
__Leonard Yeah, where's he gonna sleep?
__Penny Oh, my God, would you let this go?!
__Stuart I'd let it go.
__Leonard Why should I let it go? Why don't you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?  Oh, for God's sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them.
__Penny Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let's just… Sheldon, please,
__ try and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we're going to fight. But no matter what happens between us, we will always love you. Right, Leonard?
__ Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
__Penny You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?
__Sheldon I want that one.
__Penny Okay, you can have that one.
__Leonard Oh, come on, he's just going to play with it twice, and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk.
__Penny Buy him the robot, Leonard.
__Sheldon Can I get this comic book, too?
__Penny Yes, you can.
__Stuart We meet again.
__Leonard Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.
__Raj Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.
__Howard Anything yet?
__Leonard Uh, we have a signal, but there's no frame lock.
__Howard Hang on, how about now?
__Raj We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.
__Raj Big deal. Every time I watch that show it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
__Raj Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.
__Raj Yes, it's not the same without him.
__Howard Oh, this sucks, I'm switching back to Real Sex.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Sheldon help!
__Sheldon I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store. (At Penny's door, knock, knock, knock) Penny.  Penny.  Penny..
__Penny Come in! Hurry!
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny I'm back here.
__Sheldon (At Penny's bedroom door, knock, knock, knock) Penny.  Penny.  Penny..
__Penny Get in here! Hurry! Don't you dare knock.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.
__Sheldon Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Tubs are slippery.
__Penny I know. I slipped.
__Sheldon I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
__Penny Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?
__Sheldon They're holding umbrellas.
__Sheldon The ducks in my tub.
__Penny Uh-huh.
__Sheldon They're whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.
__Penny Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.
__Sheldon Well, assuming you're correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.
__Penny Okay, can you drive me?
__Sheldon I don't drive.
__Penny Well, I can't drive!
__Sheldon Well, it seems we've reached an impasse.
__Penny Ow.
__Sheldon But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
__Penny No, no, no, I can't wait that long, you got to help me, please.
__Sheldon All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
__Penny No one's saying that. Let's go.
__Sheldon Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.
__Raj Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.
__Howard Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.
__Raj Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?
__Howard Oh I don't know, 50, 55.
__Raj Oh, menopause, nature's birth control.
__Leonard Come on, you guys can't be that hard up.
__Howard I am.
__Raj Yeah, me, too.
__Howard Look, they gave me homemade cookies.
__Leonard Of course, they did. That's what grandmothers do.
__Raj So, what are we waiting for?
__Howard Relax, I said we'd stop by a little later after they have their nap.
__Raj Good idea. They'll be refreshed.
__Howard Cookie?
__Raj Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.
__Leonard Mmmm, not bad.
__Raj Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.
__Howard Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.
__Raj Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.
__Penny I don't need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.
__Sheldon My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
__Penny One was already in an accident.
__Sheldon That doesn't mean one won't be in another, especially if I'm driving.
__Penny Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!
__Sheldon Okay, here.
__Penny Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny No… No… Oh, that's cute.
__Sheldon We should have you checked for a concussion.
__Penny Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny But don't look.
__Sheldon Don't look?
__Penny I don't want you to see me naked.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, that's understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.
__Penny Yeah, great.
__Sheldon They always look. It never ends well.
__Penny Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.
__Sheldon Ok.
__Penny Is that my arm?
__Sheldon It doesn't feel like an arm.
__Penny Then, maybe you should let it go.
__Sheldon All righty.
__Howard Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky.
__Raj That's beautiful, dude. You should… You should write that down before someone steals it.
__Howard So, when do the meteors get here?
__Raj The meteors don't get here, the earth is moving into their path.
__Leonard I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It's moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.
__Raj Okay, how's that?
__Leonard Better. Thanks.
__Leonard What's so funny?
__Raj It's your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid.  Stars are pretty, aren't they?
__Penny You have your learner's permit, right?
__Penny Good.
__Sheldon Didn't work out well.
__Sheldon One moment. According to my driver's ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver's door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There's the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?
__Penny It's right there.
__Sheldon Where is the passenger side mirror?
__Penny In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?
__Sheldon Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I'm going to have to start again.
__Leonard I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.
__Howard I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
__Raj I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.
__Leonard You know what's a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.
__Howard It was my Uncle Murray's funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara's house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.
__Raj One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don't come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.
__Leonard People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how's it goin'?
__Howard To this day, I can't look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.
__Sheldon Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast. What's that?
__Penny Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
__Sheldon That can't be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.
__Penny No. The light has been on since I bought the car.
__Sheldon All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
__Penny It's not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.
__Sheldon Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise's check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.
__Penny Oh, god, I'm gonna lose the arm.
__Sheldon Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?
__Penny What?
__Penny It's not soup, it's courage.
__Sheldon No, it isn't. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.
__Penny How did you see it? You said you wouldn't look.
__Sheldon Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.
__Leonard No. That was the last pudding cup.
__Howard No! What about Slim Jims?
__Leonard That's what he used to eat his pudding, remember?
__Raj Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.
__Howard Wait. Wait, wait. So you're saying we're out of food?
__Leonard The only thing in here are blue ice packs.
__Raj I know they're poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.
__Leonard Oh, god, I am so hungry.
__Howard Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.
__Leonard Okay.
__Penny I dislocated my shoulder.
__Sheldon All right. And how did the accident occur?
__Penny You ready know that.
__Sheldon Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Kidney disease?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Migraines?
__Penny Getting one.
__Sheldon Are you currently pregnant?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.
__Penny Change migraine to yes.
__Sheldon When was your last menstrual period?
__Penny Oh, next question.
__Sheldon I'll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.
__Penny Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?
__Sheldon Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
__Penny Ass.
__Sheldon Possible Tourette's. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don't know, comforting?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. There, there. Everything's going to be fine. Sheldon's here.
__Penny Thanks. That's much better.
__Leonard Will you shut up? We're all hungry.
__Howard Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.
__Leonard What kind of score are we looking at?
__Howard Hot dogs, buns, s'mores, I mean, it's a freaking 7-11.
__Leonard All right, everyone grab flashlights.
__Howard Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.
__Leonard Quick, get forks.
__Howard You don't need forks. It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands.
__Raj He's right.
__Leonard I feel like we're forgetting something important.
__Raj Me, too. But what?
__Howard Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
__Leonard and Raj together Yes! Yes!
__Penny Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I'd say that.
__Sheldon Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
__Penny You know, people think you're this weird robot man who's so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it's like that movie Wall-E at the end. You're so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.
__Sheldon That's a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.
__Penny Sing “Soft Kitty” to me.
__Sheldon “Soft Kitty” is for when you're sick. You're not sick.
__Penny Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
__Sheldon Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
__Penny Wait, wait. Let's sing it as a round. I'll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… See that's where you come in. I'll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… I've got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty…  little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
__Howard That's still not funny.
__Raj That's still not funny.
__Howard And she was my second cousin.
__Raj And she was my second cousin.
__Howard You're a real douche.
__Raj Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
__Bernadette I don't really get it.
__Howard Well, see, it took two years for the snail to…  not important.
__Bernadette Can I ask you a question?
__Howard Sure.
__Bernadette Where do you think this is going?
__Howard To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.
__Bernadette You're so funny. You're like a stand-up comedian.
__Howard A Jewish stand-up comedian, that'd be new.
__Bernadette Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.
__Howard No, I was just… never mind.
__Bernadette Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means.
__Howard We do?
__Bernadette Sex.
__Howard You're kidding.
__Bernadette But I need to know whether you're looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
__Howard Okay, just to be clear, there's only one correct answer, right? It's not like chicken or fish on an airplane?
__Bernadette Maybe you need to think about it a little.
__Howard You know, it's not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.
__Bernadette Call me when you figure it out.
__Howard Three dates means sex? Who knew?
__Penny Why are you back from your date so early?
__Howard In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.
__Penny What exactly does that mean?
__Leonard He struck out.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Actually, I've never had three dates with the same woman.
__Howard Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?
__Leonard No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.
__Sheldon I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?
__Leonard The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
__Sheldon I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?
__Leonard Never mind, what's your announcement?
__Sheldon Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…
__Kripke Hey, Cooper, I hear you're going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.
__Sheldon Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.
__Kripke My pweasure.
__Sheldon My thank you was not sincere.
__Kripke But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don't answer, it's wetowical.
__Sheldon Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I'm sorry you had to hear that.
__Leonard Are you really going to be on NPR?
__Sheldon Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It's pledge week and they're trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.
__Leonard Very cool, congratulations.
__Sheldon Thank you. My mother is very excited. She's convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.
__Raj I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, “Fever 104, आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” “Fever 104, home of the really good current music.” It's much catchier in Hindi.
__Howard Excuse me, I have a master's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.
__Leonard You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don't have to do it.
__Raj In fact, it's better if you don't, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.
__Penny Hi, guys.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny Yo, Raj, talk to me. I'm sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven't you called Bernadette?
__Howard Did she say something?
__Penny Yeah, she said she hasn't heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?
__Howard I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I'm not sure she's my type.
__Penny She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?
__Howard Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.
__Penny Different how?
__Howard Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.
__Penny Are you high?
__Leonard You'd have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
__Howard Okay, now you're just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.
__Penny Howard, you're going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you're holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?
__Howard Hey, just because you settled doesn't mean I have to.
__Leonard Excuse me, I'm sitting here.
__Penny Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.
__Leonard Again, I'm right here.
__Penny My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.
__Leonard I am here, right? You see me.
__Howard Hey, I'm interested in what's inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?  Yes, you're delicious caramel, too.
__Penny All right, you know what, I will tell you why it's wrong…
__Sheldon Excuse me, may I interject?
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
__Howard Thank you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.
__Kripke Oh, this is going to be a wiot.
__ Scene switches to Sheldon's office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.
__ Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.
__Sheldon My pleasure, Ira.
__Ira Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?
__Sheldon Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has,  as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles,  a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.
__Ira Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.
__Sheldon No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.
__ Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.
__ A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!
__Katee Sackhoff Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.
__Howard Come on, Katee, don't make it sound so cheap.
__Katee I'm sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.
__Howard Thank you. So, shall we get started?
__Katee Sure. But can I ask you a question first?
__Howard You want to play Cylon and colonist?
__Katee No. I want to know why you're playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.
__Howard You mean, Bernadette?
__Katee No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She's a wonderful girl and she really likes you.
__Howard I know, but she's not you.
__Katee I'm not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.
__Howard Really? Tall?
__Katee Six-four.
__Howard Ouch.
__Katee The point is, you've got a wonderful girl in your life, and you're ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Howard! What are you doing in there?
__Howard I'm taking a bath!
__Howard's Mother Howard' I hope that's all you're doing! We share that tub!
__Howard Don't remind me!  Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go.
__Sheldon I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I'm doing?
__Leonard Come on, it wasn't that bad.
__Sheldon What do you want?
__Raj We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.
__Leonard Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
__Sheldon It wasn't funny.
__Raj I thought it was funny.
__Leonard Raj.
__Raj You laughed.
__Sheldon Did you laugh?
__Leonard I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.
__Sheldon I refuse to sink to his level.
__Raj You can't sink. With all that helium in you, you're lucky you don't float away.
__Leonard Are you really admitting defeat?
__Sheldon I never admit defeat.
__Leonard Good.
__Sheldon However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.
__Leonard What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
__Raj I don't think that's possible, dude.
__Leonard You're not helping.
__Raj I didn't come to help, I came to mock.
__Leonard Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
__Sheldon Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.
__Leonard No, no.
__Sheldon It's a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that'd be untraceable in an autopsy.
__Leonard Okay, uh, that's the spirit, but, um, let's dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.
__Sheldon Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He'll sit down, it'll sound like he's flatulent, even though he's not.
__Leonard Let's keep thinking.
__Howard Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She's working today, right?
__Penny Yes, but I don't think she wants to see you.
__Howard Why not?
__Penny Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I've kind of been talkin' some smack about ya.
__Bernadette Hello, Howard.
__Howard Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.
__Bernadette I can't now, I'm working.
__Howard This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?
__Bernadette Is this more comedy that I don't understand?
__Howard No. I'm serious. I'm never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.
__Bernadette So, this isn't a joke?
__Howard No.
__Bernadette Then you're insane.
__Howard I prefer to think of myself as quirky.
__Bernadette Howard, we've only been on three dates. We haven't even had sex yet.
__Howard Fair enough. When's your break?
__Bernadette Wow.
__Howard Don't you just hate when this happens?
__Penny Wow.
__Raj What's this?
__Sheldon Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.
__Raj Foamy vengeance.
__Sheldon Yes, exactly.
__Leonard This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke's office?
__Sheldon Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke's lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.
__Raj Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.
__Sheldon You flatter me, sir.
__Leonard Let me guess, motion sensors?
__Sheldon The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.
__Leonard I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.
__Sheldon It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.
__Raj Here comes Kripke!
__Leonard Who is that with him?
__Raj I believe that's the president of the university.
__Leonard And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
__Sheldon There is no abort.
__Raj Well, how could you not put in an abort?
__Sheldon I made a boo-boo, all right?
__Kripke I think the board will weally appweciate how well we're using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma…
__Raj Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
__Leonard At least they don't know it was you.
__Sheldon Sheldon (on Kripke's computer in the lab): Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you'd like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.
__Raj Well, I'm going back to India. What's your plan?
__Bernadette Oh, thanks.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Howard Testing. Check. Check two.
__Bernadette Oh, now what?
__Penny You want me to throw him out?
__Bernadette No, that's okay.
__Penny Are you sure? He's small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.
__Howard I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I've done wrong.  Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that's just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I'll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette…
__Penny Oh, I am so sorry.
__Bernadette Are you kidding? That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me.
__Howard …Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!
__Sheldon Leonard, she's doing it again.
__Leonard I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
__Sheldon No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
__Penny You want me to put it back?
__Sheldon Leonard.
__Leonard It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
__Howard What's up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Howard Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.
__Leonard Yeah. Hey.
__Howard Bernadette, say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.
__Bernadette I don't think I can. I don't have Howard's street cred.
__Howard I hope it's all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.
__Leonard Sure. The more, the merrier.
__Sheldon Wait, no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.
__Leonard Sheldon…
__Sheldon Don't Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.
__Sheldon Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?
__Leonard Relax, it'll be fine, sit down, you guys.
__Everyone NO!
__Bernadette What?
__Penny Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.
__Bernadette Why not?
__Leonard That's where Sheldon sits.
__Bernadette He can't sit somewhere else?
__Penny Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.
__Sheldon Perhaps there's hope for you after all.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?
__Bernadette Where'd you get them?
__Bernadette I've been meaning to go over there.
__Penny Oh, great selection, great prices.
__Sheldon My mother was right. Hell is real.
__Howard Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.
__Penny Womenfolk?
__Howard Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?
__Penny Just eat your dinner.
__Bernadette Don't take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour.
__Penny Yeah, well, I don't think it's very funny.
__Bernadette Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.
__Penny Howard, never let her go.
__Bernadette So, Leonard, Howard says you're working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.
__Leonard I am. Are you interested in physics?
__Bernadette Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn't gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.
__Bernadette That's amazing.
__Bernadette Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
__Leonard Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?
__Bernadette Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.
__Sheldon Howard?
__Howard Yeah?
__Sheldon Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
__Howard What?
__Sheldon Bazinga. I don't care.
__Sheldon That's not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
__Raj And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.
__Sheldon Just need a little more practice.
__Raj What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?
__Sheldon It's not about shoes, is it? I don't think I could go through that again.
__Penny It's not about shoes.
__Sheldon Then speak.
__Sheldon All right.  Go away. I agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.
__Penny Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here's the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?
__Sheldon A little physics? There's no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.
__Penny Yeah, okay, cool. I don't need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.
__Sheldon Why can't Leonard teach you?
__Penny ‘Cause I want to surprise him.
__Sheldon Can't you surprise him in some other way? For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.
__Penny Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.
__Sheldon Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.
__Penny You're sitting here playing video games all day.
__Sheldon Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?
__Penny Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
__Sheldon The one with the frogs.
__Penny Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Penny, I don't think so.
__Penny Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.
__Sheldon Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.
__Penny Great! It's a little insulting, but great. I'll be KoKo.
__Sheldon Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.
__Bernadette Who are all those people?
__Howard Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.
__Bernadette Hi.
__Leonard Hey, look, it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.
__Howard Thought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
__Bernadette He doesn't mean salt mines. He means where he works.
__Leonard Yeah, no, I got it.
__Bernadette So, how's your experiment going?
__Leonard Ah, terrific. We're getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.
__Bernadette Boy, I'd love to see that.
__Leonard You're welcome to come.
__Bernadette Really? Oh, that'd be great. How exciting is that?
__Howard Like Hanukkah in July.
__Bernadette Do they have that?
__Howard No.
__Bernadette Oh. You got me again. This isn't non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.
__Howard Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?
__Bernadette Sure.
__Howard Thanks, honey.  All right, what is your deal?
__Leonard Excuse me?
__Howard Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
__Leonard Yeah? So?
__Howard Wow! You really are a piece of work. It's not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Howard Don't play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
__Leonard Has it ever worked?
__Howard Not so far, but that's not the point!
__Leonard Howard, relax, I'm not interested in your girlfriend.
__Howard I hope not, because you don't want to mess with me. I'm crazy.
__Leonard I believe you.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I've extended a friendly casual greeting.
__Penny Ready to get started?
__Sheldon One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where's your notebook?
__Penny Um, I don't have one.
__Sheldon How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
__Penny I have to take notes?
__Sheldon How else are you gonna study for the tests?
__Penny There's gonna be a test?
__Sheldon Tests. Here. It's college-ruled. I hope that's not too intimidating.
__Penny Thank you.
__Sheldon You're welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.
__Penny Ancient Greece?
__Sheldon Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you've finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?
__Penny Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?
__Sheldon This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we're going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
__Penny Twenty six hundred years?
__Penny I have to go to the bathroom.
__Sheldon Can't you hold it?
__Penny Not for twenty six hundred years.
__Sheldon Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.
__Howard Huh?
__Bernadette It unhooks in the front.
__Howard Oh, that explains a lot.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Howard, I'm home!
__Howard Of course.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.
__Howard That's great, Ma!
__Bernadette I guess I should go.
__Howard No, no, don't move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?
__Howard's Mother Howard' Lamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket.
__Howard Please? I got a real hankering.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Oh, I can't say no to my little tushy face. I'll be back soon.
__Howard Thanks, Ma.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?
__Howard Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!
__Howard's Mother Howard' You're right! When you're right, you're right! What if they're out of the Le Seur?
__Howard Then get the regular!
__Howard's Mother Howard' All right! You don't have to yell!
__Howard Sorry about that.
__Bernadette Let me just put that on vibrate.
__Howard I'm already on vibrate.
__Bernadette You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?
__Howard Uh, what do you mean?
__Bernadette He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
__Howard Really? He said that?
__Bernadette You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?
__Howard Me? No. I may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate to be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.
__Bernadette Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
__Howard I didn't say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission.  Come on, I don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.
__Penny Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?
__Sheldon No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don't write that down!
__Penny Sorry.
__Sheldon Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?
__Penny I don't know.
__Sheldon How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
__Penny Hey! You don't have to be so mean!
__Sheldon I'm sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
__Penny No, you just suck at teaching.
__Sheldon Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?
__Sheldon All right. It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
__Penny Not that far back!
__Sheldon Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
__Penny I don't know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
__Sheldon Greece.
__Penny Damn it!
__Sheldon There's no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?
__Penny Squared?
__Sheldon No.
__Penny Aristotle?
__Sheldon No.
__Penny Five?
__Sheldon Oh!
__Penny Then I don't know.
__Sheldon Why are you crying?
__Penny Because I'm stupid!
__Sheldon That's no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.
__Penny Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?
__Sheldon All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
__Penny Really? That's it? Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.
__Sheldon It's not. That's why Leonard does it.
__Penny Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?
__Sheldon A good question.
__Penny Thank you.
__Sheldon And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?
__Penny Oh, balls.
__Sheldon It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
__Leonard What did I do now?
__Howard I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.
__Leonard What?
__Howard We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.
__Leonard You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
__Howard Yeah, but that's not what you tell her.
__Leonard What was I supposed to tell her?
__Howard I don't know, something that doesn't make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.
__Leonard And what would that be?
__Howard Come on, do I have to think of everything?
__Bernadette Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi.
__Howard Hi.
__Bernadette What are you doing here?
__Howard Same thing you're doing here. I came to see Leonard's experiment.
__Bernadette No, you didn't. You said Leonard's experiment was stupid.
__Leonard You told her my experiment was stupid?
__Howard I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let's not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.
__Leonard Should I, um, leave you two alone?
__Bernadette No, Leonard, you should hear this.
__Leonard Okay, good, 'cause I wasn't really gonna go.
__Howard Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I'm not.
__Leonard We're shocked.
__Howard Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.
__Leonard Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.
__Howard But I now realize how foolish that is.
__Leonard He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
__Howard It was a full turtleneck. Why aren't you helping me?
__Leonard I don't know. Maybe because I'm crazy?
__Howard Bernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance.
__Leonard It's up to you. He didn't call your experiment stupid.
__Bernadette Come here, tushy face.
__Leonard Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.
__Leonard I'm glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren't that interested in what I do.
__Penny Actually, that's not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I've been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That's it. That's all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.
__Sheldon Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.
__Leonard Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.
__Penny You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
__Sheldon No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.
__Leonard When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
__Sheldon Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.
__Leonard Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard We didn't have a tree when I was growing up.
__Penny Really? Why not?
__Leonard Mmm, in my family, holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
__Penny Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?
__Leonard Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.
__Penny Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.
__Penny So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.
__Sheldon I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
__Penny What is it?
__Sheldon You're kidding, right? It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
__Penny Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.
__Sheldon Wait, excuse me, but it's much more Christmassy than anything you've put on the tree.
__Leonard Here we go.
__Sheldon December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.
__Leonard Merry Newton-mas, everyone.
__Sheldon I sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why.
__Penny No, it's fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.
__Sheldon No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
__Leonard No, he doesn't.
__Sheldon I understand. You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
__Leonard Yeah, you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.
__Sheldon Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she'll talk some sense into you.
__Penny What? Your… your mother's coming? When?
__Leonard Tomorrow.
__Penny When were you going to tell me?
__Leonard Um, tomorrow?
__Penny Why were you keeping this a secret?
__Leonard Well, I just, I thought…
__Sheldon If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won't approve of you as his mate.
__Penny Why wouldn't she approve of me? I'm adorable.
__Leonard You are, it's just…
__Sheldon If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.
__Penny Hey, it's a big menu. There's two pages just for desserts.
__Leonard I know. And those specials, they change every day.
__Penny Okay, you know what? It's lame when I say it, it's just ridiculous when you pile on.
__Leonard Okay, sorry.
__Penny So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
__Leonard Um…
__Penny You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?
__Leonard Um…
__Penny Why not?
__Leonard Um…
__Sheldon Leonard, I'm no expert on meditation, but if you're trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.
__Sheldon No trouble at all.
__Beverley Yes, dear. Mommy's proud. I've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.
__Sheldon August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
__Beverley Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?
__Sheldon You did.
__Beverley I don't really like flowers.
__Sheldon Neither do I, but it's the social convention.
__Beverley It is, isn't it?
__Leonard Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?
__Beverley Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.
__Leonard No, I heard that.
__Beverley Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?
__Leonard I just don't understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
__Beverley Well, I would assume it's because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.
__Sheldon It's what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
__Beverley Yes, but we are on the subject, so I'm obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?
__Leonard Fine, Mom. How are you?
__Beverley Mmm, menopausal.
__Leonard Now I'm less fine.
__Beverley Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?
__Leonard No. Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?
__Sheldon My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
__Beverley She's a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.
__Leonard You must be very happy.
__Beverley Why? I'm not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?
__Sheldon Well, I'm not sure about interesting, but…
__Leonard Not the time, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
__Beverley It's all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard's not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.
__Sheldon Isn't she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.
__Howard What? No.
__Beverley Why not?
__Howard Because we don't have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
__Beverley I see.
__Howard No, really. I have a girlfriend now.
__Beverley And where is she this evening?
__Howard She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.
__Beverley I see. Her grandmother died.
__Howard Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.
__Leonard I don't know what you're talking about.
__Leonard All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
__Howard Her name is Bernadette, she's working as a waitress, but she's going to school to be a microbiologist.
__Beverley Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you're hurting your partner.
__Howard Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
__Penny Hi. Sorry I'm late.
__Leonard Oh, glad you're here, uh, sit down, I'll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.
__Beverley Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?
__Penny Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas, so I'm going to say no.
__Beverley Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I'm divorcing yours.
__Leonard What?
__Beverley Yes. He was cheating on me.
__Leonard No!
__Beverley Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear.
__Penny No, it sounded like a compliment.
__Leonard When did this happen?
__Sheldon September 22nd.
__Beverley Oh, yes, that's right. The weekend after Leonard's dog died.
__Leonard Mitzy's dead?
__Sheldon She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?
__Leonard I don't believe this. Why am I the last to know?
__Beverley Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who's getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?
__Leonard You're right. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, I'm way out of line!
__Beverley So, Penny, what's new in your life?
__Penny Nothing. Not a damn thing.
__Penny Oh, it's not a problem.
__Beverley I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.
__Penny No, you do not.
__Beverley Your check engine light is on.
__Penny Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.
__Beverley Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that's not subjected to regular maintenance.
__Penny Come on, I mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over?
__Beverley Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that's the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.
__Penny Sure, sure.
__Beverley Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven't had intercourse with him in eight years.
__Penny Eight years?
__Beverley Oh, that's nothing. I've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.
__Penny Yikes. What's so funny?
__Beverley That's exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.
__Penny You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
__Beverley Oh, I don't drink.
__Penny I do, I'll teach you.
__Leonard What is it?
__ I made tea.
__Leonard I don't want tea.
__Sheldon I didn't make tea for you. This is my tea.
__Leonard Then why are you telling me?
__Sheldon It's a conversation starter.
__Leonard That's a lousy conversation starter.
__Leonard What do you want, Sheldon?
__Sheldon What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
__Leonard I want that too. Why are you here?
__Sheldon To comfort you, of course. No, that's not going to work at all, I'll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you're experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.
__Leonard Thank you, that's very comforting.
__Sheldon That's not the comforting part.
__Leonard It's not?
__Sheldon No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you're feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.
__Leonard You're right, I do feel better.
__Sheldon Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.
__Leonard You're my surrogate family?
__Sheldon If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either. Good night.
__Beverley Yikes.
__Penny I've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
__Beverley I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.
__Penny As long as you don't feel it running down your pants, you're fine.
__Beverley Oh, that is fascinating. I'm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I'm seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?
__Penny Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.
__Beverley Yes. If a little is good, more must be better.
__Penny Hey, Bev, guess what?
__Penny I'm sleeping with your son.
__Beverley Really? Which one?
__Penny The one from whom I live across the hall from.
__Beverley Well, that's convenient. How did his penis turn out?
__Penny Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis.
__Beverley Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy's penis?
__Penny Actually, I've only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.
__Beverley Really? Well, that means he's either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn't care enough about his mother to tell her he's in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted.
__Penny Well, let's go find out who.
__Beverley You go get a taxi. I'm gonna slip my business card into that busboy's back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.
__Beverley Sonny boy!
__Penny Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
__Leonard What the hell is going on?
__Penny You're in trouble.
__Beverley Why didn't you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?
__Penny Yeah, not bad, not bad.
__Leonard Are you guys drunk?
__Beverley Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?
__Penny Oh, thank you.
__Beverley You're welcome. Is it because she's uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?
__Penny What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
__Leonard How come you didn't tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn't tell me you had surgery? How come you didn't tell me my dog died?
__Beverley Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.
__Leonard I do.
__Beverley There. It's late. Now, go to bed. I'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.
__Penny That's the Del Taco.
__Sheldon Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
__Beverley Speaking of warm feelings, come here.  No, I'd rather have the busboy.
__Sheldon You're very welcome.
__Leonard Once again, I'm driving. I'm right here.
__Beverley Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you'll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.
__Sheldon I don't blame you. You were intoxicated.
__Beverley Thank you.
__Sheldon I blame Penny.
__Penny I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.
__Leonard Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?
__Beverley I think it's best that you not know.
__Sheldon Agreed.
__Penny Agreed.
__Leonard What the hell, agreed.
__Beverley And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.
__Beverley You're welcome. She doesn't have much in the way of career prospects, don't make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.
__Leonard Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don't communicate with me enough?
__Beverley Yes, dear.
__Leonard I'm over it.
__Penny Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la.
__Howard Yes, actual women are the best.
__Sheldon I don't understand. What other kind of women are there?
__Leonard Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?
__Howard No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I'm a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.
__Leonard What are you trying to tell me, Howard?
__Howard There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don't want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.
__Leonard Don't worry. We're planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
__Raj Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
__Leonard Got it.
__Howard Seen it.
__Sheldon Detailed analysis posted online.
__Raj Well, then what are we going to do tonight?
__Leonard Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.
__Howard Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.
__Leonard How did we get actual women?
__Raj Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?
__Sheldon It is great, isn't it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.
__Raj We do?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. I just discovered I don't have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
__Raj I don't want to do that.
__Sheldon All right. Well, I'm going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
__Raj What about me?
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s.
__Sheldon The zoot suit riots.
__Raj Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don't we just go to the galleria and walk around?
__Sheldon I don't need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
__Raj No. We would just walk around and see what's what.
__Sheldon That's a semantically null sentence.
__Raj Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.
__Sheldon Well, that's certainly amusing, but I have no interest.
__Raj Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let's go outside. Outside is good.
__Sheldon If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?
__Raj I don't know, it's a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I'm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
__Sheldon Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.
__Raj Oh, boy.
__Sheldon One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott's mathematical fantasy, Flatland.
__Raj I don't want to go to Flatland.
__Sheldon You're only saying that because you haven't been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
__Raj Oy.
__Sheldon Is that you, Raj? I don't recognize your edge.
__Raj Sheldon, I'm begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don't want to go alone.
__Sheldon Well, you're in luck, there's a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there's a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.
__Raj What?
__Sheldon Tell her you're a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.
__Bernadette Oh, yeah, I'm starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.
__Howard Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?
__Penny That you'd be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you'd get to second base?
__Bernadette Oh, we're way past second base. Right, Howard?
__Howard Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.
__Bernadette How's your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?
__Leonard Great. How come?
__Penny Well, promise you won't make fun of me.
__Leonard Of course, I would never make fun of you.
__Penny Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I'm going to get a national commercial.
__Leonard Seriously? You're getting career advice from a psychic?
__Howard Good job not making fun of her.
__Penny She's not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.
__Leonard Oh, gee, why didn't you say so? They don't let just anyone have a Web site.
__Penny Why are you being such a jerk?
__Leonard You're surprised? Your psychic didn't tell you I was going to be a jerk?
__Penny Ha-ha, bite me.
__Leonard Come on, Penny.
__Bernadette I'm sliding into third.
__Sheldon Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
__Raj Did you really have to bring it in with you?
__Sheldon What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
__Raj Come on, let's get a drink.
__Sheldon I don't drink.
__Raj Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I'll have a screwdriver, please. Don't be chintzy with the screw.
__Sheldon I would like a root beer float.
__Raj Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.
__Sheldon They don't? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.
__Raj He'll have a Shirley Temple.
__Raj Okay, let's check out the females.
__Sheldon All right. There's a female.
__Raj That's Professor Wilkinson's wife, she's like 80 years old.
__Sheldon But she's female. Isn't that the game?
__Raj No. I'm looking for a hookup.
__Sheldon Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
__Sheldon Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
__Raj You help me run my game.
__Sheldon Okay. What is your game?
__Sheldon When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.
__Sheldon It's a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
__Girl You're very funny. I'm Abby.
__Sheldon I'm Sheldon. How do you do?
__Raj How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
__Abby Hi, Raj. Where are you from?
__Raj The mysterious subcontinent of India.
__Abby Ooh, India.
__Raj You know India?
__Abby I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
__Raj Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.
__Sheldon I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I'm sorry.
__Abby Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.
__Martha Hi.
__Raj Hello.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Martha Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?
__Sheldon In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.
__Martha Oh, that is so awesome.
__Sheldon Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
__Howard Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?
__Penny Oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.
__Leonard I'm sorry, but facts are facts.
__Penny Right, and if you can't understand it, it's not a fact.
__Leonard No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.
__Penny Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
__Leonard You're welcome. How's your fish?
__Penny Amazing. Would you like to try some?
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Penny Well, the fact is, you can't.
__Leonard Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you're both scientists. Help me out here.
__Howard What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple's argument?
__Bernadette No, thank you.
__Howard Sorry.
__Leonard Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
__Penny Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
__Waiter How is everything tonight?
__Bernadette Really uncomfortable.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Howard Had a great night last night. I don't like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.
__Leonard What the hell is eighth base?
__Howard Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How'd things go with Penny?
__Leonard Oh, couldn't be better.
__Howard Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
__Leonard It's not just Cylons. Superman's next.
__Howard All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don't have a high-powered weapon.
__Leonard How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
__Howard Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.
__Leonard And that didn't bother you?
__Howard Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
__Leonard What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don't whenever I'm with Penny?
__Howard Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she's with you.
__Leonard Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.
__Howard Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the
__ little triple intersection is your ideal mate. Odds are she's a short physicist with low self-esteem who lives in a government research facility in China.
__ What's your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can't do that, Howard.
__Howard I respect that. (Takes Leonard's hand, draws a dot on it.)
__Leonard What is that?
__Howard Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.
__Raj What was that?
__Sheldon It means come in. It's taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.
__Raj जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That's Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?
__Sheldon I don't say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you've gone insane.
__Raj I don't get it. You had a great time.
__Sheldon Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That's done, I've moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I'm not going to learn Finnish again.
__Raj Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she'll only come over if she can bring Martha.
__Sheldon Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.
__Raj My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
__Sheldon Oh, my. I've admired these for years.
__Raj So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
__Sheldon Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
__Raj You can't wear the hands on the date.
__Sheldon Hulk sad.
__Penny Wow, that's all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?
__Leonard No, I'm sorry. I really am. It's not right to mock what a person believes in.
__Penny Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it's all about?
__Leonard Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
__Penny I would not.
__Leonard Okay, let's go see your psychic.
__Penny Really?
__Leonard Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.
__Penny You saying I don't have an open mind?
__Leonard No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.
__Penny You know, I believe in ghosts, too.
__Leonard Great.
__Penny And astrology.
__Leonard I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.
__Penny Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work.
__Leonard Really, that's the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?
__Penny Oh, voodoo's real. You don't want to mess with voodoo.
__Sheldon You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that's going to completely change my visits there. Well, it's late.
__Martha Uh-huh.
__Sheldon Time for bed.
__Martha Okay.
__Sheldon Good night, puny human!
__Sheldon Yes?
__Martha Listen, they're kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.
__Sheldon Well, I suppose. Come in. I'll sleep in Leonard's room. Good night.
__Raj Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.
__Howard A little jealous, are we?
__Raj No, I'm not jealous. All right, I'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid. Now, can we order?
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.
__Leonard So what? It's the same food.
__Sheldon Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso's Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It's now under chicken.
__Raj So?
__Sheldon Yes, General Tso.
__Raj Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?
__Sheldon So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?
__Leonard It's obviously a typo.
__Sheldon Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.
__Raj No, no, no, no, I think it just means it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.
__Howard It doesn't mean any of that! It's a typo.
__Leonard You know what? Let's just get a pizza.
__Sheldon Good idea. We'll go to Corleone's.
__Howard Sure, no mobsters there.
__Leonard And why is that?
__Sheldon It was listed under seafood.
__Leonard What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
__Sheldon Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?
__Leonard What the…?
__Sheldon The TV is gone.
__Leonard So are our laptops.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard We like games.
__Sheldon Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9 Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman.
__Policeman Assorted video games.
__Sheldon When does the CSI team get here?
__Policeman What?
__Sheldon In anticipation of their arrival, I've bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.
__Leonard What about me?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Leonard. It's too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.
__Leonard Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
__Policeman I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.
__Sheldon I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.
__Policeman We're done here. Call this number, and we'll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, that's the end of your inquiry?
__Policeman Do you have any more information that might be relevant?
__Sheldon Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.
__Leonard How is that going to help them?
__Sheldon Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.
__Policeman Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.
__Leonard What are we supposed to do now?
__Sheldon The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
__Leonard Does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect?
__Sheldon Oh, how I wish I could.
__ right into the robbers.
__ Hey, there's no reason for you to be scared.
__Penny I'm not scared. I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.
__Sheldon Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.
__Leonard Hand me the bat.
__Sheldon We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?
__Penny It won't happen again, what's up?
__Sheldon Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
__Leonard We're fine, Sheldon.
__Sheldon All right, then. Good night.
__Penny Good night. That was weird, even for him.
__Leonard Mm-hmm.
__Sheldon Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.
__Penny Who is it?
__Sheldon Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
__Penny Yes?
__Sheldon May I come in?
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon I see you're drinking wine.
__Leonard Yes, we are. And we're about to go to bed.
__Sheldon Uh-huh.
__Penny Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?
__Sheldon Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don't think the two of you'd be comfortable on the couch.
__Leonard What do you want?
__Sheldon It's not what I want, it's what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.
__Leonard But you don't like other people.
__Sheldon I do tonight. It's scary over there.
__Leonard It's getting scary here, too.
__Leonard Did we win? Can we go to bed?
__Sheldon Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?
__Leonard He's right, Penny. It's all there.
__Penny Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you're feeling insecure, but we've really got to go to sleep.
__Sheldon All right. I'll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
__Leonard Great. Good night.
__Penny Wait, wait, what's 0400?
__Leonard 4am.
__Penny That's, like, in 45 minutes.
__Leonard Just keep walking.
__Woman on TV It's quiet out there.
__Man on TV Maybe a little too quiet.
__Woman on TV Where are you going?
__Man on TV Just gonna take a look around outside.
__Sheldon Bad idea.
__Woman on TV No, Jim, don't open the door!
__Sheldon Listen to her, Jim.
__Man on TV Don't worry, there's no one out here. (Sound of woman screaming. Sheldon nods, and turns off TV. Walks down to Leonard's room.)
__Leonard Who is it?
__Sheldon What if they cut the power?
__Raj There's a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
__Raj There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
__Sheldon What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?
__Leonard I'll send them a basket of muffins.
__Howard Now, inside, we've got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.
__Leonard Where did you get all this stuff?
__Howard I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.
__Leonard He just gave it to you?
__Howard I'm sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn't all that good.
__Leonard Sorry, let me help you.
__Sheldon Wonderful security system if we're attacked by a school of tuna.
__Howard Don't worry, the net's going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.
__Sheldon Better.
__Penny Oh, my…
__Leonard God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?
__Sheldon I heard a noise.
__Leonard It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
__Sheldon Why would you knock over a lamp?
__Leonard We were going to have…
__Penny He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.
__Sheldon Oh! No, she's right, I don't need to know what you were doing. Carry on.
__Leonard What are you doing? Use the door.
__Sheldon Good thinking. Perhaps I'll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
__Leonard Great, you do that.
__Sheldon Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
__Leonard I'm lactose intolerant.
__Sheldon And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?
__Penny No, thanks.
__Sheldon Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.
__Leonard Sorry about that.
__Penny Ugh, what can you do? Here. (From outside there is the sound of the net falling and computer voice saying “Intruder alert.” Then Sheldon screaming. They run out to find Sheldon convulsing under the net.)
__Leonard Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
__Penny Sheldon, are you okay?
__Sheldon I'm fine. Although I'm no longer the master of my own bladder.
__Leonard Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
__Sheldon Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I'm leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that's overreacting.
__Penny Come on, Sheldon, you can't move. Don't you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?
__Sheldon Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that's more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.
__Penny Is he quitting his job at the university?
__Leonard Oh, no, he's going to telecommute. Everybody's really excited about it.
__Sheldon All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan'l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?
__Penny Born and raised.
__Leonard Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?
__Sheldon I sense you're making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.
__Howard Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That's part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.
__Sheldon I am moving on. I'm going to be a Bozite.
__Leonard They call themselves Bozites?
__Sheldon They should. It's one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
__Penny Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm going to miss you.
__Sheldon Please, Penny, as you know, I'm not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.
__Sheldon on laptop screen Greetings. As you know, I'm not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.
__Penny Sheldon, that's so…
__Sheldon You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn't Bozeman.
__Howard How the hell do I know who's the friend and who's the acquaintance?
__Man Help you with your bags, sir?
__Sheldon Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town's Chamber of Commerce.  Wait! Wait! Excuse me!  One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.
__Sheldon Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
__Sheldon I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
__Penny Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You've been up all night?
__Sheldon Is it morning?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Then I've been up all night.
__Penny And you're stuck?
__Sheldon Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
__Penny Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help you till I've had my coffee.
__Leonard Penny, I told you if you don't put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.
__Penny What is he doing now?
__Leonard Mmm, he's either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
__Sheldon Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you're going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.
__Leonard Aye, aye, Captain.
__Sheldon I can't see it! It just won't coalesce.
__Leonard Maybe you need a fresh start.
__Sheldon You're right.  It's a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard How long has he been stuck?
__Leonard Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
__Sheldon Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
__Howard Have you tried rebooting him?
__Leonard No, I think it's a firmware problem.
__Raj Hey, it's Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who's up for getting down?
__Howard Oh, that's perfect. Bernadette's been hocking me to take her roller skating.
__Leonard I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
__Howard What could be better? We're in.
__Raj Great. It's not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
__Howard You can come with us.
__Raj No, it's okay. I don't have to go. I'm happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I'm a walking brown Yelp.com.
__Sheldon Structure, constant structure. One atom…
__Howard Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?
__Leonard Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
__Howard I thought I smelled popcorn.
__Sheldon Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it's always hexagonal…
__Leonard I haven't seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
__Raj Hey, those are my lima beans!
__Sheldon Not lima beans, carbon atoms.
__Leonard Here, you want my peas?
__Sheldon Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.
__Howard Want my corn?
__Sheldon Don't be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
__Leonard So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?
__Howard Good. P.F. Chang's? My mom has coupons.
__Leonard Great. Your mom's not coming, right?
__Howard Not this time, I promise.
__Raj Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I'm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
__Sheldon The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
__Raj Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
__Penny Not recently.
__Bernadette I don't know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.
__Penny For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
__Leonard You had some nice moves out there, Howard.
__Howard Thanks. You, too.
__Leonard Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
__Howard Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
__Bernadette When Howard tried to do the splits…
__Penny Shh.
__Leonard Sorry. I'm moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
__Penny Oh, poor baby.
__Penny Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon.
__Leonard Oh, my God! Are you…
__Sheldon Good Lord! You're ruining everything!
__Penny Oh, damn.
__Leonard Are you okay?
__Penny Do I look okay?
__Leonard Don't bark at me. I fell, too.
__Penny Oh, you've been falling all night. You're used to it.
__Sheldon The same thing I've been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
__Bernadette With marbles?
__Sheldon Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn't I?
__Bernadette Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
__Sheldon I don't know, two, three days. Not important. I don't need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.
__Penny Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
__Bernadette Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don't get enough REM sleep?
__Sheldon They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
__Bernadette Which leads to…?
__Sheldon Impaired cognitive function.
__Bernadette Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.
__Sheldon But I don't want to go to bed.
__Bernadette I'm going to count to three. One…
__Sheldon Oh, all right.
__Leonard That was amazing how you handled him.
__Bernadette I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
__Leonard It's not me, it's my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.
__Penny Well, it creeps me out.
__Leonard Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.
__Penny Just answer the phone.
__Leonard Hello. Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he's my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I'll be right there.
__Penny What happened?
__Leonard Sheldon's escaped and is terrorizing the village.
__Penny Okay. Have fun.
__Security Guard Ball pit.
__Leonard Thanks for not calling the cops.
__Security Guard Oh, hey, it's no big deal. My sister's got a kid who's special.
__Leonard Yeah, well, he's extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?
__Sheldon Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn't visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
__Leonard Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?
__Leonard No, I don't think so. We need to go home now.
__Sheldon But I'm still working.
__Leonard If you don't come out of there, I'm going to have to drag you out.
__Sheldon You can try, but you'll never catch me.
__Leonard For God's sakes. Sheldon, come here!
__Sheldon Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.
__Leonard What! What, what, what?
__Sheldon Leonard and Penny.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I have good news.
__Leonard And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
__Sheldon Your cell phone was off.
__Leonard Because we didn't want to be disturbed.
__Sheldon And that didn't work out, did it?
__Penny Sheldon, what do you want?
__Sheldon I came to tell you I've got the answer.
__Leonard Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
__Sheldon No, no, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.
__Penny Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We're going to have to break up.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Penny Oh.
__Sheldon Einstein.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm going to need a little more.
__Sheldon Albert Einstein.
__Leonard Keep going.
__Sheldon When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.
__Leonard So, you're going to go work at the patent office?
__Sheldon Don't be absurd. That's in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I'm going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.
__Leonard Sounds like a great plan.
__Sheldon Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
__Leonard Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
__Sheldon You're welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you're on your back.
__Penny Leonard doesn't snore.
__Sheldon No, I wasn't talking to Leonard.
__Leonard Told you.
__Sheldon A menial job. Like yours.
__Assistant Why, thank you for noticing. I'm Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?
__Sheldon I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?
__Assistant No.
__Sheldon Shouldn't you check your database?
__Assistant No.
__Sheldon You didn't really type.
__Assistant I didn't really have to. So, how about construction?
__Sheldon Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
__Assistant No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.
__Sheldon I could do that.
__Sheldon One question.
__Assistant Yes?
__Sheldon What's sheetrock?
__Assistant Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?
__Sheldon That seems acceptable.
__Sheldon I don't drive.
__Assistant Of course you don't. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?
__Sheldon Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman's terms, string theory.
__Assistant I see. Just give me a second. Security!
__Sheldon Behind you.
__Penny Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
__Penny No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
__Sheldon A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don't like touching other people's coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.
__Sheldon Oh, heavens, no. Since I don't need to be paid, I didn't need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.
__Penny Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
__Sheldon Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
__Bernadette Thanks, Sheldon.
__Penny Sheldon, wait, this isn't even what I do. I'm a waitress, not a busboy.
__Leonard Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Double guacamole?
__Sheldon Of course.
__Leonard No cilantro?
__Leonard Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
__Sheldon Yep.
__Leonard You understand why I'm doing this to you?
__Sheldon I do.
__Leonard That'll be all. That was fun.
__Raj How long can he keep this up?
__Leonard I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.
__Raj He never went back to the university?
__Leonard Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg's shih tzu.
__Raj Sheesh.
__Howard I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.
__Raj But he's afraid of dogs.
__Leonard Yeah, that's the only thing wrong with that plan.
__Penny Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What's this?
__Leonard Sheldon took our order.
__Penny Sheldon doesn't work here.
__Leonard Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn't either.
__Sheldon Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I've been looking at it all wrong. I can't consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It's a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I don't work here.
__Raj I'm on a cloud. Swing me.
__Raj Dude, I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don't?
__Sheldon Actually, he might have to. There's an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it's not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.
__Howard That's not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
__Raj Thank you.
__Howard Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.
__Raj Me.
__Leonard Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
__Sheldon In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.
__Leonard Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine's Day?
__Howard Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There's a $39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.
__Sheldon Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
__Howard I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.
__Raj Well, if anyone's interested, I'll be spending this Valentine's Day the same way I spend every Valentine's Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.
__Leonard one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let's see, who's left? Oh, that's right. My plans. Isn't anyone going to ask?
__Raj Fine, tell us you're going to have sex with Penny.
__Leonard That's not what I was going to tell you.
__Raj It's okay. I don't mind hearing about your sex life. It's his that bugs me.
__Leonard Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
__Sheldon Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn't published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.
__Leonard Actually, Professor Norton can't make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.
__Howard I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
__Raj The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
__Howard That's the one.
__Leonard In any case, they're asking me to fill in for him.
__Sheldon In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
__Leonard Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
__Howard Oh, man!
__Raj No way, dude!
__Sheldon This is incredible! I'm so happy, I'm not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I'm just going to run home and start packing.
__Raj Why wouldn't you take Penny?
__Leonard I am taking Penny.
__Raj Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland.
__Sheldon Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?
__Leonard Penny.
__Sheldon What? That's absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
__Leonard Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.
__Sheldon But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
__Leonard I'm sorry, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Sorry? I've been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
__Leonard Yeah, well, I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day with a girl since I was six.
__Sheldon Shame on you! That's no dream for a scientist!
__Leonard Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine's Day.
__Penny Oh. Wow. Okay. Let's see. We've got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I'm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?
__Leonard No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.
__Penny Okay, I'm starting to think Swiss is key here.
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Penny We're going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
__Leonard How does that involve air travel?
__Penny We're going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
__Leonard No.
__Penny Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I'm over it.
__Leonard We're going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We'll also go skiing.
__Penny We're going skiing in Switzerland?!
__Leonard Well, you'll ski, I'll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine's Day.
__Penny Oh, my God, Leonard! That's incredible!
__Sheldon Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.
__Penny My Rabe-what-ly?
__Sheldon Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.
__Leonard Sheldon, we've been through this. I'm taking Penny.
__Sheldon Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
__Leonard Not the roommate agreement.
__Sheldon Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.
__Leonard Oh, for God's sakes.
__Penny You actually put that in an agreement?
__Leonard Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.
__Sheldon He can't kill me, even if I turn.
__Penny Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
__Sheldon No, that seemed a little farfetched.
__Leonard Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?
__Sheldon I've lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don't care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.
__Penny Okay, I know I shouldn't ask, but what is…?
__Leonard No.
__Leonard Look, Sheldon, I know it's in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.
__Sheldon Is that your final decision?
__Leonard It is.
__Sheldon Very well.
__Penny It's not over, is it?
__Leonard What do you think? (The sound of Tuvan throat singing comes from Sheldon's bedroom.)
__Sheldon All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
__Leonard You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
__Sheldon You're right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
__Leonard Come on, Sheldon. Can't you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
__Sheldon Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.
__Leonard Rupert Murdoch?
__Sheldon He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.
__Raj I know. I saw the Tweet.
__Howard So, what did you end up doing?
__Raj Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
__Leonard You seen Sheldon?
__Raj No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
__Leonard Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?
__Howard I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.
__Leonard Seriously?
__Howard Absolutely. And I'd leave him there.
__Raj What the hell is that?
__Leonard Uh, let's see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Sheldon I've made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here's Frodo.
__Leonard You made Frodo pancakes?
__Sheldon Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.
__Sheldon It's by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I've had some time to reflect and I've come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It's a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
__Leonard Thanks. It's good.
__Sheldon What you're tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you've finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.
__Leonard You hate Babylon 5.
__Sheldon I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it's hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you're my friend.
__Leonard Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.
__Sheldon Drat. No Frodo for you.
__Penny Hello.
__Sheldon Alright, let's dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I'm here.
__Penny Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.
__Sheldon Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I'm here in the laundry room.
__Penny Better acoustics for your throat singing?
__Sheldon It's actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.
__Penny Oh, for God's sakes.
__Sheldon Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
__Penny I'm sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
__Sheldon Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let's see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.
__Penny Okay, show's over.
__Sheldon No, it's not. I've got five more slides.
__Penny Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.
__Sheldon Very well. Enjoy yourself. You're going to be in the presence of something that I've dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
__Penny I'll talk to Leonard.
__Sheldon You will?
__Penny Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.
__Sheldon Oh, Penny, thank you!
__Penny You're welcome.
__Sheldon Since I rarely hug, I'm relying on your expertise regarding duration.
__Penny I think we're there.
__Sheldon Oh, good. Bye-bye.
__Howard Trust me, you can't. I've tried.
__Raj No, no, no, I'm going to have a me day. First I'm going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I'm going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.
__Leonard Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
__Sheldon All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?
__Leonard Some what?
__Sheldon Cholermus. It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
__Leonard You're not going to Switzerland!
__Sheldon Oh, but I am. Didn't Penny tell you the good news?
__Leonard She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
__Sheldon Yes, that good news.
__Leonard Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it's Penny, not you!
__Sheldon Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.
__Leonard I don't need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
__Sheldon That's a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
__Leonard Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.
__Sheldon Really?
__Leonard Yeah, really.
__Sheldon Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.
__Leonard I'm sorry you feel that way.
__Sheldon I don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.
__Leonard Why don't you enlighten me?
__Sheldon With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates' house should I be invited.
__Howard Ooh, that's gotta sting.
__Penny I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
__Leonard Thermal? ‘Cause it's gonna be cold.
__Penny Think it through, Leonard.
__Leonard Oh!
__Penny Oh!
__Leonard Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?
__Penny No, no, it's probably just allergies.
__Leonard Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have 'em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.
__Penny Do any of them work?
__Leonard Not really, I'm just an enthusiast.
__ Penny? You okay?
__Penny Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
__Leonard What's going on?
__Penny I'm having a tea party. What do you think's going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
__Leonard Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you'll feel better by then?
__Penny Yep. ‘Cause I'm gonna be dead.
__Sheldon Great. I'll start packing. In a minute.  Oh, look, it's the cholermus.
__Sheldon Chicken?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon With the little stars?
__Penny Yes.
__Penny Why don't I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.
__Sheldon You don't have to be mean. I'm sick.
__Penny Yeah, well, I'm sick, too.
__Sheldon Not my problem. I just don't understand how this happened to me. I'm scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.
__Penny I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon It's you! I touched you!
__Penny Happy Valentine's Day.
__Leonard Yeah, I forgot about all this.
__Raj But I never will.
__Raj What? I'm giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I'm awesome and to be feared.
__Howard Yeah, right, there's nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who's got music blasting from between his nipples.
__Leonard Hey, Stuart, what's going on?
__Stuart Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.
__Sheldon Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I'm sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
__Stuart No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan's doing him a favour.
__Sheldon Oh, I don't want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?
__Leonard Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
__Sheldon Well, look who thinks he's Stuart's uncle now.
__Raj Can't believe it. We're going to meet Stan Lee! (Presses play on his iPod. His shirt starts to play “I'm So Excited” by the Pointer Sisters. He dances.)
__Howard I'm sad to say I taught him those moves.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon I've decided I'm going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month's Batman.
__Howard That's crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.
__Sheldon Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.
__Raj That's a great idea, I'm going to get him to sign a Batman as well.
__Sheldon What is it about the word unique you don't understand?
__Howard Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.
__Raj Well, obviously you don't remember your circumcision.
__Sheldon There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
__Howard Why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
__Leonard He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
__Sheldon Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.
__Penny Hi!
__Leonard Hey. Guess who's going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
__Penny Um, can you give me a hint?
__Leonard Stan Lee.
__Penny Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?
__Leonard No, no, Stan Lee.
__Penny Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!
__Leonard You have no idea who he is, do you?
__Penny Of course I do. You're an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
__Leonard Good, good, so, who's Stan Lee?
__Penny Um, he was on Star Trek.
__Leonard Nope.
__Penny Star Wars?
__Leonard No.
__Penny Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?
__Leonard That's Bruce Lee.
__Penny Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee's nerdy brother, Stan?
__Howard Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?
__Sheldon Because most of the things I'm planning to buy haven't been invented yet.
__Howard But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don't you put it in the bank?
__Sheldon I don't trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.
__Howard You've also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
__Sheldon Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it's supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.
__Penny I'm sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
__Sheldon It bothers me.
__Howard Sheldon, this is a summons.
__Sheldon A summons for what?
__Howard Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.
__Sheldon November 16? Penny, that's the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.
__Penny No, it isn't.
__Sheldon Yes, it is.
__Sheldon Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that's a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.
__Sheldon Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?
__Penny Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn't driving and they were all, if it wasn't you, who was it?
__Sheldon So you betrayed me?
__Penny No! It wasn't a betrayal. It was more of a can't afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
__Sheldon But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
__Penny Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.
__Leonard It's not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
__Sheldon I'm not going to pay a fine. That would imply I'm guilty.
__Howard You are guilty. (Raj's shirt plays the gavel sound from Law & Order) That one I liked.
__Sheldon I am not guilty. I only have a learner's permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.
__Penny Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.
__Sheldon You don't need to reimburse me because I'm not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I'm going to begin preparing my defence right now.
__Howard Okay, he's going to jail.
__Leonard Oh, that's right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.
__Sheldon Now you see what you've done? Because of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee.
__Leonard Whoa! What do you mean all?
__Sheldon Well, you're my friends. You'll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious.
__Leonard Yeah, okay. No.
__Sheldon Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
__Leonard That's what I'm saying.
__Howard Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice it would've been a much shorter movie. No.
__Sheldon Raj? You'll be there, won't you? (Shirt plays “incorrect” quiz sound) All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness.
__Penny Oh, balls.
__Sheldon Please try to wear something appropriate. It won't help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
__Penny Penny.
__Sheldon That's just wrong.
__Penny All right, let's go.
__Sheldon Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I'd like to call on your skills as an actress.
__Penny What is this?
__Sheldon I've taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let's face it, you're somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don't worry, it's written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?
__Penny Do I have a choice?
__Sheldon Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?
__Penny Darn tootin', I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.
__Sheldon Excellent. Go on.
__Penny The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever.
__Penny Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.
__Sheldon There's no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.
__Penny But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
__Sheldon Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
__Penny But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally.
__Sheldon Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
__Sheldon Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself.
__Judge I know what it means. I went to law school.
__Sheldon And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I'd like to begin with an opening statement.
__Judge The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.
__Sheldon Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I'm unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.
__Judge Impressive.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Judge Guilty. Pay the cashier.
__Sheldon I object. You're completely ignoring the law.
__Judge No, I'm following the law. I'm ignoring you.
__Sheldon Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.
__Judge Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I'm going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.
__Sheldon I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
__Leonard Oh, come on, why would you do that?
__Raj Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.
__Howard Okay, I'm cutting. I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Sheldon's in jail.
__Leonard Sheldon's in jail?
__Raj You called it.
__Leonard For what?
__Penny What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.
__Penny Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn't occur to me. If he doesn't apologize by 5 o'clock he is going to spend the night in jail.
__Leonard Oh, no, that's terrible. Ooh, the line's moving. Got to go. Bye.
__Guard What?
__Sheldon I need to use the restroom.
__Guard Knock yourself out.
__Guard Well, it ain't a wishing well.
__Sheldon Please tell the judge I'm ready to apologize.
__Howard Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!
__Raj Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee.
__Howard That's 'cause you pissed him off about his character names.
__Raj Hey, I didn't even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.
__Penny We're home.
__Leonard Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?
__Sheldon You know very well how it went.
__Leonard Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.
__Sheldon I was found guilty and fined $533.
__Penny I'm going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.
__Sheldon I also now have three points on a driver's licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.
__Howard Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.
__Leonard Okay, that's enough, Howard. The poor guy's had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.
__Howard You're right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.
__Sheldon You had gelato with Stan Lee?
__Howard He said we could call him Stan.
__Leonard Except for Raj.
__Sheldon Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.
__Penny Okay, I realize that…
__Penny Okay, maybe you'll have another chance to have…
__Sheldon No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!
__Penny Did he just somehow give me the finger?
__Howard Not just the finger. The moving finger.
__Stuart Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi.
__Penny What's going on?
__Stuart Nothing. I'm just getting ready to close up and head out.
__Penny Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?
__Stuart Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat.
__Penny Oh, nice.
__Stuart Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn't even show up.
__Penny Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour.
__Stuart Sure, yeah, name it.
__Penny Well, I'm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.
__Stuart Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have his phone number.
__Penny Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.
__Stuart Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address.
__Penny Really? Great!
__Stuart But I can't give it to you.
__Penny Then why did you tell me you had it?
__Stuart I don't know. Just chatting. You're looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight.
__Penny I'm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.
__Stuart Mm-hmm. Wait.
__Penny Yeah?
__Stuart Maybe we can make a deal.
__Stuart I will give you the address if you go to my cousin's wedding with me.
__Penny You're extorting a date out of me?
__Stuart I kind of have to. The cousin who's getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.
__Penny Can I bring Leonard?
__Stuart Sure. What the hell.
__Penny Deal.
__Stuart We'll tell people he's your cousin.
__Penny Yup.
__Sheldon Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell. At Stan Lee's house. We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.
__Penny Okay, sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna have cookies, or he's just gonna say hi, or really what's gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we'll…
__Stan Lee Yeah?
__Penny Are you Stan Lee?
__Stan Lee Oh, damn.
__Penny Hi. I'm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.
__Sheldon We're not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
__Penny Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail.
__Stan Lee I see. And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited?
__Sheldon You said we were invited.
__Stan Lee You know, you fan boys are unbelievable. Do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want? I mean, why don't you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?
__Sheldon Well, I'm not much of a sports fan, but thank you.
__Penny I'm sorry. He doesn't really understand sarcasm.
__Stan Lee Well, I'll give him something he'll understand. Joanie, call the police!
__Penny Nice to meet you.
__Howard Would you just let it go?
__Raj And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.
__Leonard Hey, where've you been?
__Sheldon I'll tell you where I've been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.
__Howard Sweet.
__Sheldon Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.
__Sheldon Well, it's very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I'm the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.
__Leonard One more floor, and I'd be the pulled muscle.
__Penny Oh, it's about time, I'm starving.
__Leonard Uh, well, we didn't actually get Chinese food.
__Penny Why not?
__Leonard Don't panic, this is better.
__Penny Oh, no, you didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?
__Sheldon Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.
__Penny Yeah, sometimes I don't listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.
__Leonard We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.
__Penny Who's Adam West?
__Sheldon Who's Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?
__Howard My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That's why I'm the funny one.
__Leonard Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.
__Howard They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.
__Leonard We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
__Penny There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one.
__Leonard No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  Oh, you're right, it's Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.
__Howard Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where's my daddy, puppet? Where is he?
__Penny That is so sad.
__Sheldon No, what's sad is that you don't know Adam West was TV's Batman.
__ Credits sequence
__Penny Okay, I'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.
__Leonard Okay, bye.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.
__Raj And an Aquaman action figure.
__Howard Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
__Howard You see what you're doing? Stop that.
__Sheldon Fascinating.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
__Leonard Oh.
__Raj It's even got the Elvish engraving on it.
__Sheldon It's not Elvish. It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
__ rule them all.
__ One Ring to find them.
__Howard One Ring to bring them all.
__Leonard And in the darkness bind them.
__Raj Holy crap, are we nerdy.
__Raj Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?
__Sheldon Yes, there is. Oh, here's a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.
__Raj No, that's okay. I'll get it.
__Howard Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.
__Leonard Seedy underbelly?
__Raj Who's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
__Howard Just a guy. I know a guy.
__Raj Is it Eddie Crispo?
__Howard No, I can't tell you who it is. Stop asking.
__Raj Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
__Howard I know lots of dangerous people, okay?
__Raj Name one.
__Howard Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn't a replica. It's the real deal.
__Sheldon If you're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.
__Leonard He's not saying it's a magic ring. You're not, are you?
__Howard No, but it's close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.
__Sheldon Mine!
__Leonard No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.
__Sheldon Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.
__Leonard How is this maritime salvage?
__Sheldon Other than the lack of water, how is it not?
__Raj Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?
__Howard Well, it's tough to say since it's hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…
__Raj Your guy Eddie Crispo?
__Howard Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.
__Raj Okay, that's a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.
__Howard Why do you want a jet ski?
__Raj All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can't just be a coincidence.
__Sheldon We can't sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.
__Howard It's sad how great that sounds.
__Leonard Guys, it's stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.
__Howard Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
__Raj There are no Jewish hobbits.
__Howard Clearly, you've never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.
__Leonard We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where's the ring?
__Sheldon You mean my ring?
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.
__Leonard Give me that.
__Raj Look, let's be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.
__Sheldon I found it. The ring is mine. I don't understand why in this group I never get my way.
__Sheldon I'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
__Penny Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?
__Leonard Yeah, it's delicious, the sarcasm's a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.
__Penny What ring?
__Leonard This ring.
__Leonard Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
__Penny Why?
__Leonard It's a prop from a movie, and we're kind of fighting over it.
__Penny Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don't even get to keep it?
__Howard If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you'd have my great Aunt Ida's brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.
__Leonard How am I looking now?
__Leonard What was that?
__Penny Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
__Leonard That's my girl.
__Sheldon It's not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I'd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.
__Raj Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?
__Leonard No.
__Raj I was afraid of that.  Go ahead.
__Man on Screen Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj's attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.
__Raj Also my cousin.
__Howard You brought a lawyer?
__Venkatesh Don't answer that. I'll get straight to the point. My client's prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.
__Leonard We're not giving him two Jet Skis.
__Venkatesh Look, we're big boys, why don't we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.
__Leonard No Jet Skis.
__Venkatesh All right, forget the Jet Skis.
__Raj Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”
__Venkatesh What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.
__Raj You're useless.
__Venkatesh I told you that when you hired me.
__Raj I'm signing off now.
__Venkatesh Call your mother, she worries.
__Howard Okay, just so you know, if we're bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.
__Leonard You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn't want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I'm sending it back. Where's the ring?
__Sheldon You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men's room.
__Leonard Give me that.
__Sheldon No, it's mine.
__Raj It's all of ours.
__Leonard Okay, now, this is ridiculous!
__Howard Then let go!
__Howard I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
__Leonard Fine. But can't we go home and start this?
__Raj Sure. Let go of the ring.
__Leonard All right, it starts now.
__Howard You do realize there's a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.
__Raj Wait, my laptop.
__Leonard And it wasn't when we were driving like this?
__Sheldon I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
__Leonard You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
__Raj There are six seasons, dude.
__Leonard Oh, crap!
__Raj No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don't know if we can trust him again. It's a wild ride.
__Leonard Door.
__Raj Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.
__Penny Whatcha doin'?
__Leonard Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.
__Penny No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny FYI, this is a bag from Victoria's Secret.
__Leonard I'm out.
__Raj No, he's doesn't! He's lying to you!
__Howard Will you be quiet?
__Raj Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I'm so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here's more bacon to tuck into the shiksa's G-string!
__Howard I'll call you back.
__Raj I think it's lovely you call your mommy and let her know you're going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn't breast-feed on time, it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.
__Howard Don't you talk about my mother's boobies!
__Raj If you're offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother's boobies.
__Sheldon Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don't you go after Raj's mother?
__Raj Why don't we go after your mother?
__Sheldon Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you'd like to add?
__Howard That's not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
__Raj You're right. Let's talk about your grandmother.
__Sheldon No! I call no Meemaws.
__Raj Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
__Sheldon I don't want to hear this.
__Howard Then let go of the ring and walk away.
__Sheldon Never.
__Howard All right. I'll bet your Meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
__Sheldon Stop it!
__Raj Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.
__Sheldon I said stop it!
__Howard We're getting to him.
__Sheldon Waterfalls!
__Raj What?
__Sheldon Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
__Howard What are you doing?
__Sheldon Subliminal messaging. I'm going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
__Raj It's, it's not working, dude.
__Sheldon Oh-ho-ho, it's working all right. I have to pee.
__Raj Then let go of the ring and go.
__Howard No, actually, I wouldn't mind going, too.
__Raj Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…
__Sheldon Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?
__Howard We stand up.
__Sheldon Excellent choice.
__Raj Three.
__Howard Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
__Leonard It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
__Raj The fires of Mount Doom?
__Leonard Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand. It wasn't ours.
__Howard You quit the game! You had no right to take it.
__Leonard I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.
__Raj Well, so then we start the game over until there's a winner.
__Leonard There wasn't ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don't want anything to do with you. And I don't know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up!  My precious.
__Leonard NEVER!
__ Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.
__Howard Yeah, so?
__Raj So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails.
__Howard What's your point?
__Raj My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I'd be very nervous around James Cameron.
__Sheldon It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn't William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science.
__Sheldon And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I'll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?
__Leonard Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that. You.
__Sheldon I won?
__Leonard You won.
__Sheldon I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It's not astonishing, more like inevitable. I'm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I'm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.
__Raj Well, good for him.
__ Credits sequence
__Raj No.
__Leonard Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.
__Sheldon Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.
__Howard Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.
__Sheldon Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call  three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don't want to forfeit the award? Well, you've got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you.  Problem.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can't give a speech.
__Howard Well, no, you're mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can't do is shut up.
__Raj Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.
__Sheldon I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
__Leonard What, to you, is a large crowd?
__Sheldon Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
__Sheldon I'm not accepting the award.
__Penny Why not?
__Howard Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.
__Penny That's no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen's court.
__Sheldon Thank you. Yeah, I'll bear that in mind if I'm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.
__Leonard Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.
__Sheldon Am I? Let me tell you a story.
__Howard Where's 70 children when you need ‘em?
__Sheldon I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
__Penny I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
__Sheldon I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear.
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Leonard Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
__Sheldon Don't trample me.
__Leonard Sit down, we want to talk to you.
__Sheldon Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
__Penny Just sit.
__Leonard We think we can help you with your stage fright.
__Sheldon Oh, I doubt that. I haven't figured out a way, and I'm much smarter than all of you.
__Penny Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm sorry, that is what I meant.
__Penny Okay, your problem is, you're trying to do this all by yourself.
__Leonard We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.
__Sheldon I do like the X-Men.
__Penny Did I see X-Men?
__Leonard Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.
__Penny Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?
__Sheldon I don't know. If you're my X-Men, what are your powers?
__Penny Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.
__Sheldon That's not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?
__Leonard I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
__Sheldon What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
__Leonard My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I've been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.
__Howard Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don't know, some Indian meditation crap.
__Sheldon I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you're saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.
__Howard My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that's 24-7, buddy.
__Sheldon And I appreciate the pretence.
__Penny So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?
__Sheldon No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.
__Howard Oh, that's not a good name.
__Sheldon And yet, you can't speak to women.
__Raj True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.
__Sheldon Okay, but don't punch me.
__Raj What?
__Sheldon When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you'll get a surprise, and then she'd punch me.
__Raj I'm not going to punch you.
__Raj Do you want to do this or not?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Proceed.
__Raj All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
__Sheldon Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.
__Raj Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.
__Sheldon Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?
__Raj Whatever you like.
__Sheldon I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
__Raj Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.
__Sheldon Really? This time of year? It's a bit nippy.
__Raj Then, put on a sweater.
__Sheldon Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
__Raj Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.
__Sheldon You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.
__Raj You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
__Sheldon Look, I didn't turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.
__Raj All right. You've paid for a sweater, and you're in Sheldon Square.
__Sheldon Hang on. It's a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.
__Raj What now?
__Sheldon A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can't run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror!  Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.
__Penny It'll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I'm feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.
__Sheldon Don't you eventually realize you're just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
__Penny Yeah, that's when I buy shoes. Now, let's see what we've got. Ooh! This is nice.
__Sheldon It's only one colour.
__Penny Yeah, so?
__Sheldon That's a lot of money for only one colour.
__Penny Fine. Why don't you pick out what you like.
__Sheldon Hmm.  This is pretty sharp.
__Penny No, you're wrong.
__Sheldon This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six.  Okay, I think we have a winner.
__Penny Where the hell d'you find that?
__Sheldon In the prom department.
__Penny It's ridiculous.
__Sheldon Says the former member of the Corn Queen's Court.
__Penny Please just try this one on.
__Sheldon Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  This is absurd. I look like a clown.
__Sheldon That's how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph's.
__Leonard I'm sorry, I'll start again.
__Leonard Um, I don't know, maybe.
__Sheldon I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.
__Leonard How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
__Sheldon I was wearing size a million pants.
__Leonard Why don't we just talk?
__Sheldon Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
__Leonard Why don't I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that's what's happening here?
__Sheldon Really, Leonard? You're just going to try to recycle Adler's doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph's. And she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.
__Leonard But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n' Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.
__Sheldon And how did that make you feel?
__Leonard Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
__Sheldon Go on.
__Leonard It wasn't my fault. I had never seen my brother's project. And my mother could've told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
__Sheldon So, I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.
__Leonard Damn right, I'm angry with my mother. For God's sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That's when the bed-wetting started again.
__Leonard For what?
__Sheldon If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.
__Leonard Wait, that's it? I thought we had a whole hour!
__Sheldon Oh, dear.
__Penny What's the matter?
__Sheldon I'm getting dizzy.
__Raj Don't worry. You're surrounded by your C-Men.
__Sheldon I can't do this. I'm going to faint.
__Penny Here, drink this. It'll relax you.
__Sheldon Alcohol? I don't drink alcohol.
__Penny Fine, faint.
__Sheldon I don't feel different, this alcohol's defective.
__Penny Here, see if this one works.
__Leonard First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn't hear me. If you'd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I'd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.
__Sheldon I'm ready.
__Leonard Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
__Sheldon Thanks, shorty,I'll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you're out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who's happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it's only 'cause I have no respect for the field. Let's get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we're scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what's the universe made of? I am so glad you asked.  There's antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,
__ neptunium, germanium… Everybody! And iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium… Just the Asians! And lanthanum and osmium, and astatine and radium…
__Penny Sure.
__Sheldon Question one, where are my pants?
__Leonard You might want to check YouTube.
__Sheldon What do I search?
__Leonard It's already loaded. Just hit play.
__On-screen Sheldon On- All right, people, let's get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body's in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.
__Sheldon Oh, Lord, this couldn't be any more humiliating.
__On-screen Sheldon On- Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here's Uranus.
__Leonard No, no, I'm good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.
__Penny Do or do not. There is no try.
__Leonard Did you just quote Star Wars?
__Penny I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
__Leonard Oh, my God. I'm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.
__Penny Oh. Oh. Thank you.
__Leonard You're welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
__Penny Oh, yeah, no, I, I'm, I'm glad.
__Leonard Good. Glad is good.
__Penny Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it's getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Hmm.
__Penny Okay, good night, sweetie.
__Leonard Good night.
__ Credits sequence
__Raj Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.
__Sheldon You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.
__Leonard Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
__Howard What's with him?
__Sheldon Perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
__Howard Are you saying he's man-struating?
__Sheldon Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men's hormone levels.
__Raj Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I'm talking about.
__Raj Big or small, I don't like rabbits. They always look like they're about to say something, but they never do.
__Sheldon Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.
__Raj Maybe that's what they want to talk about.
__Howard Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?
__Leonard I honestly don't care.
__Raj Really? Because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals, you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.
__Leonard What do you want from me? I just don't give a rat's ass.
__Howard Would that be a giant rat's ass?
__Sheldon For the record, giant rats are possible.
__Leonard Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
__Howard Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.
__Raj Maybe he's having a lover's spat with Penny.
__Leonard No, there was no spat.
__Howard Oh, but something happened.
__Leonard I don't want to talk about it.
__Sheldon But I sense you're going to and I don't want to hear about it. Excuse me.
__Howard What'd you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?
__Raj Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?
__Leonard What? No.
__Raj I'm just asking, dude. It happens.
__Stuart You guys still on for bowling tonight?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. In fact, I've prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.
__Stuart Oh. Ouch.
__Sheldon That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
__Howard Did you ask her to start waxing?
__Leonard No.
__Leonard No.
__Howard While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?
__Leonard I'm walking away from you now.
__Howard That wasn't a no.
__Raj Yeah, I think we're getting close.
__Raj Oh, that would be a good way to go.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Oh, hey.
__Sheldon Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o'clock.
__Penny Oh, right, bowling.
__Leonard You don't have to come if you don't want to.
__Penny No, no, it's okay. I mean, let's face it, you guys would get creamed without me.
__Sheldon We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.
__Penny It's always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Sarcasm?
__Penny Thinly veiled contempt.
__Sheldon Remember, seven o'clock.
__Penny Got it.
__Sheldon Pacific Daylight time!
__Penny Bite me!
__Sheldon Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
__Sheldon These are my own bowling shoes.
__Howard Then what's with the disinfectant?
__Sheldon I know where my feet have been.
__Stuart Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn't make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.
__Wil Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?
__Sheldon Well, well, well. If it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.
__Wil You're not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?
__Sheldon I'm the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?
__Wil It tells me that I am living rent-free right here (pointing at Sheldon's head). You ready to bowl?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm ready. I don't know if Stuart told you what you're up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny's pretty good.
__Wil Great. Then it's on.
__Sheldon Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.
__ Time lapse.
__Sheldon A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it's really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes.  Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.
__Howard Hey, I just wanted to tell you I'm a big fan.
__Wil Oh, thanks.
__Howard I'm sure you're probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?
__Raj Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.
__Leonard Chilli cheese fry?
__Penny Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.
__Leonard Really? You love them?
__Penny Yeah, why?
__Leonard No reason. I'm just glad to hear you're comfortable saying you love something.
__Penny Do you really want to get into this right now?
__Leonard Get into what? Why wouldn't you love the chilli cheese fries? They've been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
__Penny Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn't know what to say.
__Leonard Okay, well, now you've had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?
__Penny I'm not sure.
__Leonard How can you not be sure?
__Penny Okay, this isn't the place to have this conversation.
__Leonard No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.
__Penny Don't push it, Leonard.
__Leonard I am not pushing anything.
__Penny You are. You don't get to decide when I'm ready to say I love you!
__Raj Ah, the premature I love you.
__Howard I guessed premature. Does that count?
__Penny What?
__Sheldon This is for you.
__Penny Ice cream?
__Sheldon I've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she's upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.
__Penny Um, Ach.
__Penny Did Leonard send you over here?
__Sheldon No, we haven't spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.
__Penny Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
__Sheldon I'm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
__Penny Again, I'm sorry.
__Penny You're kidding.
__Sheldon No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
__Penny All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?
__Sheldon The part where I tell you I've engineered a rematch with Stuart's team for tonight.
__Penny Oh, honey, I don't know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.
__Sheldon You want me to remove him from the team? I'm the captain, I can do that.
__Penny No, no, that's okay. Just let me talk to him, and I'll get back to you.
__Sheldon When are you going to talk to him?
__Penny I don't know.
__Sheldon He's in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
__Penny You're not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?
__Sheldon Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.
__Leonard What? No, it's okay. We don't have to talk 'cause there's nothing to talk about. Everything's good.
__Penny Really? So, you didn't get all snarky 'cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?
__Leonard All right, maybe I overreacted. So we're in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I'm a little ahead of you. That's fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, 'cause let's face it, I've been in this relationship two years longer than you.
__Penny Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It's just that I've said the L word too soon before, and it didn't work out very well.
__Leonard Really? I wouldn't know what that's like.
__Penny I'm sorry. You know what I'm talking about, though.
__Leonard Yeah, I do.
__Penny So, we're good?
__Leonard Yes, that's what I'm telling you. We are good. We are great.
__Sheldon All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there's a lot at stake here.
__Penny The Wesley Crushers?
__Sheldon No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”
__Penny I don't get it.
__Leonard Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek.
__Penny Still don't get it.
__Sheldon It's a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character's name and adding the S, we imply that we we'll be the crushers of Wesley.
__Penny Okay, I'm sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.
__Sheldon What? No! Again, it's not the Wesley Crushers. It's the Wesley “Crushers.”
__Howard You know, if you want it to mean you're crushing Wesley, it'd be the “Wesley” Crushers.
__Sheldon Do you people even hear yourselves? It's not the Wesley Crushers. It's not the “Wesley” Crushers. It's the Wesley “Crushers.”
__Wil Hey, look. They named their team after me.
__Sheldon No, it's not the… Never mind.
__Stuart So, we're all clear on the bet and the stakes?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.
__Stuart Ouch again.
__Wil Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I'm really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.
__Sheldon Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?
__ Time lapse.
__ After you.
__Sheldon No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.
__Wil It's customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.
__Sheldon All right.
__Wil It's a custom, not a rule.
__Sheldon I so loathe you.
__Wil That's right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.
__Sheldon That's not even from your franchise!
__Stuart I, um, I want you to know that even though we're on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.
__Penny Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.
__Stuart Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what's-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I'm gonna bowl now.
__Sheldon Be the ball, Howard.
__Howard Leave me alone, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You weren't the ball.
__Penny Hey, thanks.
__Leonard This is fun, huh?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard It's good that we got out and did something physical.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Leonard Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That's not what we're doing tonight. Tonight we're just throwing a ball at some pins.
__Penny Yeah, that's right.
__Leonard Mm-hmm, and someday, we don't know when, maybe you'll love me back. Ooh, I'm up.
__All Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!
__Sheldon Excuse me. I don't know who you're chanting for as I am currently the ball.
__All The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
__Sheldon Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.
__Wil I'm glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.
__Penny Oh, yeah, me, too.
__Wil It's always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you're not ready for it.
__Penny Tell me about it.
__Wil I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn't sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal.
__Penny Oh, I'm sorry.
__Wil Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery.
__Penny Really?
__Stuart Wil, you're up.
__Wil Oh, that's me.
__Sheldon Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
__Penny What are you talking about?
__Sheldon He's evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
__Penny No!
__Sheldon Well, if he does, don't believe it. He's not above playing the dead meemaw card.
__Wil Yes!
__Sheldon Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.
__Sheldon All right, remember, his meemaw's alive and be the ball.
__Penny Yeah, I got it.
__Leonard We really need a strike here.
__Penny I know.
__Leonard So just take your time and concentrate.
__Penny Leonard, stop pressuring me.
__Leonard I'm not pressuring you.
__Penny Yeah, you are! Just back off!
__Leonard Okay, I'm sorry. I'll shut up.
__Penny I didn't mean shut up.
__Leonard Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.
__Penny No, this isn't fair to you, Leonard. I'm sorry.
__Sheldon Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I'll get you ice cream!
__Leonard No, let her go.
__Sheldon Are you insane? If she leaves, it's over!
__Leonard I'm pretty sure it's already over.
__Wil Tough luck, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You did this, didn't you?
__Wil Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?
__Sheldon No, I suppose not.
__Wil Good. Keep thinking that.
__Sheldon Wheaton!
__ I don't know about you, but I feel empowered.
__Sheldon Uh-oh.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon I was going to get my mail.
__Penny Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?
__Sheldon I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.
__Penny God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
__Sheldon Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.
__Penny Okay, here's the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
__Sheldon Good, good. I'm glad we're still friends.
__Penny Really?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.
__Penny Right.
__Sheldon Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
__Penny Everyone.
__Sheldon Harsh terms. But all right, I'll just substitute intercourse.
__Penny Great.
__Sheldon Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.
__Penny So, how you been?
__Sheldon Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
__Penny You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?
__Sheldon Bazinga.
__Penny Mmm. How's Leonard doing?
__Sheldon He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.
__Penny I'll pretend I didn't hear it.
__Sheldon I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
__Penny Yep.
__Sheldon That's the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.
__Penny Interesting. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
__Sheldon I'm hungry now.
__Penny Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over?
__Sheldon Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
__Penny I don't have hot dogs.
__Sheldon Oh, it's all right, I do. Oh! You're in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat.
__Leonard Hey, where you been?
__Sheldon I was talking with Penny.
__Howard What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool.
__Leonard No, no, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.
__Raj Yeah, he's over it, that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
__Sheldon Is he making any progress? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
__Howard So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.
__Sheldon Which one picks last?
__Howard What?
__Sheldon Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.
__Leonard Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?
__Leonard I don't know. Why?
__Sheldon Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!
__ Credits sequence
__Raj Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
__Howard Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux.
__Leonard Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!
__Leonard So, you guys want to do something tonight?
__Howard Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.
__Leonard What about you, Raj?
__Raj Oh, there it is, now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.
__Leonard I never stopped hanging out with you.
__Raj Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
__Leonard You know what? I'll just spend the evening alone.
__Raj What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you?
__Sheldon Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.
__Leonard Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
__Howard Yeah, since when do you take walks?
__Sheldon I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye.
__Howard Hold on. I'll walk down with you.
__Sheldon Oh, that's not necessary. You can go first.
__Howard Or we could go together.
__Sheldon I can't think of a reason why not.
__Howard Let's go.
__Sheldon Hold on. Nope, no reason.
__Howard Okay.
__Sheldon What?
__Howard You said you were going for a walk.
__Sheldon I didn't say outside.
__Howard So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?
__Sheldon No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
__Howard Which way are you going?
__Sheldon Which way are you going?
__Howard I parked my scooter down the block.
__Sheldon I'm going the other way. Bye.
__Howard Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs?
__Sheldon No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.
__Howard I definitely smell raw hot dog.
__Sheldon Perhaps you're getting a brain tumour.
__Howard All right, have a nice walk.
__Sheldon I shall. Have a nice scoot.
__Howard You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.
__Sheldon Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!
__Raj I haven't had sex in a year.
__Leonard Where you going with this, Raj?
__Raj Don't flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.
__Leonard So, go.
__Raj Well, I need a wingman. I don't want to come off like a lonely loser.
__Leonard And you think my presence will help with that?
__Raj Well, I do. Next to you, I'll look like a catch.
__Leonard I'm not going out tonight, Raj.
__Raj All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
__Leonard Very much.
__Raj Doesn't have to be Asian.
__Leonard Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday.
__Raj No, I won't.
__Leonard I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.
__Penny So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I'm fine, I don't care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.
__Penny Well, good.
__Sheldon I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.
__Penny He's been crying?
__Sheldon Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention.
__Penny Oh, God, I feel terrible.
__Sheldon Do you have a stomach ache, too?
__Penny No. Why, do you?
__Sheldon No.
__Penny Why did you ask if I had one, too?
__Sheldon Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
__Penny All right. So, what's new in your life?
__Sheldon Well, my new shoes are not made for running.
__Penny Have you been running?
__Sheldon No. It's just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
__Penny I'm so glad you like it.
__Sheldon I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
__Penny Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook.
__Sheldon You can't cook and you made me this.
__Penny Whatever. Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
__Sheldon Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.
__Leonard I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.
__Raj You don't know that. Prison changes people.
__Leonard Hey, where you been?
__Sheldon I told you, walking.
__Leonard For an hour and a half?
__Leonard How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
__Sheldon Satellites are down. Solar flares.
__Raj There are no solar flares right now.
__Sheldon Yes, there are.
__Raj Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
__Leonard What the hell was that about?
__Raj I don't know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
__Leonard Oh, we really need to get you a girl.
__Leonard Oh, just come in!
__Sheldon Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
__Leonard What do you want, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Maybe this isn't a good time.
__Leonard Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
__Sheldon Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
__Leonard What do you want?
__Sheldon You may want to sit down.
__Leonard I'm in bed!
__Sheldon Point taken. You may want to sit up.
__Leonard Sheldon!
__Sheldon I've been seeing Penny behind your back.
__Leonard Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?
__Sheldon We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?
__Leonard Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
__Sheldon I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.
__Leonard Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
__Sheldon I didn't want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
__Leonard Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
__Sheldon Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.
__Leonard Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.
__Leonard I guess not.
__Sheldon And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
__Leonard D-don't be silly. We're neighbours, we're going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.
__Penny Yeah, I guess you're right.
__Leonard You used to it yet?
__Penny Nope.
__Leonard Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it's fine.
__Penny Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.
__Leonard His mother?
__Penny Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.
__Leonard I was going to do that.
__Penny Oh, well, then you, you do it.
__Leonard No, I don't want to do it. You can do it.
__Penny Okay, you can take him for shoes.
__Leonard I just took him for shoes.
__Penny Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
__Penny Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.
__Leonard You're taking him to Disneyland?
__Penny Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?
__Leonard All right. But let me know if you're going to stuff him with junk food. I don't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
__Penny We're going to Disneyland. He's going to eat junk food.
__Leonard All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.
__Penny Okay, whatever.
__Leonard And don't let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He'll say he can handle it, but I promise you'll end up with churro puke on your shoes.
__Penny All right, got it. Is there anything else?
__Leonard Yeah, don't let Goofy near him. He'll have nightmares and I'll have to deal with it.
__Penny What's the problem with Goofy?
__Leonard Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.
__Howard Well, that's it. We're officially out of things to talk about.
__Penny We're home.
__Leonard It's ten o'clock, where have you been?
__Sheldon We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
__Leonard I was going to see that with him.
__Penny How was I supposed to know that?
__Sheldon It's all right. I'll see it again with you.
__Leonard And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
__Penny I know, I know.
__Sheldon I can still eat.
__Penny No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.
__Sheldon Okay, but just don't fight
__Leonard We're not fighting.
__Penny Just go.
__Leonard Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
__Sheldon Thank you, Penny.
__Penny You're welcome, sweetie.
__Leonard Want a cup of coffee?
__Penny Oh, um, I should probably get going.
__Penny Yep, okay.
__Howard Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.
__Leonard What am I smelling?
__Penny Sheldon's churro on my shoes.
__Leonard Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
__Penny I think we can do it.
__Leonard Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn't that be wrong?
__Penny No, be friends. You and me.
__Leonard Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
__Penny Good. I'm glad.
__Leonard Here's an idea. I'm just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.
__Penny Good night, Leonard.
__Leonard Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin' around.
__Sheldon No, Goofy, no.
__Raj What?
__Sheldon Explain your sneeze.
__Raj I'm sorry?
__Sheldon Do you have allergies?
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Is there too much pepper on your salad?
__Raj I don't put pepper on salads.
__Sheldon I've heard enough. Sit over there.
__Raj Oh, come on. I don't want to sit by myself.
__Sheldon That's what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.
__Raj Guys, help me.
__Howard Sheldon, come on.
__Leonard Yeah, it's just one sneeze.  You're on your own.
__Howard See you, buddy.
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.
__Leonard When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?
__Sheldon Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.
__Howard Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
__Sheldon Sarcasm?
__Howard Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.
__Sheldon For your information, I'll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.
__Raj The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
__Sheldon Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We've been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she's under consideration for a position at our university.
__Leonard Why didn't you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
__Sheldon I didn't realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you're a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I've been to Toronto.
__Leonard Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?
__Sheldon My room, of course.
__Raj Holy crap!  Holy crap!
__Howard Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.
__Sheldon Go ahead.
__Howard A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
__Sheldon A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.
__Howard So you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
__Leonard Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
__Sheldon When I've seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you'll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.
__Leonard I can't believe he's friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
__Raj I can't believe they let him into Canada.
__Howard Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where's your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.
__ Credits sequence
__Sheldon Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
__Penny What? What are you doing with, what?
__Sheldon The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
__Penny Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?
__Sheldon I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
__Penny Oh. What?
__Sheldon I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.
__Penny Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You're having a woman stay with you?
__Sheldon Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
__Penny Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not flabbergasted. I'm puzzled. Yeah, let's go with puzzled.
__Sheldon A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.
__Penny Female jibber jabber?
__Sheldon Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.
__Penny Oh, they're not my friends.
__Sheldon I'm not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.
__Leonard Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.
__Elizabeth Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I'd written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn't confuse it with what I'd written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‘Cause if I tried to go there, I'd be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Elizabeth Nice to finally meet you in person.
__Sheldon I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
__Leonard Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it's nice to meet you. I've read both your books and most of your papers. I'm Leonard, I live
__ here, you're brilliant.
__ I apologize. He's only an experimental physicist.
__Elizabeth No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. Hi-lo.
__Leonard Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?
__Sheldon No, she's my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
__Elizabeth Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I'd pick the yogurt.
__Sheldon Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.
__Leonard Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don't open, those crazy card-shaped keys.
__Elizabeth I'm so glad you understand.
__Sheldon No, he doesn't understand. I understand.
__Leonard Well, I understand, too.
__Sheldon You're just misappropriating my understanding.
__Leonard Oh,  I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you.
__Sheldon From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
__Elizabeth All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.
__Leonard Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I'm smart.
__Sheldon Get it together, man.
__Elizabeth Good to know.
__Sheldon In here, you'll find emergency provisions. An eight- The Original Series on a high-density flash drive.
__Elizabeth What if there's a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?
__Sheldon Then there's really no reason to live, is there?
__Elizabeth Can I ask a question about your roommate?
__Sheldon He's an odd duck, isn't he?
__Elizabeth What's his relationship status?
__Sheldon Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That's why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you'll find in the bathroom. They're in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.
__Elizabeth Okay.
__Sheldon Good. I'll leave you to your night time ablutions. I've e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You'll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It's on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
__Elizabeth How thoughtful.
__Sheldon Sleep well, my friend.
__Elizabeth You, too.
__Sheldon Oh, let me just get one thing. It's my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn't pass through here. Now, good night. And if there's an apocalypse, good luck.
__Elizabeth I saw your light on.
__Leonard Is everything all right?
__Elizabeth Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.
__Leonard Me neither. Oh, look what I'm reading. It's you.
__Elizabeth I thought you already read it.
__Leonard I did, but it's been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.
__Elizabeth Aw, you're smart.
__Leonard Oh, good. Wasn't sure it was coming across.
__Elizabeth What chapter are you on?
__Leonard Uh, six.
__Elizabeth Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?
__Elizabeth I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.
__Leonard Really? Uh, sure doesn't read that way.
__Elizabeth Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see  a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble's constant.
__Leonard Wow. You really make science come alive.
__Sheldon Morning.
__Elizabeth Morning, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
__Elizabeth More than pleasant.
__Leonard How do you take your coffee?
__Elizabeth Black.
__Leonard Okeydoke.
__Sheldon Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.
__Leonard Something his mother taught him.
__Sheldon All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.
__Elizabeth That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first.
__Sheldon Ah, so the yogurt didn't work. I'll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.
__Penny Oh, good, you're up. Look, my car won't start. I need a ride to work.
__Sheldon Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
__Penny No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.
__Sheldon Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.
__Penny Hello.
__Elizabeth Hi.
__Penny Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn't understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.
__Elizabeth Nice to meet you.
__Penny Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?
__Elizabeth Yes, very much.
__Penny Good.
__Sheldon Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.
__Elizabeth Excuse me.
__Leonard Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It'll be fun. Like a clown car.
__Penny Hang on.
__Leonard Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
__Penny We just broke up.
__Leonard What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?
__Penny Not as good as you apparently.
__Leonard I, um, I don't follow.
__Penny You know what? It's, it's none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon's doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.
__Leonard Well, now…
__Sheldon Excuse me. I'm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.
__Penny I'm not recommending it. I'm saying it already happened.
__Sheldon That's preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.
__Leonard Well…
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Come on. It wasn't my fault.
__Sheldon The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
__Penny You know what? I'm just gonna take the bus to work.
__Leonard Penny, I can still drive you.
__Penny Oh, no, no, it's okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.
__Sheldon I must say, I'm shocked by this betrayal.
__Leonard I didn't betray Penny.
__Sheldon Not Penny, me!
__Leonard How am I betraying you?
__Sheldon Elizabeth's my friend, and you're playing with her!
__Leonard Yeah, I guess I did.
__Raj Relax, it's Nyquil.
__Leonard You still have a cold?
__Raj Maybe, but I don't care. That's the great thing about Nyquil, it's like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.
__Leonard Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night.
__Raj Did you get a cold, too?
__Leonard No, but I was awake all night.
__Howard If you want, I can give you some of my mom's sleeping pills.
__Raj She won't notice they're missing?
__Howard She doesn't know she takes them.
__Leonard No, that's okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn't mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn't mind. Those are your clues.
__Raj Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?
__Leonard No.
__Howard Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?
__Leonard No.
__Howard ‘Cause let me tell you, it's not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart.
__Leonard Okay, I'll give you one more clue. It involved another person.
__Raj Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
__Howard How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
__Raj It is if you love her and give her a name.
__Sheldon Dr. Plimpton, I'd like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
__Raj Hi.
__Sheldon And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
__Howard Hi.
__Raj I'm a big fan of your work.
__Elizabeth Thank you.
__Sheldon And of course, you've already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
__Leonard Hey, you.
__Elizabeth Hey, you.
__Leonard Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?
__Elizabeth You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?
__Leonard Sure. Black, right?
__Elizabeth Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.
__Leonard Coming right up.
__Howard What do you mean what? It's Halo night.
__Raj I can't. I'm too sick. Go away.
__Howard That's why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom's chicken soup.
__Raj I'm not hungry.
__Elizabeth Don't send him away. Let him in.
__Howard Who's that
__Raj I bought a parrot.
__Howard Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?
__Elizabeth Hi. Howard, right?
__Howard Uh, yeah.
__Elizabeth Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?
__Howard Yeah, sure. In fact, I'm a dungeon master.
__Elizabeth Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don't have enough money to pay you. So we'll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.
__Howard Beg pardon?
__Elizabeth You two figure out the details, I'm going to go change into something I don't mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.
__Howard What the frak?
__Howard We broke up weeks ago.
__Raj Why didn't you say anything?
__Howard I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.
__Leonard Hey, who's ready for Halo?
__Raj Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!
__Leonard I don't understand.
__Elizabeth Oh, good. Leonard's here.
__Raj Good?
__Leonard Elizabeth? What's going on?
__Elizabeth What's going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don't have enough money to pay any of you.
__Leonard Is she suggesting what I think she's suggesting?
__Howard Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
__Leonard We'll all be naked in front of each other.
__Howard I'm out.
__Elizabeth Everybody ready?
__Raj Follow my lead. Almost. We're, we're going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.
__Elizabeth Oh, good. It's so much better when everyone commits.
__Raj Run. Run, run, run. Don't look back.
__Leonard I thought we had something special.
__Raj So, you say you can't pay your rent?
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny I found these in the dryer. I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.
__Leonard Thanks. It's really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I've been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.
__Penny You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
__Penny Well, you don't owe me an explanation.
__Leonard I don't?
__Penny No, you don't.
__Leonard So you're not judging me?
__Penny Oh, I'm judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don't owe me an explanation.
__Leonard Nevertheless, I'd like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.
__Penny I'm listening.
__Leonard She let me.
__Leonard It's just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!
__Sheldon Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
__Leonard Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.
__Leonard Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
__Sheldon No, you don't screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.
__Leonard You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.
__Sheldon I don't have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I'm there already!
__Penny Who is it?
__Leonard Leonard.
__Penny Hang on.
__Leonard Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
__Leonard You heard that, huh?
__Penny Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
__Leonard So you agree, he's nuts.
__Penny Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.
__Leonard Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.
__Penny Oh, I do not believe that.
__Leonard You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. ( The lobby) I'd just started at the university.
__Past Leonard Excuse me, I'm looking for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.
__Man with a box Oh, I bet you're here to check out the room for rent.
__Past Leonard Yeah.
__Man Run away, dude.
__Leonard That should have been my first clue.
__Leonard For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.
__Penny Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.
__Leonard Sure, it makes sense now.  Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.
__Large Black Transvestite Yeah?
__Past Leonard Dr. Cooper?
__Transvestite No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.
__Leonard In retrospect, that was clue number two.
__Past Sheldon Yes?
__Past Leonard I'm Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…
__Past Leonard What?
__Past Sheldon You said you're a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?
__Past Leonard Uh, radon?
__Past Sheldon Are you asking me or telling me?
__Past Leonard Telling you? Telling you.
__Past Sheldon All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?
__Past Leonard Oh, uh, well, that's tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.
__Past Sheldon Correct. You've passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.
__Past Leonard Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?
__Past Sheldon That depends.
__Past Leonard I don't understand, their, their existence is conditional?
__Past Sheldon No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.
__Past Leonard There's three?
__Past Sheldon Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.
__Past Leonard Okay.
__Past Sheldon No! That's where I sit!
__Past Leonard What's the difference?
__Past Sheldon This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs.
__Past Leonard Can you do that?
__Past Sheldon Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That's Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.
__Past Leonard Uh, yeah, experimental physics.
__Past Sheldon Hmm.
__Past Leonard What is that?
__Past Sheldon Doesn't concern you. You'll be going to the university every day?
__Past Leonard Yes.
__Past Sheldon And you have a vehicle?
__Past Leonard A car, yeah.
__Past Sheldon And you'll be willing to drive me?
__Past Leonard Well, can't you drive?
__Past Sheldon I can. I choose not to.
__Past Leonard Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that's a point in my favour, right?
__Past Leonard Come on, I just asked.
__Past Sheldon Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?
__Past Leonard Uh, I'm gonna go with preserving the knowledge.
__Past Sheldon That's correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I'll show you the rest of the apartment.
__Past Sheldon The second barrier. Don't get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?
__Past Leonard Uh, I guess.
__Past Sheldon This isn't going to work if you're guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?
__Past Leonard When I have to.
__Past Sheldon When you have to? I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.
__Past Leonard I, I'm sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.
__Past Sheldon I can't give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.
__Past Leonard Fine. I'll take it.
__Past Sheldon Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!
__Past Leonard Is this it?
__Past Sheldon No, this is my room. People don't go in my room.
__Past Leonard So where do you sleep?
__Past Sheldon I don't understand.
__Past Leonard If people don't go in there, and you're people, and… You are people, aren't you? Making a joke.
__Past Sheldon Do you do this often?
__Past Leonard On occasion.
__Past Sheldon Your room. You may want to repaint.
__Penny Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?
__Leonard No, I didn't just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. ( The apartment)
__Past Sheldon Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series Firefly.
__Past Leonard Does that really need to be in the agreement?
__Past Sheldon We might as well settle it now, it's going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that's television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment's flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.
__Past Leonard We have a flag?
__Past Sheldon Never fly it upside down unless the apartment's in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.
__Past Leonard Okay.
__Past Sheldon Well that's disappointing.
__Penny Why on earth did you agree to all that?
__Leonard It was the best apartment I'd seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you've passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.
__Penny Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, it's very hard to feel sympathy for you.
__Leonard Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard's bedroom.)
__Past Sheldon Leonard?
__Past Leonard Shh. Just pretend we're not here.
__Past Sheldon Leonard?Leonard?
__Past Leonard I'm sure he'll go away.
__Past Leonard What do you want? I didn't say come in!
__Past Sheldon You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I'm here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”
__Past Leonard I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.
__Past Leonard But, Joyce, come on.
__Past Sheldon 12 hours?
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Leonard Do I get some sympathy now?
__Penny A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you're doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?
__Leonard Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.
__Penny Why not?
__Leonard Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It's kind of secret.
__Penny What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
__Leonard As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I'm not saying I would have.
__Penny So, what, that's it? You've stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
__Leonard That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
__Penny Oh, yeah, I'm wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.
__Leonard It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work…
__Past Sheldon What is going on here?
__Past Leonard Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.
__Past Howard Hey.
__Past Raj Hey.
__Past Sheldon I'll get to you later. What are you sitting on?
__Past Howard I can't speak for these guys, but I'm sitting on my tushie. It's a joke.
__Past Leonard Yeah, not a good idea.
__Past Raj Tushie is buttocks, right?
__Past Howard Right.
__Past Raj Hilarious.
__Past Sheldon Explain the couch.
__Past Leonard Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
__Past Sheldon But what's wrong with the furniture we have?
__Past Leonard They're lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.
__Past Sheldon Did it occur to you that was by design?
__Past Leonard According to the roommate agreement, I'm entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.
__Past Leonard I did notify you.
__Past Sheldon Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.
__Past Leonard What am I doing in your spam folder?
__Past Sheldon I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.
__Past Raj Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious.
__Penny Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?
__Leonard I'm getting to it.
__Past Sheldon I assure you, you'll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.
__Past Raj Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?
__Past Sheldon Yes.
__Past Howard And you just assume you're always right?
__Past Sheldon It's not an assumption. Change seats with me.
__Past Raj Why?
__Past Sheldon I don't like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.
__Past Raj Fine.
__Past Leonard Ooh, it's time for Babylon 5!
__Past Sheldon We don't watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.
__Past Leonard Why not?
__Past Sheldon Because no one likes Babylon 5.
__Past Leonard I like it.
__Past Raj Me, too.
__Past Howard So do I.
__Past Leonard There you go– three against one.
__Past Sheldon They don't get a vote. It's one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.
__Past Leonard But I said no to that.
__Past Sheldon And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.
__Past Howard Why?
__Past Sheldon There's a draft on my neck over here.
__Past Howard So, I get the draft?
__Past Sheldon You're protected by your turtleneck.
__Past Howard Fine. And it's a dickey.
__Past Sheldon Hmm, I'm still not comfortable. Of course. There's too many people here.
__Past Howard Yeah, we can go over to my place.
__Past Sheldon Wait. Let me get my jacket.
__Past Howard You're not going with us.
__Past Sheldon Why not?
__Past Raj You're the guy we're trying to get away from.
__Past Sheldon Oh. Well, in that case, I don't need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I'm the guy from whom you're trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot.
__Leonard Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?
__Penny Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to Howard's bedroom.)
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, are you having a playdate?
__Past Howard I don't have playdates! I have colleagues!
__Mrs Wolowitz Do their parents know they're here?
__Past Howard No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they'll hear you!
__Past Leonard That your dad?
__Past Howard She grows any more hair on her face, yes.
__Past Leonard Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?
__Past Howard Three. I designed the engine myself.
__Past Raj Cool. Can it break Mach 1?
__Past Howard Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government's been working on.
__Past Leonard Oh, this just might be your lucky day.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!
__Past Howard I haven't seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them!
__Penny So, why was it his lucky day?
__Leonard Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.
__Penny What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
__Leonard Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It's not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.
__Penny Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
__Leonard Yeah, we're really close. Uh, uh, we're at the apartment.
__Past Leonard The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust.
__Past Howard Nice.
__Past Raj Cool.
__Past Sheldon Won't work.
__Past Leonard Excuse me, but I've been working on this a long time. Trust me, it'll work.
__Past Sheldon You don't see your mistake, do you?
__Past Leonard There's no mistake.
__Past Sheldon This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.
__Past Leonard Well, I've adjusted the formula.
__Past Sheldon Not correctly.
__Past Leonard Okay, I've had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh.
__Past Howard What's happening?
__Past Leonard A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!
__Past Howard You're waiting for the elevator?
__Past Leonard Oh. Right.
__Past Raj Wait. It's here.
__Past Sheldon Give me that.
__Past Leonard What'd you do that for? I had plenty of time.
__Past Sheldon You're welcome.
__Leonard Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn't rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.
__Penny Okay, so, basically, you're the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?
__Leonard So I did something stupid. I'm sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
__Penny Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community.
__Past Penny Not pregnant. Yes!
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
__Leonard Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.
__Sheldon There's doubt?
__Leonard I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn't have tried to change it.
__Sheldon That's not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.
__Leonard Okay, I'm sorry.
__Sheldon There you go.
__Leonard So, we're good?
__Sheldon Good what?
__Leonard Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
__Sheldon Go ahead.
__Television voice Up next Babylon 5.
__Sheldon I can hear it!
__Leonard You're insane, you know that?!
__Sheldon Don't make me turn that flag upside down, 'cause you know I'll do it!
__Sheldon I should've brought an umbrella.
__Leonard What for? It's not going to rain.
__Sheldon I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.
__Howard That's a bazinga, right?
__Sheldon One of my best, don't you think?
__Leonard Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.
__Howard You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don't have to peep through windows.
__Raj It's not like that, I'm watching someone's TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.
__Sheldon Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?
__Leonard Relax, it's just a dirty sock.
__Sheldon How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
__Leonard Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.
__Sheldon Not my world.
__Leonard Hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.
__Sheldon I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
__Raj Why don't you ask her to come up?
__Leonard I don't know, it's still a little weird since, you know…
__Howard She dumped you?
__Leonard She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
__Sheldon I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
__Howard Oh, it's very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don't leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.
__Leonard Screw you guys. I'm gonna go see if she's home.
__Howard If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to point this at the moon now.
__Raj Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something's very wrong.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard We're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
__Leonard It's pretty cool. We've got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
__Man in Penny's Apartment Man in Penny' That makes no sense.
__Penny Um…
__Man How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There's no gravity.
__Penny Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.
__Zack Hey.
__Leonard Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Maybe another time.
__Penny Yeah, maybe.
__Zack Hey, I want to see this laser thing.
__Penny Oh, but what about the party?
__Zack It's a surprise party, doesn't matter when we get there.
__Leonard Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how'd you two guys meet?
__Zack My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.
__Leonard Your company?
__Zack Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.
__Leonard So, menus.
__Zack I know it sounds easy but there's a lot of science that goes in designing them.
__Sheldon Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.
__Penny Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.
__Zack Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Zack Whoa! Is that the laser? It's bitchin'.
__Sheldon Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'.
__Zack Well, mission accomplished.
__Penny Oh! That's very cool.
__Zack One question. How can you be sure it won't blow up?
__Leonard The laser?
__Zack The moon.
__Leonard Uh, that's a great question, Zack.
__Sheldon No, it's not.
__Penny Sheldon! Play nice.
__Sheldon Well it's not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon? That's a great question.
__Leonard Don't worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.
__Zack Smart.
__Leonard Now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.
__Zack Naked.
__Leonard Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.
__Zack Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?
__Howard Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
__Sheldon Make it so.
__Howard There it is. There's the spike!
__Leonard 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That's the moon! We hit the moon!
__Zack That's your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?
__Leonard Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.
__Zack What species is that?
__Sheldon I was wrong. Penny can do better.
__Penny Okay, guys, thank you, it's been fun.
__Zack Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?
__Penny No, just keep walking.
__Sheldon He must be very skilled at coitus.
__Howard Horse.
__Raj What?
__Howard The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.
__Raj That's disgusting, dude.
__Howard No, it's not… Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.
__Leonard No, thanks.
__Howard You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.
__Leonard Have they found a match for you?
__Howard Tons. I've had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.
__Sheldon I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.
__Leonard Why not?
__Sheldon All right, let me restate that. It's very heavy, and I don't want to.
__Leonard I'll help you.
__Sheldon Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.
__Raj You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
__Howard Yeah, right.
__Raj No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein's monster was lonely and he found a wife.
__Howard He didn't find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.
__Raj Okay, we'll call that plan B.
__Penny Damn you, you rat bastard.
__Leonard Are you drunk?
__Penny Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!
__Leonard How did I ruin him?
__Penny ‘Cause in the olden days, I never would've known he was so stupid.
__Leonard Come on, he wasn't that stupid.
__Penny Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!
__Leonard Okay, yeah, he's stupid.
__Penny He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
__Leonard How is that my fault?
__Penny You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.
__Penny We're gonna have sex.
__Leonard Why? I mean, okay.
__Sheldon What's going on?
__Penny Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, 'cause it's gonna get loud.
__Sheldon Oh! Not this again.
__Penny What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?
__Sheldon When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I'm making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?
__Penny Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
__Sheldon FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
__Penny Yeah, sorry about that.
__Sheldon As a native Texan, I must say I've never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.
__Penny Oh, God.
__Sheldon Oh, God. That I've heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.
__Leonard How many times have I asked you not to do that?
__Sheldon Counting this instance? 317.
__Leonard Where's Penny?
__Sheldon She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
__Leonard I wonder why she didn't say good-bye.
__Sheldon Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
__Leonard I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.
__Sheldon I have no difficulty believing you're not butter.
__Penny Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.
__Leonard Okay, I'll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?
__Penny Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.
__Leonard Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.
__Penny Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.
__Leonard Doesn't have to be tonight. I'm free pretty much always.
__Penny Leonard, last night was a mistake.
__Leonard When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?
__Penny Look, I'm sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?
__Leonard No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.
__Penny Oh, God!
__Leonard So, that's it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?
__Penny Look, I said I'm sorry. Can't u please let it go?
__Mrs Gunderson Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?
__Howard What?
__Raj We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
__Howard Excuse me?
__Raj The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
__Howard You're kidding. An actual woman?
__Raj Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.
__Howard Trust me, breasts doesn't necessarily mean woman.
__Raj Since when?
__Howard I'll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.
__Leonard Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?
__Raj Do you know what he's talking about?
__Howard Nope. Why don't you ask him?
__Raj Leonard, what are you talking about?
__Leonard I don't want to talk about it.
__Raj That was a lousy suggestion.
__Howard Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…
__Leslie Winkle Hello?
__Leonard Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.
__Leslie Leonard Hofstadter. What're you doing here?
__Leonard Uh, I know! It's been a while!
__Leslie Yeah, 18 months.
__Leonard Right. Right. So how you doing?
__Leslie Fine. You?
__Leonard Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn't mean anything, it was just for fun?
__Leslie Yeah.
__Leonard Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?
__Leslie What happened? Blondie dumped you?
__Leonard She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
__Leslie Right.
__Leonard Um, anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.
__Leslie Uh-huh.
__Leonard So, what do you say?
__Leslie Let me think about it.
__Leonard She's not coming back.
__Howard Not us. Him.
__Raj Yes, but him doesn't even know about her.
__Howard Well, him about to find out about her.
__Raj Really? Us gonna tell him?
__Sheldon Who's going to tell whom about what?
__Howard Sheldon. Hey.
__Raj Hi.
__Sheldon Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
__Howard Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?
__Sheldon Be more specific.
__Howard Four thirty.
__Sheldon That's not afternoon. That's preevning.
__Howard What?
__Sheldon It's a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
__Raj Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?
__Sheldon Well, tomorrow's Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.
__Howard Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?
__Sheldon I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.
__Raj But it's true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Sheldon Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.
__Raj Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.
__Howard Well, come on, where's your scientific curiosity?
__Sheldon Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it's wondering why I'm having this conversation with you.
__Raj Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.
__Sheldon He didn't date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
__Howard Okay, well, why don't you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.
__Sheldon I don't drink coffee.
__Howard All right, you can have a hot chocolate.
__Sheldon As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.
__Howard Why?
__Sheldon What's life without whimsy?
__Howard Okay, I'm out.
__Raj Sheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.
__Sheldon You're bluffing.
__Raj Are you willing to risk it?
__Sheldon Curse you.
__Penny Oh. Hey, Leonard.
__Leonard I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!
__Penny Are you drunk?
__Leonard Come on. We're gonna have sex, and it's not gonna mean a thing!
__Penny Are you out of your mind?!
__Leonard I'm really starting to think there's a double standard here.
__Raj You don't know we're wrong yet.
__Sheldon Haughty derision it is.
__Amy Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldon Cooper.
__Sheldon Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.
__Amy If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I'm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.
__Sheldon Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
__Amy I don't object to the concept of a deity, but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
__Sheldon Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.
__Amy Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.
__Sheldon May I buy you a beverage?
__Amy Tepid water, please.
__Howard Good God, what have we done?
__Leonard Alright.
__Raj Smooth.
__Howard And finally, my moo shu pork.
__Raj Whoo-hoo!
__Howard Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.
__Raj And it only took 28 minutes.
__Sheldon Impressive, but we must be cautious.
__Howard Why?
__Sheldon Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.
__Leonard I don't think that's going to happen, Sheldon.
__Sheldon No one ever does. That's why it happens.
__Penny Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What's that?
__Howard That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.
__Penny Ah, cool.
__Howard Ask me to pass the soy sauce.
__Penny Oh, does that come up much on the space station?
__Howard Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.
__Penny All right. Pass the soy sauce.
__Howard Coming up.
__Leonard So how's work?
__Penny Oh, it's not bad. Kind of hungry.
__Leonard Yeah, we all are.
__Howard Just wait.
__Sheldon You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.
__Penny Really? They're going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
__Sheldon I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?
__Howard Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand.
__Penny Oh ha-ha, oh. That's amazing.
__Sheldon I wouldn't say amazing. At best, it's a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.
__Howard Hey, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Yes?  Peace?
__Howard No, not peace. Hang on.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard You kidding? They still think it's in a secure locker at JPL.
__Penny You stole it?
__Howard Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Oh. Amy's at the dry cleaners, and she's made a very amusing pun. “I don't care for perchloroethylene, and I don't like glycol ether.” Get it? She doesn't like glycol ether. Sounds like either.  L-O-L.
__Penny Who's Amy?
__Leonard His girlfriend.
__Penny Sheldon has a girlfriend?
__Sheldon She's not my girlfriend.
__Penny How long has this been going on?
__Leonard Four months.
__Sheldon She's not my girlfriend.
__Penny Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what's new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?
__Sheldon She's not my girlfriend.
__Penny Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?
__Penny Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.
__Howard Or, as we call them, Shamy.
__Penny Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.
__Sheldon All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.
__Penny Okay, well, what do you communicate about?
__Sheldon Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you're considering having a baby?
__Sheldon Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.
__Penny Okay, I have a question.
__Sheldon Yes, Penny.
__Penny You don't even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
__Sheldon Why on Earth would we have sex?
__Penny Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?
__Sheldon I'm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.
__Penny Oh, God.
__Sheldon Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?
__Leonard Still digging the Shamy?
__Penny Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don't know, maybe actually spending some time with her.
__Sheldon You mean dating?
__Penny Yeah.
__Penny Why not?
__Sheldon She's not my girlfriend.
__Penny Okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.
__Sheldon Oh. I hadn't considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don't think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
__Sheldon Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
__Penny You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
__Sheldon I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
__Penny Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.
__Sheldon If you're looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we're having right now.
__Penny What do you want?
__Sheldon I've decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Penny Oh, that's great. Have fun.
__Sheldon Wait. You have to drive me.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon You know I don't drive.
__Penny Well, go ask Leonard.
__Sheldon I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.
__Penny Leonard said cockamamie?
__Sheldon Actually, I'm paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I'm uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I'm not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.
__Penny Okay, fine. When's the date?
__Sheldon Now.
__Penny Now?
__Sheldon Hurry. We're going to be late.
__Penny Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Do you have other plans?
__Penny Well, no, not per se, but…
__Sheldon So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
__Penny Let me get my cockamamie keys.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, dinner's ready!
__Howard I'll eat later. I'm busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.
__Penny You're welcome.
__Sheldon I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops. It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
__Penny Sheldon.
__Sheldon Sorry. I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
__Penny Can I ask you a question?
__Sheldon Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.
__Penny Yeah. Well, my question is, and I'm pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?
__Sheldon That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Then, this is my first date.
__Penny Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things you should probably know.
__Sheldon I have a master's degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.
__Penny My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.
__Sheldon If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?
__Penny Fair point.
__Leonard Yeah?
__Raj Where does he poop?
__Leonard What?
__Raj What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?
__Leonard Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what's going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what?  You're not going to believe this.
__Amy Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.
__Penny Yeah, it's okay.
__Amy But the light indicates…
__Sheldon Don't bother. I've wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
__Penny Um, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells great.
__Penny Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.
__Amy Are you a homosexual?
__Penny No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.
__Amy Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
__Penny Guys, how 'bout some music?
__Sheldon Oh, no, I wouldn't care for that. Amy?
__Amy No, thank you.
__Penny Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?
__Sheldon No.
__Penny Well, why don't you tell her?
__Sheldon All right. It was hell.
__Penny Any follow up, Amy?
__Amy No.
__Penny I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.
__Penny I don't know. I was just trying something.
__Howard Yes.
__Raj Penis first?
__Howard Yes. Now, help me!
__Leonard I'd suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.
__Howard Not funny, Leonard.
__Raj Really? A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk, dude. That's funny, ask anyone.
__Howard Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!
__Leonard Okay, let's see.
__Howard No, no! Don't touch, the program is paused.
__Leonard Well, then let's un-pause it.
__Howard No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it's gonna start twisting.
__Raj A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.
__Leonard You do what you want, I'm not touching another man's honey tree.
__Raj All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?
__Howard What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
__Howard Okay, I can't believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.
__Leonard Well, then what do you want us to do?
__Howard I…
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!
__Howard That's great, Mom, thanks!
__Mrs Wolowitz I'll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!
__Howard Don't come up here!
__Mrs Wolowitz Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!
__Howard Yes, but that's not the point! Get me out of here.
__Leonard You have any ideas, Raj?
__Raj Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.
__Sheldon Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It's over 14 hours in Southern California.
__Amy That's an amusing factoid.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon's first official date. Discuss.
__Amy Is this true?
__Sheldon Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn't count.
__Penny So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?
__Amy Once a year. It's a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?
__Penny Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many. A few. (Sheldon laugh's strangely). What's (imitates Sheldon's laugh)
__ Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
__Penny What? Where did you get 171 men?
__Sheldon Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I've known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…
__Penny Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. 16?
__Penny 14.
__Amy Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
__Penny Oh.
__Sheldon Based on the number of awkward encounters I've had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she's returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…
__Penny Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.
__Sheldon So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let's round that up to 31.
__Penny Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I'm gonna need a drink over here.
__Amy This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?
__Penny No! No! No. Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?
__Sheldon This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
__Amy Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
__Amy Then 128.
__Howard Don't tug. No tugging.
__Raj Next time, take your own advice.
__Leonard Excuse me, could you help us out?
__Nurse My, my, my. What do we have here?
__Howard I slipped and fell.
__Nurse Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?
__Howard It's a robot arm.
__Nurse Where's the rest of the robot?
__Howard I only built the arm.
__Nurse ‘Cause that's all you needed, right?
__Howard Can you please just help me?
__Nurse All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm.  I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man's penis out here.
__Howard You think you could be a little more discreet?
__Nurse I'm sorry, we don't have a code for robot hand grasping a man's penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?
__Leonard Uh, it's what controls the arm.
__Howard But it's frozen.
__Nurse Did you try turning it off and back on again?
__Howard No, you see, it's more complicated than that.  No, wait!  Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.
__Raj Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
__Sheldon I'll be happy to check the math, but numbers don't lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.
__Penny And that is?
__Sheldon Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
__Penny You're still on that?
__Sheldon In these uncertain times, doesn't humanity deserve a gift?
__Penny Okay, you know what? I'm gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I'm gonna tell your mother on you.
__Sheldon That's no threat. My mother's always wanted a grandchild.
__Penny Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
__Sheldon Curses.
__Penny If I'd thought of that in the first place, I could've saved myself this whole night.
__Sheldon Well, it's not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.
__Leonard Hey, Howard, what's up?
__Sheldon I've decided not to procreate.
__Leonard Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?
__Sheldon The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die.
__Leonard A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
__Sheldon My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.
__Leonard Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What's KBB?
__Sheldon Killed by badger.
__Leonard How's that?
__Sheldon It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there's a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.
__Leonard I don't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
__Sheldon Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA?
__Leonard You can always get a badger and find out.
__Sheldon But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.
__Leonard That long, huh?
__Sheldon 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
__Leonard What's there?
__Sheldon The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.
__Leonard So, you're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
__Sheldon By this much.
__Leonard Tough break. You want eggs?
__Sheldon You don't get it, Leonard. I'm going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus.
__Leonard What's a dogapus?
__Leonard Is somebody working on that?
__Sheldon I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
__Leonard Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
__Sheldon A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard It came to $28.17. Let's say six bucks apiece.
__Howard Here you go.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Never mind. I got it.
__Penny Oh, you wanted me to pay.
__Leonard It's no big deal.
__Penny No, no, no, no. You're right. We're not going out anymore, I should pay for myself.  What?
__Howard He said if he had woman parts, he'd eat for free the rest of his life.
__Penny Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself. I'm a little low on cash.
__Leonard Hmm? How much you got?
__Penny Nothing.
__Penny I'm cute. I get by.
__Leonard It's okay, you can owe me.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Sheldon, six bucks.
__Sheldon No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.
__Penny But it's Thursday. Thursday's pizza night.
__Sheldon Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight's selection, brussels sprouts.
__Howard Really? You're changing the Sheldonian calendar?
__Sheldon It's a small price to pay.
__Penny For what?
__Leonard No, no, don't ask.
__Penny Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
__Sheldon In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.
__Penny Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?
__Sheldon Correct.
__Penny So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
__Sheldon Essentially, yes.
__Penny Okay, here's my question. Didn't you already do that?
__Sheldon Flattering, but sadly, no. I'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.
__Penny Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?
__Sheldon That's an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.
__Penny No, it won't. Um, how does he know I jog?
__Howard Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.
__Penny Oh, my God, that is so creepy!
__Howard I know!  And he says he's not gonna stop.  Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
__Leonard What the hell? What's the matter?
__Sheldon I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I'm nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
__Leonard There's no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
__Sheldon Well, if it's not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
__Leonard When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
__Sheldon It's part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!
__Leonard Have you had your appendix out?
__Sheldon I haven't. I've been meaning to, but who has the time?
__Leonard Let's get you to the hospital.
__Sheldon So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon I do. And yet I'm doomed while you live on.
__Leonard Funny how things work out, isn't it?
__Sheldon Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst!  On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.
__Leonard Good night.
__Sheldon Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
__Sheldon Thank you. They're my mother's.
__Penny Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?
__Sheldon No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday, but it's nice when things work out. Where's your heart rate monitor?
__Penny I don't have one.
__Sheldon What about your pedometer?
__Penny Don't have one.
__Sheldon Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
__Penny Uh, no.
__Sheldon What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?
__Penny No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.
__Sheldon Why are you doing that?
__Penny It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny All right, let's start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.
__Sheldon I am doing it.
__Penny Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?
__Sheldon We'll never know.
__Penny Okay, let's just warm up on the run.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Penny Okay, let's go.
__Sheldon Yeah, I've been reading up on biomechanics. I think you'll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!
__Penny Oh, my God, are you okay?
__Sheldon I think so.
__Penny Oh, let me help you up.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Sheldon If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.
__Howard Thank you, sir.
__Leonard Palak paneer, that's Penny.
__Penny Thanks.
__Leonard And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.
__Penny Hey, what's my share?
__Leonard Uh, 12 bucks.
__Penny Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?
__Leonard Sure.
__Penny What am I up to now?
__Penny What now?
__Howard He's just expressing his admiration that you don't even have to put out to get free stuff.
__Penny It's not free, I'm gonna pay him back.  Shut up!
__Leonard Sheldon, are you gonna join us?
__Sheldon Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon's face, appears). Greetings, friends.
__Leonard Greetings, whatever the hell you are.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.
__Howard Really? That's your question? When did he put a ramp in?
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- You're in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you'll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.
__Penny Yeah, to be honest, I don't see much difference.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Thank you. That's what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you'll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.
__Leonard This is ridiculous. I'm coming to talk to you.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- You don't know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.
__Leonard You're in your bedroom.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- No, I'm not.
__Leonard I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- No, you can't. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!
__Penny So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.
__Sheldon I'm behind you. Please look at me when you're talking to me.
__Leonard I am looking at you.
__Sheldon No, you're not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.
__Leonard You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.
__Sheldon At my age, do you know how I'm statistically most likely to die?
__Leonard At the hands of your roommate?
__Sheldon An accident.
__Leonard That's how I'm going to make it look.
__Sheldon Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.
__Leonard Fine, but don't expect my help.
__Sheldon You have to help, it's in the roommate agreement.
__Leonard No, it's not.
__Sheldon Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
__Leonard I'll be damned.
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- It's much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
__Leonard Refresh my memory. Why didn't I just put you in the trunk?
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Because I called shotgun. Remember?
__Leonard Right.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.
__Leonard I don't want to listen to music, Sheldon.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Very well. I don't understand why you're not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we're like Knight Rider.
__Leonard I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Perhaps you'd be interested in a different game.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I've introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I'll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.
__Leonard That's it. Bye-bye.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Bazinga.
__Leonard Whoa!
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- I have an override switch.
__Leonard I almost died!
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- And I'm safe and sound in bed. Who's crazy now?
__Leonard I'm still going to go with you.
__Leonard What about it?
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- Be a lamb and open it for me.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- You think you have me stymied, don't you?
__Leonard No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.
__Howard Oh, look, it's Leonard and R2-D-Bag.
__Raj That's my joke. I told it last night. You can't just use it.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.
__Raj Oh, sure.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- He's a lamb. You're not.
__Raj I'm a lamb.
__Howard I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
__Raj That's two, dude. Write your own jokes.
__Penny Oh, great. Hi, I'm Penny, I'll be your waitress.
__Leonard Why are you introducing yourself?
__Penny I'd rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- Can you tell me the specials this evening?
__Penny Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Obviously. I don't even have water yet.
__Penny Because you're not here.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- That's discrimination against the otherwise located. I'm going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.
__Howard Is that Steve Wozniak?
__Leonard I think it is.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- The Great and Powerful Woz.
__Leonard Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…
__Penny Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- I must speak to him.
__Leonard Of course you must.
__Penny You know, there's an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?
__Steve Wozniak Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- Thank you. I just want to say I'm a big fan. You're my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
__Steve Wozniak Only fifteenth?
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- It's still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
__Steve Wozniak Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.
__Steve Wozniak Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I'd autograph it for you.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.
__Steve Wozniak Nerds.
__Penny What up, Shel-Bot?
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- I can't get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.
__Penny What do you want me to do?
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Sing me Soft Kitty.
__Penny Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- Closer to the microphone.
__Penny Happy kitty, sleepy…
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- No. You have to start over.
__Penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
__Amy In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?
__Sheldon Uganda.
__Amy Defend.
__Sheldon Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.
__Amy Correct. My turn.
__Amy Tuned bayonets.
__Sheldon Defend.
__Amy Isn't it obvious?
__Sheldon You're right. My apologies.
__Leonard What the hell are you guys playing?
__Sheldon It's a game we invented. It's called Counterfactuals.
__Amy We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
__Sheldon It's fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
__Leonard All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
__Leonard Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don't know.
__Sheldon Leonard, be serious. We're playing a game here.
__Leonard I can figure this out, let's see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I'll say cinnamon.
__Sheldon Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.
__Amy In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?
__Leonard This is ridiculous. You're just making stuff up.
__Amy Is he always like this when he loses?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. You should've been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.
__Leonard You bumped the table and you know it.
__Amy Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
__Leonard I'm going to my room.
__Amy Very good, Leonard. But next time, don't tell us where you're hiding.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
__Leonard What?
__Raj Don't ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.
__Howard On the potty? What are you, five?
__Raj It's a potty. What do you call it?
__Howard Toilet.
__Raj That's a little vulgar for the dinner table, don't you think?
__Howard Oh, and potty is okay?
__Raj Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
__Howard What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?
__Raj If I don't have to boom-boom.
__Sheldon Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Leonard Sure.
__Howard Nice to see you.
__Amy Hello.
__Sheldon Sorry we're late.
__Amy I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
__Howard Ah, ah.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon I believe she's experiencing her menses.
__Amy Actually, I'm not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.
__Leonard Ah, ah.
__Howard Okay. Toilet's sounding pretty good now, huh?
__Penny Hey, look, it's Shamy.
__Amy Shamy?
__Sheldon A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy.
__Amy Oh. I don't like that. Don't do that.
__Penny All righty. What's new?
__Amy Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don't like that.
__Penny I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how's your life?
__Amy Like everybody else's. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?
__Sheldon I should've warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.
__Amy Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
__Sheldon It's how they lure you in. I believe it's called bait and switch.
__Penny Okay, I'm just gonna walk away, 'cause I don't want to be here.
__Leonard So, this is nice. First time we've all gotten together to eat.
__Amy You're right, he's a festival of humdrum chitchat.
__Leonard Okay, that's all I got. Howard, you're up.
__Howard Um, tell us about your work, Amy.
__Amy I doubt you'd understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master's degree.
__Howard Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?
__Amy I'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.
__Sheldon They can't function without me. I'm the social glue that holds this little group together. You're welcome.
__Sheldon She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl and she's my friend, but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.
__Leonard Got it.
__Sheldon Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It's an action we both regret to this day.
__Leonard Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm not sure she's the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.
__Sheldon Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I've always been more of an empire man.
__Leonard Yeah, not my point.
__Sheldon I know what your point is. You're intimidated by Amy's intellect. To that I say, buck up.
__Leonard Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.
__Sheldon So?
__Leonard So we already have you for all that.
__Sheldon Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
__Leonard No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.
__Sheldon May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.
__Leonard Suffered in silence?
__Sheldon Yes. And I'd thank you to do the same.
__Leonard Really? Silence?
__Howard Philadelphia.
__Raj Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
__Howard Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?
__Raj Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.
__Penny So this is the plan? From now on, we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?
__Raj I'm very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?
__Penny Get one yourself.
__Raj Ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.
__Penny God, he's an ass when he drinks.
__Howard Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't. You just don't hear it.
__Leonard I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
__Raj Well, if that's the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.
__Leonard I did.
__Penny Well, what'd he say?
__Leonard Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.
__Penny Kinda, sorta had to?
__Leonard I didn't agree with him.
__Penny Well, you defended me, right?
__Leonard I tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.
__Howard You're not doing that right.
__Penny What?
__Howard Gimme.
__Penny No.
__Howard Trust me.
__Penny No!
__Howard I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.
__Penny Wow, that is better.
__Leonard I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny's beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.
__Raj I was homesick.
__Howard The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills.
__Raj That's very offensive.
__Howard Yeah, we all thought so.
__Leonard Oh, no.
__Howard What?
__Leonard John and Yoko.
__Sheldon Greetings.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I'm doing.
__Amy It's very impressive, for theoretical work.
__Sheldon Do I detect a hint of condescension?
__Amy I'm sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what's the word I'm looking for? Hmm, cute.
__Leonard and Howard together Oooh!
__Sheldon Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
__Sheldon You take that back.
__Amy Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it's better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.
__Leonard I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…
__Sheldon Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.
__Amy Yes, but if I'm successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.
__Sheldon That's the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!
__Amy We appear to have reached an impasse.
__Sheldon I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
__Amy Seconded.
__Sheldon There being no objections…
__All No, uh-uh.
__Sheldon The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Amy Good day, Sheldon Cooper.
__Howard Women, huh? Can't live with them, can't successfully refute their hypotheses.
__Sheldon Amen to that.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny I hear you broke up with Amy.
__Sheldon A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
__Penny Wow. That's like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?
__Sheldon Regarding what?
__Penny Amy.
__Sheldon I don't follow.
__Penny Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.
__Sheldon Penny, I assure you, I'm fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I'm continuing on with my life as before.
__Penny Okay. Good.
__Sheldon Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy a pussycat.
__Leonard No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.
__Howard Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I'm worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.
__Raj What does hit a reef mean?
__Leonard Uh, went splitsville.
__Raj Pardon?
__Leonard Turned to boom-boom.
__Raj Ah.
__Leonard I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
__Howard You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.
__Leonard He got a cat to keep him company.
__Raj You're kidding.
__Leonard He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.
__Raj He takes the kitty to the potty?
__Howard I thought we discussed the P-word.
__Raj Don't try to change me, dude. I am what I am.
__Sheldon Oh, gentlemen.
__Howard Hey. Aren't you going to introduce us to your little friend?
__Sheldon My apologies. Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.
__Howard Hello.
__Raj Hi.
__Sheldon Now, if you'll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.
__Howard Okay, I get it. We're worried about Sheldon.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
__Leonard So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
__Sheldon Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.
__Leonard Zazzles?
__Sheldon I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he's so zazzy.
__Leonard Okay, we need to talk.
__Sheldon About what?
__Leonard Cats, Sheldon. You're clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.
__Sheldon Clowder.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
__Leonard Okay, yeah, fine.
__Sheldon It's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
__Sheldon It wasn't a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
__Leonard Okay, I got it, I got it, she's not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
__Leonard She didn't dump me. It was mutual!
__Sheldon I was there. She dumped you.
__Leonard Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.
__Sheldon You don't have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I'm already a fan. All right, fellas, who's in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that's not fancy at all.
__Mrs Cooper Where is he?
__Leonard He's in his bedroom.
__Mrs Cooper Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?
__Leonard No, she's real.
__Mrs Cooper Did they sin?
__Leonard No, no, it's not like that. It's, uh, I don't know what it's like. But there is something I should prepare you for.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I've seen him at his best, I've seen him at his worst. There's nothing he can do that'll surprise me.
__Leonard Hold on to that thought. (Knocks on Sheldon's bedroom door)
__Sheldon Come in.
__Leonard Surprise.
__Sheldon Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.
__Mrs Cooper My, my, that's a powerful smell.
__Sheldon I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…
__Sheldon What are you doing here?
__Mrs Cooper Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.
__Sheldon Oh, that's preposterous. I'm not pining over anyone.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it's creepy.
__Sheldon I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don't argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.
__Mrs Cooper You should have called sooner.
__Sheldon Coming!
__Mrs Cooper No cats!
__Sheldon Aw. What is she doing here?
__Mrs Cooper I called her.
__Amy Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.
__Sheldon Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.
__Leonard 25 cats!
__Mrs Cooper Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.
__Sheldon All right, but you're not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.
__Mrs Cooper Then stop talking.
__Sheldon Yes, ma'am.
__Mrs Cooper Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.
__Sheldon That's a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I've ever met.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly, I can't see it.
__Sheldon Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can't see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they're there.
__Amy Excellent point.
__Sheldon A physics point.
__Amy Touche.
__Mrs Cooper Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it's a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn't have to end it for you.
__Sheldon Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.
__Amy I'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
__Sheldon I'll go as high as 40.
__Amy Sixty-five.
__Sheldon Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?
__Amy I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
__Sheldon Would you like to see my cats?
__Amy I would. I love cats. They're the epitome of indifference.
__Sheldon Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.
__Leonard I saw what you did there.
__Mrs Cooper He thinks he's such a smarty pants. He's no different from any man. You tell 'em not to do something, that's all they want to do. If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we'd still be calling him Edward. Now, don't you move. I'll bring over all the food.
__Leonard No, no, no, I can do it.
__Mrs Cooper Well, isn't that sweet?
__Amy Next!
__Sheldon Thank you, Amy. Here's your cat. And here's your $20.
__Amy Next!
__Sheldon Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you'd be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.
__Raj Oh, you're so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.
__Sheldon You're wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.
__Howard I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.
__Leonard Yeah, it's like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.
__Raj Has it occurred to you you're missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
__Sheldon Oh, Penny? Penny?
__Penny What's up?
__Sheldon Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
__Howard No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.
__Penny Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me. Howard won't order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard's lactose intolerant, so he can't eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.
__Leonard Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
__Penny You want the fruit platter?
__Leonard Does it have melon on it?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard No, I can't eat melon.
__Penny Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.
__Leonard When was the last time you saw her?
__Howard Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant?
__Bernadette Hi, guys.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
__Raj It's one of his best moves.
__ Credits sequence.
__Katee Sackhoff Hello, Howard. I've missed you.
__Howard I've missed you, Katee Sackhoff.
__Katee Sackhoff One question.
__Howard Anything.
__Katee Sackhoff Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?
__Howard Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.
__Katee Sackhoff Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you.
__Howard Okay, if you insist.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, have you seen my girdle?!
__Howard No, Ma!
__Mrs Wolowitz I can't find it, and I'm late for my Weight Watchers meeting!
__Howard Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?
__Bernadette I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
__Howard Bernadette? What are you doing here?
__Katee Sackhoff Well, if I had to guess, I'd say I'm here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you're still hung up on me.
__Howard No, I'm not.
__Bernadette Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we'd be done by now.
__Howard Okay, I'm a little confused here.
__George Takei Oh, my. Can I help?
__Howard Not that kind of confused.
__Bernadette What's George Takei doing here?
__Howard No, of course not.
__George Takei So you say. Yet, here I am.
__Katee Sackhoff George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?
__George Takei It's difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O'Neill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain.
__Katee Sackhoff Tell me about it. It's frackin' frustrating.
__Howard Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?
__Bernadette She's leaving because you really want to be with me.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!
__Howard Great, Ma!
__Mrs Wolowitz I think it shrunk! I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!
__Howard And with that mental picture, I think we're done for the evening.
__Howard I did a stupid thing.
__Leonard Yeah, I guessed that.
__Howard It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
__Leonard That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.
__Howard No. Stop asking.
__Leonard All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you're too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.
__Howard In a nutshell.
__Leonard Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you.
__Howard Now, you see, I don't know if you're kidding or not.
__Raj You're being unreasonable. Why can't I have a desk?
__Sheldon Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don't need desks.
__Raj You have a desk.
__Sheldon Correct.
__Sheldon You're two for two.
__Leonard Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it's convenient, there's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.
__Raj Oh, but there's money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Howard Okay, what if he buys his own desk?
__Raj Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?
__Sheldon That's ridiculous.
__Howard Why?
__Sheldon Because…
__Raj Yes?
__Sheldon It's my office.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.
__Raj And I can put it in your office?
__Sheldon Well, you really want to dot the I's and cross the T's, don't you?
__Leonard Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
__Sheldon They do some of their best work at night.
__Sheldon Penny?  Penny?  Penny? (Penny opens door. Howard is stood outside with a hand-held voice recorder.) Penny?
__Howard Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
__Penny Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
__Howard I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
__Penny Oh, absolutely.
__Howard She does?
__Penny Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?
__Howard She saw that, huh?
__Penny Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.
__Howard Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?
__Penny Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we're on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?
__Howard Oh, I'd rather not say.
__Penny Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.
__Howard But it's embarrassing.
__Penny Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.
__Howard Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?
__Penny Um, the online game? Sure.
__Howard Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?
__Penny Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.
__Howard Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.
__Penny Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.
__Howard Would you talk to her?
__Penny Bernadette or the troll?
__Howard Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story.
__Penny Well, what was your side?
__Howard Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn't even a real woman. I mean, she could've been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.
__Penny Really? And that didn't make her feel better?
__Penny Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.
__Howard No. Why would you? I'm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.
__Penny Okay, I will think about it.
__Howard You know, I've always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn't the son he wanted.
__Penny Yeah, I said I'd think about it.
__Howard I wasn't athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.
__Penny Okay, fine. Look, look, I'm calling her now! See?
__Howard Thank you.
__Sheldon One question.
__Leonard Yeah?
__Sheldon Why on earth are you telling me all this?
__Leonard I don't know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you're not a real boy.
__ You said I could buy a desk.
__Sheldon This isn't a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
__Raj Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?
__Sheldon It's actually British.
__Raj Can you say it again for me?
__Sheldon Brobdingnagian.
__Sheldon Brobdingnagian.
__Raj Now three times fast?
__Sheldon Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?
__Raj That's for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.
__Sheldon All right, you've made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.
__Sheldon All right, if you're not going to remove it, I'll remove it for you.
__Sheldon Help me move my desk.
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj No. It's too Brobdingnagian.
__Sheldon Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
__Raj Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I'd say it's spot-on.
__Sheldon All right, I see what's going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.
__Raj Thank you.
__Sheldon Stand by for my upcoming tat.
__Raj Hey, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Yes?
__Raj No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
__Bernadette Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?
__Howard Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I'm terrified of the ocean.
__Bernadette Too bad.
__Howard You wouldn't know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy's large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?
__Bernadette Well, to be honest, I…
__Penny Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?
__Howard Not for me, thanks.
__Bernadette I'm okay.
__Penny Are you gonna want to order food?
__Howard Maybe later.
__Penny Okay.
__Howard So, are you seeing anybody?
__Bernadette No.
__Penny That's what I told him when he asked me. I hope that's not out of line.
__Bernadette No, it's fine.
__Howard Penny, can we have a little privacy?
__Penny Oh. I'm sorry.
__Bernadette What about you, have you been seeing anybody?
__Howard Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…
__Bernadette So you've been seeing other girls?
__Howard Well, not real girls.
__Bernadette Does that mean slutty trolls?
__Penny You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__ Oh, sorry. Yeah, you're right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?
__Howard Isn't there somewhere else you can be?
__Penny Not where I can hear you guys.
__Howard Okay, fine. I'll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I've ever gone there is because I don't have a real woman in my life. You happy?
__Penny Yeah, that'll hold me for a while.
__Bernadette Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll's brains out.
__Howard Yeah, but we weren't, I-I mean, you and I never…
__Bernadette Had sex?
__Howard Yeah.
__Bernadette Well, whose fault was that?
__Penny Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
__Bernadette Well, we could've been having sex, but you never made the move.
__Howard I didn't think you wanted me to make the move.
__Bernadette Howard, a girl doesn't go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she's not expecting him to eventually make the move.
__Howard Really?
__Howard Son of a bitch.
__Penny Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can't actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you're ready.
__Leonard Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?
__Howard Did Penny tell you about that?
__Leonard No. Steve Patterson told me.
__Howard The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Howard How'd he know about it?
__Leonard He's Glissinda the troll.
__Raj Sorry, dude, the thermostat's on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!
__Sheldon I'll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
__Raj Oh, too bad! Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!
__Sheldon That's it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
__Raj Eat flaming Nerf!
__Leonard So anyway, that's great news about you and Bernadette.
__Howard Yeah. I think I'm gonna take her to miniature golf.
__Leonard Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that's like regular golf.
__Howard Short jokes? Really? You're, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.
__Leonard Yeah, and don't you forget it.
__Bernadette Me, too.
__Katee Sackhoff Kiss her good night. All right, now a little tongue.
__George Takei Hold on there. We've only just rekindled the romance. Let's not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.
__Katee Sackhoff Don't listen to him. She wants it. Tongue. Luh-luh-luh-luh-luh. See? Now make the move.
__George Takei Mm-mmm. Too soon.
__Katee Sackhoff Trust me, she's ready. Make the move.
__George Takei No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed, courted slowly.
__Katee Sackhoff How would you know?
__George Takei I read.
__Katee Sackhoff Listen to me, Howard, it's time. Make the move, now.
__Bernadette Mm! What are you doing?
__Howard You said, well, the move, remember?
__Bernadette Oh, not now. We're starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.
__Howard No, you don't. It's me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.
__Bernadette Be patient, we'll get there.
__George Takei Told you.
__Sheldon Yes?
__Leonard What are you doing in there?
__Sheldon I'm making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
__Sheldon Well, we'll just see how long you can hold out.
__Raj Well, we'll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.
__Leonard Didn't you say you're making hydrogen sulphide gas?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Isn't that flammable?
__Sheldon Highly. Oh, dear.
__Raj This is not over.
__Sheldon That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She'll appreciate the witticism.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon It'll also help improve her initial impression of you.
__Leonard So what's going on with you two?
__Sheldon Well, the status is as it always was. She's a girl. She's a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.
__Leonard Right, right. So you're still just texting and emailing? You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?
__Sheldon Leonard, you are my best friend. I've known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Sheldon I sense judgment on your part.
__Leonard No, no. Maybe a little.
__Sheldon May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
__Leonard Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
__Sheldon I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
__Leonard Oh, right. That.
__Sheldon Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.
__Leonard I'm not jealous.
__Sheldon Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Probably. What's your point?
__Sheldon No point. It's just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?
__Leonard Hmm, recently? Not much.
__Sheldon Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?
__Leonard Um, shut up.
__Sheldon You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It's very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.
__Leonard That sounds lovely.
__Sheldon It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm just not dating someone right now. I don't need to go to a senior centre.
__Sheldon Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.
__Leonard Fine. If I don't meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.
__Sheldon It's not a home. It's a senior centre.  We'd never put Meemaw in a home!
__Howard Hey.
__Raj Hey.
__Sheldon All right, I'll bow to social pressure. Hey!
__Howard Excuse me. That's my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.
__Raj When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.
__Leonard You realize he's just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don't.
__Rai You mean, you don't.
__Leonard You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can't even speak to women.
__Raj Two words, deaf chick. It doesn't matter if I can't talk, because she can't hear me.
__Leonard What?
__Raj That's what she said.
__Leonard Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard's got a girlfriend, Sheldon's got a girl…
__Sheldon No, no, no, no!
__Leonard …who's a friend.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Leonard What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?
__Stuart Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.
__Leonard Oh. Well, good for you.
__Stuart Not really. She's horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?
__Leonard Why don't you just break up with her?
__Stuart No, no, I can't.
__Leonard Why not?
__Stuart ‘Cause then I'd be alone, like you.
__Raj Dude, why don't you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?
__Raj Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women's correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.
__Leonard You're saying I couldn't get laid in a women's prison with a handful of pardons.
__Raj Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Are you ill?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Are you still depressed because you're alone, and no one loves you?
__Leonard I don't know. Maybe.
__Sheldon I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being.
__Sheldon You're welcome. But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
__Amy May I offer an observation?
__Leonard What the hell? How long has she been here?
__Sheldon Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
__Leonard That was two hours ago.
__Sheldon As per your suggestion, we're hanging out. Quite frankly, I don't see what all the hoopla's about. Go on, Amy.
__Amy From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.
__Sheldon Did you know that, Leonard?
__Sheldon I did.
__Amy I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?
__Leonard No, I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.
__Sheldon Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one's liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?
__Leonard Right.
__Amy That's not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.
__Sheldon Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?
__Leonard Keep going. I'm listening.
__Amy That was rude.
__Sheldon He does it all the time. He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
__Amy Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.
__Sheldon Let's make that our word of the day.
__Amy Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.
__Sheldon Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.
__Amy Wait. I have a request.
__Sheldon Yes?
__Amy I'd like you to meet my mother.
__Sheldon I see. Can I get back to you on that?
__Amy Certainly. Good night.
__Sheldon Good night.  Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
__ Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
__ Yeah, what?
__Sheldon Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
__Leonard Yeah. So?
__Sheldon What does that mean?
__Leonard Well, you know how you're always saying that Amy is a girl who's your friend, and not your girlfriend?
__Sheldon Uh-huh.
__Leonard You can't say that anymore.
__Sheldon Wait. What?
__Leonard Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.
__Sheldon I don't want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
__Leonard Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?
__Sheldon Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone's girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.
__Leonard That is insane.
__Sheldon You're right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
__Leonard Okay, good luck.
__Sheldon Wait! What am I supposed to do?
__Leonard Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?
__Sheldon Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a hippie.
__Leonard All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
__Leonard There you go.
__Sheldon Amy's right. He is tedious.
__Howard Why can't you get it?
__Mrs Wolowitz You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I'm like an upside-down volcano here.
__Howard Oh, hey. I hope you didn't hear that.
__Howard What's with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?
__Leonard No, it's just something I threw on.
__Howard I know all your shirts. That's not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren't you?
__Leonard Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don't guard the shirts.
__Howard So, how'd it go?
__Leonard It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.
__Howard Just FYI, don't try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.
__Leonard I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.
__Howard You that desperate?
__Leonard No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.
__Mrs Wolowitz Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?
__Leonard To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.
__Howard Yeah, I know what you mean.
__Sheldon As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.
__Leonard What are you working on?
__Sheldon I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me and compel me to meet her mother.
__Leonard Ah, you're going off the grid.
__Sheldon Exactly.
__Leonard The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
__Sheldon Thank you. I've also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
__Leonard What if she just comes over?
__Sheldon She'll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
__Sheldon Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.
__Leonard Who is it?
__Amy Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Sheldon Darn! She found me!
__Leonard She's been here before.
__Sheldon The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.
__Leonard What do you want to do?
__Sheldon Tell her I'm not here.
__Sheldon I don't know. You'll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.
__Leonard Hi, Amy. Sheldon's not here.
__Amy All right.
__Sheldon Way to go on the details.
__Bernadette Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.
__Howard Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?
__Bernadette We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.
__Bernadette Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.
__Leonard Hi.
__Joy Hi. You don't look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.
__Leonard Uh…
__Leonard Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?
__Joy Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy's nuts off.
__Leonard Wow. Wouldn't think there'd be that many.
__Joy Number 42!
__Leonard Whoa!
__Bernadette Isn't she a pip?
__Leonard Should be, it's thirty dollars a pound.
__Joy Hey, this is a date, right?
__Leonard Yep, it is.
__Joy 73!
__Leonard Whoa!
__Joy Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls' room and take a wicked whiz.
__Bernadette I'll go with you.
__Joy Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place.
__Howard I think she likes you.
__Amy Sheldon?
__Sheldon Rats!
__Amy I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.
__Sheldon No misunderstanding. I've learned what that request actually means, and I don't want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.
__Amy In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she'll be satisfied that I'm in a relationship.
__Sheldon So we'd be perpetrating a ruse?
__Amy Precisely.
__Sheldon And you haven't fallen hopelessly in love with me?
__Amy Don't be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
__Sheldon Amy Farrah Fowler, that's the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.
__Amy I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
__Sheldon Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
__Amy Sheldon, please, you're suffocating me.
__Sheldon My apologies. Good night, Amy.
__Amy Good night, Sheldon.
__Leonard Or maybe she'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn't tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.
__Howard Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn't even crack my top ten.
__Leonard I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.
__Howard Not that I've ever seen.
__Leonard It's relatively new. I just know that I'm not gonna spend time with someone I don't like simply to have a girlfriend. I'm okay on my own.
__Joy Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.
__Leonard Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…
__Joy Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin's wedding.
__Leonard You're asking me out?
__Joy Yeah. And it's an open bar, so I'll probably be giving it away.
__Leonard I look forward to it.
__Sheldon I assure you I am quite real and I'm having regular intercourse with your daughter.
__Mrs Fowler What?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. We're like wild animals in heat. It's a wonder neither of us has been hurt.
__Mrs Fowler Amy, what is he saying?
__Amy You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.
__Sheldon Oh, yes, it's time for me to make love to your daughter's vagina.
__Mrs Fowler Oh!
__Amy Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.
__Sheldon Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
__Leonard Problem?
__Howard This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
__Sheldon Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
__Raj Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
__Sheldon Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don't give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.
__Priya Oh, Sheldon. You haven't changed a bit, have you?
__Sheldon Why would I change?
__Leonard The hope has been that you'd eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?
__Priya I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.
__Raj Can you believe it? Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
__Sheldon Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it's actually extremely plausible.
__Leonard And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
__Priya I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.
__Leonard I'm going too, I'll show you where it is.
__Raj Alright, this goes without saying, but I'm just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
__Sheldon Why would I touch her, she's covered with airplane germs.
__Howard Hey, I've got a girlfriend now.
__Raj Oh please. My sister's much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
__Raj Dude, that's my sister you're talking about.
__Howard Okay, forget who's hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.
__Raj Did you pinky swear?
__Howard Yes.
__Raj Okay then.
__Sheldon Cobbler. I'm still laughing.
__Leonard Yeah. It's good to see you too. Here you go.
__Priya Thanks.
__Leonard Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Oh, not really, just hang out.
__Sheldon I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.
__Raj Train day?
__Sheldon The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that's right, the Hollywood Carney's, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.
__Raj I don't think we're going to do that.
__Sheldon Well then apparently, you hate fun.
__Sheldon He rejected train day.
__Leonard Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
__Sheldon Abundantly.
__Leonard I guess he just hates fun.
__Sheldon That's what I said.
__Priya Okay, so, what's new with you guys.
__Howard I have a girlfriend now.
__Priya Hey, good for you.
__Howard Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy?
__ So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you're here.
__Priya I don't know, I just have the one day.
__Sheldon Do you like trains?
__Priya Not particularly.
__Sheldon You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
__Leonard It's getting pretty late, how come you're still up?
__Sheldon I've found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
__Leonard That's pretty cool.
__Sheldon Oh yes. It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip, imagination.
__Priya Raj finally went to bed.
__Leonard Yeah, well,  Sheldon's still up.
__Priya You said he goes to bed at nine.
__Leonard Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
__Sheldon Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.
__Priya Can't you get rid of him?
__Leonard If the past is any indication, no.
__Sheldon Leonard, I'm trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.
__Sheldon Drop axe. Brilliant.
__Leonard Give me a minute. Sheldon,
__Sheldon Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.
__Leonard Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.
__Sheldon I know.
__Leonard Well then, bed mister.
__Sheldon Five more minutes.
__Leonard Really? You're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
__Sheldon Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
__Leonard You don't want that, do you?
__Sheldon No. But it's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
__Leonard Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.
__Sheldon That's unacceptable. We're supposed to be given written notice.
__Leonard No, no, it doesn't matter, we'll be at work.
__Sheldon Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there's no water for an enzyme soak.
__Leonard Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!
__Sheldon I'll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
__Leonard We're going to have to be very quiet.
__Sheldon I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let's see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I'm lost. Well, I'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.
__Leonard No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I'll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard You're right, you're lost, good luck.
__Leonard Huh! Sorry!
__Priya For what?
__Leonard I don't know. When I'm in bed with a girl, it's just, it's my go to response.
__Priya It's six o' clock, I have to get back to Raj's before he wakes up and realises I'm gone.
__Leonard Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.
__Priya Mmm. Me too.
__Leonard You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.
__Priya Where are you going with this, Leonard?
__Leonard Well, I'm just saying, I don't have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.
__Priya Leonard, didn't we have this conversation five years ago.
__Leonard Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you're older, I'm older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.
__Priya Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn't mean I want to have a serious relationship.
__Leonard It doesn't?
__Priya Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They'd have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.
__Leonard I'm not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that's not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
__Priya Aha, you're funny.
__Sheldon Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I heard a woman laughing.
__Leonard Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.
__Leonard Air freshener.
__Sheldon And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
__Leonard Uh, rash, that's a bad rash.
__Sheldon My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
__Leonard Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
__Sheldon Very well, I'm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.
__Leonard Okay, he's in the bathroom, let's go.
__Sheldon Do you prefer ointment or cream?
__Leonard Uh, cream.
__Sheldon With or without a numbing agent?
__Leonard Without.
__Sheldon Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.
__Leonard Fine. With.
__Sheldon Prescription or non-prescription strength.
__Leonard Use your best judgement.
__Sheldon Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.
__Leonard Sounds great.
__Sheldon Excellent choice.
__Leonard Right, right, alright.
__ Priya?
__Priya Good morning, Sheldon.
__Sheldon For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon What do you want to talk about?
__Leonard Please don't tell anyone I spent the night with Raj's sister.
__Sheldon There it is. What if someone asks?
__Leonard No-one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister.
__Sheldon Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
__Leonard Like what?
__Sheldon Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?
__Leonard Priya and I are both adults. We didn't betray Raj.
__Sheldon In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Sheldon April 12th, 2005, Bob's Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.
__Leonard Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.
__Sheldon And Raj.
__Leonard Alright, and Raj.
__Sheldon And me.
__Leonard You?
__Sheldon Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.
__Leonard Okay fine, I'm, I'm a horrible human being, I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
__Sheldon You're far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
__Leonard My point is, Priya's gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.
__Sheldon You mean, you want me to keep a secret.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon You know I can't keep a secret.
__Leonard You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you'd keep that secret. Right?
__Sheldon Why do you get to be Batman?
__Leonard Because, well, Batman has the secret.
__Sheldon Well Alfred has secrets too.
__Leonard Like what?
__Sheldon Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I've now just told to Batman. See, I can't keep a secret.
__Leonard What.
__Sheldon Ta-da. It's short for da-da-da-da!
__Leonard Kind of busy here, Sheldon.
__Sheldon I know, that's why I shortened it.
__Sheldon I came to go over your alibi for last night.
__Leonard What alibi?
__Leonard Oh, I'm so sure I'm going to regret this, but, who was I with?
__Leonard Oh, God.
__Sheldon You met her at Pasadena's most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin's, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.
__Leonard Leonard, call me if you're interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.
__Sheldon And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
__Mechanical voice on Sheldon's phone Mechanical voice on Sheldon' Top of the morning to you. You've reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.
__Sheldon It's pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn't even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.
__Leonard Where did you get that?
__Sheldon From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
__Leonard An orang-u-tan?
__Sheldon Well, no-one's going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.
__Leonard Sheldon, I don't need an alibi. Nobody's going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  Thankyou. Now don't worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard's whiteboard.
__Raj Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister's never been attracted to him.
__Leonard C'mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she's attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
__Sheldon And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya's preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.
__Raj Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?
__Leonard I didn't see it.
__Howard Didn't see it? What were you doing?
__Leonard Uh, I was out.
__Raj On Caprica night?
__Leonard Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.
__Howard Really, you, and where, where did you go?
__Leonard To, uh, Lucky Baldwin's.
__Sheldon Oh, I've heard of that place, isn't that Pasadena's favourite Irish watering hole.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?
__Leonard As a matter of fact I.. I… I can't… I can't… I can't do it.
__Sheldon Sure you can, you're doing fine, it's very believable.
__Leonard Look, I'm sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.
__Sheldon Don't listen to him, he's still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.
__Raj What were you doing with Priya?
__Raj What? You slept with my sister?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Howard How could you? We had a pact!
__Raj Excuse me, I think how could you she's my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
__Sheldon May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.
__Leonard Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.
__Raj I… I don't believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.
__Leonard No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.
__Raj How hard did she stomp?
__Leonard Very hard.
__Raj Okay, I'm good.
__Howard Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I'd never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.
__Leonard Really?
__Howard Mmm.
__Leonard Was it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
__Raj Dude! I put that thing on my face!
__Sheldon I think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
__Howard Hey, I didn't see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.
__Raj That was all a lie? This year's gifts are already wrapped!
__Sheldon Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.
__Leonard You put moths in my food?
__Sheldon For science.
__Raj I can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
__Sheldon You used my toothbrush?
__Raj Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.
__Leonard Okay, I, I, I think it's safe to say that we've all done some things we're not particularly proud of. But come on, we're friends. Friends overlook each other's minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I'm sorry that I broke our pact.
__Howard Thankyou, and I'm sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we're at it, you don't have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.
__Raj As long as we're apologising, Sheldon, I, I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.
__Sheldon And I'm sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.
__Raj I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
__Sheldon With real puffing smoke?
__Raj Yes.
__Sheldon Alright. But I'm watching you.
__Leonard These are pretty god, what flavour is this?
__Sheldon Guess.
__Leonard Papaya?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Guava?
__Sheldon You're so close.
__Leonard I give up.
__Sheldon Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!
__Sheldon The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
__Leonard What does that have to do with me and women?
__Sheldon Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
__Leonard My problem is, I don't project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I'm going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.
__Raj Oh, yeah? What's that look like?
__Leonard Hi. I'm Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I'm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.
__Raj Where are we going?
__Howard Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
__Sheldon Excuse me. If we're changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.
__Leonard Congratulations Howard.
__Howard Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.
__Raj Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don't want to speak to the FBI.
__Leonard Why not?
__Raj I'm brown and I talk funny.
__Howard They're just doing a background check on me.
__Raj It doesn't matter. They'll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it's not offensive.
__Leonard Don't be ridiculous, Raj. You're here legally.
__Raj Nobody cares. Do you know how long it's been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
__Sheldon You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.
__Leonard Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.
__Sheldon No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.
__ Credits sequence.
__Woman at Door Dr. Koothrappali?  I'm Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in?  I'd like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz.  Oh, thank you. All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?
__Raj Rum cake?
__Page No, thanks. Now, about Mr. Wolowitz.
__Raj Seven years.
__Page I see.
__Raj I'm in this country legally, you know.
__Page I'm sure you are. Now, to your knowledge, has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?
__Raj Of course not. I'm here on an H-1B visa, which means I can't be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I'm not.
__Page Good. To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts?
__Raj No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.
__Page Excuse me?
__Raj Please don't send me back to India, it's so crowded. It's like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody's wearing the same costume, Indian Guy.
__Page Dr. Koothrappali, I'm not…
__Raj I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I'm a real Yankee Doodle boy!
__Page Dr. Koothrappali, please.
__Raj My country 'tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It's really great.
__Page Who?
__Leonard Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?
__Page You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?
__Leonard Yes. Of course, we're in different departments. He's an engineer and I'm an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.
__Page Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?
__Leonard Good. It's a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.
__Page Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?
__Leonard You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I'm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.
__Page Sounds great.
__Leonard Really?
__Page Yeah. Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL husband come with us?
__Leonard Is that, oh, my, I didn't see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I'm starting to exude.
__Sheldon Not particularly.
__Leonard Could you get that?
__Sheldon I suppose I could if I were asked.
__Leonard Would you please get that?
__Sheldon Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?
__Page Dr. Cooper?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Page I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.
__Sheldon You say you're Special Agent Page, FBI.
__Page Here's my I.D.
__Sheldon And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn't prove I know Batman.
__Page I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.
__Sheldon Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.
__Page Thank you.
__Sheldon For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?
__Page Fidelity, bravery, integrity?
__Sheldon Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven't I heard back yet?
__Page Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.
__Sheldon That's of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
__Page Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?
__Sheldon A little, but go on.
__Page Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?
__Sheldon I'm going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn't notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?
__Page That's really not the sort of thing we're interested in.
__Sheldon You heard me say blu-ray, right?
__Page I did.
__Sheldon Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?
__Page I'm afraid not. Is there anything else?
__Sheldon Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he's overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that's not irresponsible, I don't know what is.
__Page The Mars Rover?
__Sheldon Did I say Mars Rover?
__Page You did.
__Sheldon That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.
__Page Yes, well, let's talk about it anyway.
__Sheldon I don't want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz's culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
__Page Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need.
__Sheldon Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.
__Leonard What happened?
__Howard Apparently, the background interviews didn't go well. You guys wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
__Raj Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.
__Leonard And I may have hit on her a little bit.
__Howard I see. Well, it's good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.
__Leonard I feel awful.
__Raj Ah, me, too.
__Leonard To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it'd be Sheldon.
__Sheldon Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.
__Sheldon Sleep eludes me, Leonard.
__Leonard Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
__Sheldon Mockery? That's all you have to offer?
__Leonard I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?
__Leonard Did something happen today that's bothering you?
__Sheldon Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon But why should that keep me up?
__Leonard Because you feel guilty?
__Sheldon Interesting. So you're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
__Leonard Actually, you don't have insomnia. You're sleeping now.
__Sheldon Excuse me?
__Leonard You're having a guilt-ridden dream.
__Sheldon Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
__Leonard How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
__Sheldon That seems fairly conclusive.  No, Gorn, no. That's where I sit.
__Page Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Page Was your statement untrue?
__Sheldon No.
__Page Then I'm afraid you can't withdraw it.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I don't recall you saying no backsies.
__Page Is there anything else?
__Sheldon Yes. I'd like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard's many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O's for outstanding, which he is such. W's for witty, he's quick with a joke. A's for artistic, his ability…
__Page I'm sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.
__Sheldon But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.
__Page It's closed.
__Sheldon I don't understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.
__Page This is Leonard Hofstadter?
__Sheldon No, it's a different Leonard. He's Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.
__Raj I think he's eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.
__Sheldon I'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He's responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.
__Dr Tyson But I actually didn't demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.
__Sheldon If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.
__Dr Tyson Is that the guy you were telling me about?
__Raj Oh, yeah.
__Howard You?
__Sheldon Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.
__Howard And they were okay with that?
__Sheldon No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I'm here now to say I'm sorry.
__Howard Are you kidding me? You've set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I'm sorry?
__Sheldon Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.
__Howard Your apology is not accepted.
__Sheldon You're tricking me. It really is, isn't it?
__Howard Leave me alone, Sheldon.
__Dr Tyson Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I'm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.
__Sheldon Oh, shut up.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny What are you doing here?
__Sheldon I have troubles, Penny. I've come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.
__Penny You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.
__Sheldon I don't like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.
__Penny Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?
__Penny Could you be a little more specific?
__Sheldon Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
__Penny I'm sorry, honey, I don't know millilitres.
__Sheldon Ah. Blame President James “Jimmy” Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.
__Penny Would you say that's about 40 milliliters?
__Sheldon More or less.
__Penny Great.  Now, where were we?
__Sheldon I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there's an app for that. Let's see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.
__Penny A what?
__Sheldon You'll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…
__Sheldon That's not how it looks in the picture.
__Penny Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don't you give it a try.
__Sheldon All right. To the metric system.  I can't taste the cherries.
__Penny All right. Sheldon, what's on your mind?
__Penny Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.
__Sheldon Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?
__Penny I drink.
__Sheldon To drinking.  Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.
__Penny You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there's nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.
__Sheldon I see. You're saying I'm facing Starfleet Academy's unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.
__Penny Exactly. Sometimes you can't win.
__Sheldon Captain Kirk won.
__Sheldon Impressive that you know that. It's hard to believe I'm actually having this conversation with you.
__Penny Right there with you.
__Sheldon Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That's it.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon I'll reprogram Howard.
__Penny What? Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.
__Sheldon No, you can't reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk.
__Raj Hello.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Howard, you're feeling better about me today, aren't you?
__Howard Not really.
__Sheldon Yes, you are. I'm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.
__Howard Oh. Go away, Sheldon.
__Sheldon There's a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
__Raj What's in the bag?
__Sheldon It's for Howard.
__Howard Oh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.
__Sheldon Nevertheless, I've hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.
__Howard You're giving me a couch cushion?
__Sheldon No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I'm giving you my spot on the couch.
__Howard But you love that spot.
__Sheldon No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it's yours.
__Raj Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.
__Howard All right. Apology accepted.
__Sheldon High five. Not too hard. Thank you.
__Raj I haven't cried like this since Toy Story 3.
__Sheldon I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.
__Penny How long?
__Leonard 94 seconds.
__Howard Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That's how I learned.
__Leonard I can't believe you've never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.
__Penny And I can't believe you've never read Eat, Pray, Love.
__Leonard When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I'll read it.
__Howard I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I'm not reading it.
__Penny You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.
__Sheldon That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson's Thriller video, which I've never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it's really scary.
__Leonard Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
__Sheldon There's no switch. Just listen and learn.
__Howard Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.
__Penny Well, I'm watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?
__Sheldon Because the print they're showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
__Penny What, 21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!
__Leonard Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
__Sheldon Did Leonard? I'm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh, good. I'm eight for 26 this month.
__Penny Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.
__Leonard Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.
__Penny Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.
__Howard Uh-huh. I'm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Relax, it's five o'clock. The movie doesn't start till midnight.
__Sheldon Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it's already five o'clock. Let's go.
__Howard You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.
__Howard Actually, I'm not. I'm using sarcasm to mock you.
__Sheldon Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.
__Leonard Don't worry, Sheldon. We'll be fine.
__Sheldon What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 Nemesis?
__Leonard Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn' Nemesis.
__Sheldon But how were our seats?
__Leonard Excellent.
__Sheldon I rest my case. Amy, don't you agree we should leave now and get in line?
__Amy Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.
__Sheldon Shrewd.
__Amy Leonard, you're right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all.
__Leonard Thank you, Amy.
__Amy See? It's working.
__Bernadette Knock-knock.
__Howard Who's there?
__Bernadette Olive.
__Howard Olive you, too.
__Leonard Guys, that's really starting to get old.
__Howard Knock-knock.
__Leonard Who's there?
__Howard I have a girlfriend and you don't.
__Leonard Hysterical!
__Sheldon Wait, now, we don't know that yet. He isn't finished. I have a girlfriend and you don't who?
__Howard So. Are you sure you don't want to come with us to Raiders?
__Bernadette Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls' night tonight.
__Amy Girls' night? What does that entail?
__Bernadette Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk.
__Amy I'm a girl.
__Bernadette Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I'll ask Penny.
__Amy No need. Penny and I are very close.
__Bernadette You are?
__Amy Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you're planning a girls' night.
__Penny Yeah?
__Amy I'm a girl.
__Penny Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.
__Amy Yes, but they're not girls. I'm a girl.
__Penny Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.
__Amy What's the dress code?
__Penny Uh, just wear something comfortable.
__Amy All right. I'll have to go shopping.
__Sheldon Knock-knock.
__Leonard Who‘s there?
__Sheldon Hugh.
__Leonard Hugh who?
__Sheldon Hugh people need to listen to me. It's time to get in line for the movie. And that's how you tell a knock-knock joke.
__Howard Ooh. Can't wait for that to start.
__Sheldon I informed you thusly.
__Raj Eight for 28.
__Sheldon This is where we could have been if we hadn't stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.
__Raj Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.
__Leonard So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner.
__Raj You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us–
__Howard Oh, shut up.
__Penny You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn't just have to be about our lady parts.
__Bernadette Penny, your nails look great.
__Penny Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It's in a woman's basement. I think it's a front
__ for human trafficking, but they do a really good job.
__ A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don't tell me that's not girl talk.
__Penny So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?
__Bernadette Or we could just stay here.
__Amy Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don't.
__Penny All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.
__Bernadette Gee, I don't know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I've got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is.
__Penny That's okay. Y ou can just sleep here.
__Amy Oh, good, a slumber party! We'll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!
__Penny Oh, gosh, Amy. I don't know if I would call this an actual slumber party.
__Amy Well, that's disappointing. I've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.
__Bernadette Oh, you never were?
__Penny Not even when you were a kid?
__Amy Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn't make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun.
__Penny Okay. Well, I guess we're having a slumber party. Oh!
__Howard Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.
__Leonard What's a stadium pal?
__Howard Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm.
__Sheldon What did he say?
__Leonard Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.
__Sheldon We might not get seats?
__Leonard It's fine, it's fine. Go back to sleep.
__Sheldon Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.
__Leonard Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You're peeing, aren't you?
__Wil Wheaton Hey, look who's here! Hey, buddies!
__Sheldon Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.
__Wil Mee-sa think that very funny.
__Sheldon Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
__Theatre Staff Wil Wheaton.
__Wil Yeah.
__Theatre Staff I'm a big fan.
__Sheldon Of what? Poorly executed beards?
__Wil Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie? We got here a little late.
__Theatre Staff No problem. Come on, I'll hook you up.
__Wil Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.
__Sheldon This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.
__Leonard Calm down, Sheldon.
__Sheldon I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!
__Leonard Had to wake him up from his nap, didn't you?
__Penny Howard has a hairy chest?
__Bernadette No, just the one. But it's really long.
__Penny Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?
__Amy My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.
__Sheldon Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.
__Leonard Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it's only going to upset you.
__Amy I'm not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia's list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.
__Penny Okay, it's your game. You go first.
__Amy Hang on. I'm familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?
__Bernadette Truth.
__Amy All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?
__Bernadette Um.
__Amy Remember, you have to answer honestly.
__Penny Wait. No, Amy, you're supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing.
__Amy Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?
__Theatre staff Guys, I am sorry. We are full up.
__Sheldon No!
__Theatre staff We're full up.
__Leonard We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?
__Theatre staff Sorry. Fire regulations. Should've gotten here earlier.
__Sheldon This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don't.
__Howard I guess that's that. Let's go home.
__Sheldon You know what? I'm going back to I told you so. I told you so.
__Raj We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.
__Sheldon Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round.
__Howard I guess we'd better go after him.
__Leonard Short Round?
__Raj Indy's young sidekick from Temple of Doom.
__Leonard Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?
__Raj You're right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.
__Penny What the hell was that?
__Amy Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller's Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.
__Bernadette I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.
__Amy You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.
__Bernadette Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?
__Penny Truth.
__Bernadette Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
__Amy Oh, that's an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other's company.
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Penny Dare.
__Amy I don't believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Penny Okay, look, just because we're not seeing each other anymore doesn't mean we can't be friends. I mean, Leonard's a great guy.
__Amy Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?
__Penny I don't know. He got really serious, and I wasn't ready for it.
__Amy Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?
__Penny You can only ask one question.
__Amy and Bernadette together That one.
__Penny You know what, I don't want to play anymore.
__Amy Well, I'm not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won.
__Howard Where did he go?  We're looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.
__Sheldon You whistled?
__Leonard What is that?
__Sheldon Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can't see it, no one else can see it.
__Leonard Sheldon, this is crazy.
__Sheldon No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
__Leonard Listen to me. You are over-tired. You're not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
__Sheldon Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it's Lee, but I prefer Trouble.
__Wil Wheaton Oh, look who they let in.
__Sheldon Don't worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!
__Howard Come on, Short Round.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Raj Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!
__Howard Let's see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.
__Wil He's got the movie! Get him!
__Sheldon Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
__Amy Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity.
__Bernadette Ooh, like what?
__Amy Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.
__Bernadette Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?
__Amy Penny?
__Penny Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I'm sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?
__Amy Don't worry. I'll avoid the nether yea.
__Bernadette I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
__Howard You want to talk brave, how about Captain America's undocumented Mexican gardener?
__Leonard He's not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
__Sheldon As usual, you're all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.
__Howard How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?
__Sheldon Now you just being silly. Wolverine's never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  Hello. Yes, the elevator's out of order you'll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.
__Leonard I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
__Raj Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
__Howard That's a stupid question.
__Raj We're having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
__Leonard Oh, um, is Penny here?
__Man You're Leonard, right?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Man Damn, it's good to finally meet you, son.
__Leonard Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.
__Penny Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.
__Leonard Oh, good. Context.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Come on in, buddy. Take a load off.
__Penny Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can't stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I'll see you later.  Bye.
__Leonard That was odd.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Is that racist? It feels racist.
__Howard Don't be oversensitive. He's calling you illiterate, not your race.
__Raj Oh, okay. Good. I don't need more comics. Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.
__Sheldon I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.
__Howard Actually, Indian Monopoly's just like regular, except the money's in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.
__Leonard You'll never guess what just happened.
__Sheldon You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Aw.
__Leonard Penny kissed me.
__Sheldon Well, who would ever guess that?
__Raj What… what kind of a kiss?
__Howard Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.
__Leonard She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.
__Howard Maybe she was trying to send you a message.
__Leonard You think?
__Leonard Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
__Sheldon Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
__Leonard I'm just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.
__Howard Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it's nice to hear the hits.
__Raj Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.
__Leonard Why do I bother talking to you people?
__Sheldon If it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.
__Penny Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Sheldon I'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza.
__Penny So you're probably wondering what that was all about.
__Leonard What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.
__Penny Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.
__Leonard What? Why?
__Penny Well, you're the first guy he's ever really approved of, you know? You're a scientist who went to college and you don't have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.
__Leonard What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
__Penny Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how's Leonard? why can't you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.
__Leonard Really? How, how'd we manage that?
__Penny What?
__Leonard Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?
__Penny Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.
__Leonard Yeah, no, I don't think so.
__Penny Okay, why are you arguing about this?
__Leonard I'm just saying, if we fake got back together, that's totally not how it fake happened.
__Penny Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?
__Leonard Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I'm good with that.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Penny, you out here?
__Penny Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Relax, I've seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.
__Leonard See? He doesn't mind.
__Penny's Dad Penny' So, Leonard, I'm taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?
__Penny Oh, dad, that's nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?
__Leonard Uh, I do, I have to work. But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, 'cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard Come here, you.
__Raj Miss.
__Howard How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.
__Raj Not if it has a hole in the middle.
__Howard What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
__Raj A Romulan battle bagel?
__Bernadette Knock-knock.
__Howard Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.
__Bernadette So where's the telescope?
__Howard It's in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He's hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.
__Bernadette So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?
__Howard I did it with you when we rented The Notebook.  Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You'd better open up that bottle of wine or I'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear.
__Raj Excuse me. I can't be drinking, I'm about to make an important scientific discovery here.
__Howard What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
__Raj How do you know that?
__Howard Well, he was Italian. It's a reasonable assumption.
__Raj Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?
__Howard Oh, I, I'm sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you're my best friend, she's my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.
__Raj Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
__Howard Yes, but she's stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.
__Raj I do appreciate that.
__Bernadette Here we go.
__Howard Well I'd like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.
__Bernadette Hold on. Wait. No, it's okay, go ahead.
__Howard What?
__Bernadette Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.
__Penny's dad Penny' My pleasure. It's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny's that knows how to use a napkin.
__Penny So not funny, dad.
__Wyatt Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.
__Penny Oh, will you please let it go?
__Wyatt Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.
__Leonard A lot of people are doing that.
__Penny Oh, see?
__Wyatt Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom's Camry.
__Penny Yeah, that's great. It's a funny story. Moving on.
__Wyatt And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?
__Penny Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.
__Wyatt I don't know. That petition looked real to me.
__Penny Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.
__Wyatt Well, I'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.
__Leonard Thanks, Wyatt. I'm a keeper.
__Leonard Maybe I could go in a little late.
__Penny No, no, no, you can't. Your career is far too important.
__Wyatt Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won't let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?
__Leonard Don't I know it.
__Wyatt Well, good night, son.
__Leonard Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.
__Penny Good night.
__Leonard I love you.
__Sheldon Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.
__Raj Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.
__Bernadette It won't help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.
__Raj Yeah. Like his haircut material.
__Bernadette Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?
__Raj No. I got them all cut.
__Bernadette Which is still so funny.
__Raj And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.
__Bernadette Right. Help, I'm a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.
__Howard Okay, I think that's enough about me.
__Raj He's right. Let's make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!
__Bernadette Howard, help me out of the tub! I'm stuck again!
__Penny Shut up. You know what I've been doing for the last hour?
__Leonard Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?
__Penny Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
__Leonard You got to admit, I am, I'm delightful.
__Penny Why are you making this so difficult?
__Leonard It's not difficult for me. I'm having fun.
__Penny Leonard.
__Leonard What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we're broken up?
__Penny No.
__ –
__Penny I don't know.
__Leonard Don't you think that's something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
__Penny Maybe.
__Sheldon Leonard, Penny, excellent. I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny's annoying personal habits.
__Penny Oh, my God. What personal habits?
__Leonard I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.
__Penny Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this because Leonard and I are not…
__Leonard Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
__Sheldon Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I'll have no truck with plots.
__Penny No, you're right. No, there's, there's no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?
__Sheldon Uh, we don't discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.
__Leonard Fines?
__Sheldon Yes. If Penny's going to be spending nights here again, you'll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.
__Howard It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
__Bernadette Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you're looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?
__Raj Maybe. If it did, I'd be famous. I'd be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.
__Bernadette That sounds great.
__Raj It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.
__Howard We'd come visit you.
__Raj No, you wouldn't. You'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.
__Bernadette He's taking a turn to the dark side, isn't he?
__Howard Hold on. He could come back.
__Raj Oh, what's the point of everything?
__Raj You know it's been more than a year since I've even kissed a girl?
__Howard What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?
__Raj Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.
__Bernadette Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you're a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who'll want to kiss you.
__Raj Where?
__Bernadette You just have to look.
__Howard No!
__Bernadette Well, this was fun.
__Leonard Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.
__Leonard Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
__Wyatt Oh, that's me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn't want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we're fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch.
__Leonard Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.
__Wyatt That's Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing's bull squirt, huh? Well, that's very disappointing. Bye.
__Leonard Oh, hey. There's been something I've been meaning to tell you.
__Leonard Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.
__Leonard No hurry.
__Wyatt That my own daughter thinks I don't love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply.
__Penny I'm sorry, daddy…
__Wyatt Let me finish.
__Penny Oh.
__Wyatt I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?
__Penny You know, I'm sorry.
__Wyatt You're a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.
__Penny You're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.
__Wyatt Thank you. Now, why don't you go and put some clothes on and we'll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you.
__Penny Daddy, he had nothing to do…
__Wyatt Keep walking.
__Penny Okay.
__Wyatt Please, please, please don't give up on her.
__Leonard What?
__Wyatt I can't go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.
__Leonard Gee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.
__Wyatt Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don't care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.
__Wyatt Thank you. Now I'm going to do something here to help you along.
__Leonard Excuse me?
__Wyatt Just don't panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!
__Leonard Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That's very clever.
__Wyatt Don't yap. Just get out.
__Leonard I'll friend you on Facebook.
__Leonard Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.
__Sheldon Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?
__Leonard Oh, how'd it go last night?
__Raj Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.
__Leonard Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
__Raj Why? You writing a book?
__Sheldon I'm going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.
__Raj Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
__Sheldon That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
__Howard Hey.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Howard Hey.
__Raj Hey.
__Leonard You get to play with Raj's big telescope last night?
__Howard Whoa. Where did that come from?
__Raj He never touched my telescope.
__Howard Way to go shutting up.
__Raj I did shut up. Now you shut up.
__Howard Fine.
__Raj Thank you. How come you didn't call me this morning?
__Leonard It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.
__Sheldon Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.
__Sheldon What is the best number? By the way, there's only one correct answer.
__Raj Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?
__Sheldon Wrong. The best number is 73. You're probably wondering why.
__Leonard No.
__Howard Uh-uh.
__Raj We're good.
__Sheldon 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?
__Leonard We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
__Sheldon Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.
__Raj Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.
__Leonard Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn't want to eat with us tonight?
__Howard Yeah, I get it now.
__Bernadette Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It's the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.
__Amy Did you know that the iconic Valentine's heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?
__Penny Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I's with little asses? Cool.
__Zack Hey, Penny, how's it going?
__Penny Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?
__Zack My dad's company prints the menus for this place. I'm just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes 'em easier to clean if people throw up on 'em. Guess how I got the idea?
__Penny Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.
__Bernadette Hi.
__Zack Hey.
__Amy Hoo.
__Zack Okay, well, it was good to see you.
__Penny Yeah, you, too.
__Bernadette He's really cute. How do you know him?
__Penny Oh, we went out a couple of times.
__Amy I'm often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?
__Bernadette Yes.
__Penny No, no. But in this case, yes.
__Amy Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
__Penny No, it was great. He just didn't really challenge me on an intellectual level.
__Bernadette Couldn't you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
__Penny Wouldn't help. Zack can't even spell NPR.
__Bernadette It's what I do with Howard. I'm much smarter than he is. But it's important to protect his manhood.
__Amy Hoo.
__Bernadette What's the matter?
__Amy I'm suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.
__Penny Oh, we know what's causing that, don't we?
__Amy It's no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard No. What happened?
__Howard They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
__Raj Did he get superpowers?
__Howard No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.
__Raj Oh. Well, that's disappointing.
__Howard Why?
__Raj Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.
__Howard Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?
__Raj Who wouldn't? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.
__Howard Mouse Boy?
__Raj You don't like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?
__Howard First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn't be the sidekick. You'd be the sidekick.
__Raj Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.
__Howard Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who's the obvious sidekick?
__Raj Yeah, Leonard, who?
__Leonard 12 years after high school, and I'm still at the nerd table.
__Amy It's too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it's fine.
__Sheldon Well, you're the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.
__Amy Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Amy Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.
__Sheldon Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.
__Amy No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I'm checking my vital signs every hour.
__Sheldon I'd be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
__Amy Oh, that sounds like fun.
__Sheldon All right. What were the symptoms?
__Sheldon Localized to what region?
__Amy Ears and genitalia.
__Sheldon Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
__Amy I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny's friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.
__Sheldon Who?
__Amy Zack.
__Sheldon Then why did you ask?
__Amy Ask what?
__Sheldon Who.
__Amy Zack.
__Sheldon All right, let's start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?
__Amy Hoo.
__Sheldon Zack.
__Amy Why do you keep saying Zack?
__Sheldon Because you keep saying who.
__Amy I'm not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.
__Sheldon And the answer was Zack, correct?
__Amy There was no question. I simply said hoo.
__Sheldon All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.
__Amy Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
__Raj Oh, hey.
__Howard Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?
__Raj I don't know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you're going to die, and then you do.
__Howard No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.
__Raj Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…
__Howard Spiders! You're afraid of spiders!
__Raj What the heck is this?
__Howard A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.
__Raj Are you crazy?
__Howard Perhaps. Are you scared?
__Raj No. But it's a stupid test.
__Howard Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?
__Raj Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?
__Howard Oh, come on. That's never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.
__Howard How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
__Raj It's easy. The spider's crawling up your arm.
__Howard Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!
__Sheldon How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
__Amy Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.
__Sheldon Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
__Amy I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny's friend Zack.
__Sheldon Hang on. I don't know that we've given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
__Amy Let's look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.
__Sheldon A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.
__Amy Religion?
__Sheldon The Motion Picture?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Don't. It's terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.
__Sheldon Cheap science fiction?
__Amy What are you doing?
__Sheldon Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
__Amy Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
__Sheldon I hadn't considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I've considered it.
__Amy And?
__Sheldon I reject it.
__Amy You reject it because you don't feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?
__Sheldon I think I'll eat my lunch at home.
__Amy That's not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.
__Penny Hey. Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?
__Sheldon The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I'll need time to make things right.
__Penny That's thinking ahead.
__Sheldon The alternative would be to think backwards. And that's just remembering.
__Penny So how's Amy?
__Sheldon Amy's changed. I might have to let her go.
__Penny Oh, no. Why?
__Sheldon I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.
__Penny Just going to skip over that insult.
__Sheldon What insult?
__Penny Yeah. That's why I'm going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what's the
__ scientific word?
__ Forget science. She's horny.
__Penny Oh! Okay. Wow.
__Sheldon It's simple biology. There's nothing I can do about it.
__Penny Are you sure?
__Sheldon What are you suggesting?
__Sheldon It's illegal to spay a human being.
__Penny Yeah. That's not what I had in mind.
__Sheldon Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
__Penny Exactly.
__Sheldon Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I'll let you know what happens.
__Penny Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.
__Howard You got a better idea?
__Leonard Every idea is better than this idea.
__Howard Ding!
__Raj Wait. What the hell is ding?
__Howard It's a bell.
__Raj I don't think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
__Howard Fine. How do you want to start?
__Raj I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?
__Howard One-two-three-go? That's for babies.
__Raj Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?
__Howard That's for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.
__Raj No, it's chilly outside. Didn't bring my jacket.
__Howard Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?
__Raj What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.
__Howard All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.
__Raj Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you're going to say when we do start, or…
__Howard We're starting now!
__Raj Don't yell at me!
__Leonard Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
__Amy I'm sure it'll wash off.
__Sheldon Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell's Angel.
__Amy There's Zack.
__Sheldon Are you sure this is what you want to do?
__Amy It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.
__Sheldon Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.
__Amy Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.
__Sheldon Please don't drag this out. This is never going to come off.
__Amy Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare's metaphorical beast with two backs.
__Zack My gluteus what?
__Amy On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.
__Zack Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.
__Raj Oh, yeah? Well, I've been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.
__Howard Oh, yeah? Won't matter, you're going down!
__Raj No, uh-uh, you're going down!
__Howard If anybody's going to go down, it's going to be you.
__Leonard Fellas. It's been 30 minutes. Nobody's touched each other.
__Amy As am I. (Holds Sheldon's hand)
__Sheldon What are you doing?
__Amy An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.
__Howard I prefer to think that I can't lose.
__Raj You're wrong. It's only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man's rat trap.
__Howard You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?
__Raj Just because I didn't express myself well doesn't mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
__Howard You narcissistic nincompoop!
__Raj You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you're missing some very excellent superhero quips.
__Howard Ice Dragon.
__Leonard Lesser Warlord of Ka'a.
__Sheldon Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
__Leonard Infinite Sheldon?
__Sheldon Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.
__Leonard Do you understand why people don't want to play with you?
__Sheldon No, although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool.
__Leonard Hey.
__Zack Hey.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.
__Leonard Oh, thanks.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Zack Check it out, all about planets this month.
__Leonard That's an atom.
__Zack Agree to disagree. That's what I love about science, there's no one right answer.
__Leonard So, you and Zack again, huh?
__Penny Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.
__Zack Were we here earlier?
__Zack Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.
__Howard Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?
__Zack You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it'll just come back to life.
__Sheldon Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
__Zack No, I'm almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.
__Leonard They might be smarter than some people.
__Zack Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.
__Sheldon Oh, that's easy enough. We'd need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.
__Zack I don't get it.
__Leonard A dolphin might.
__Sheldon That's not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
__Zack Let's go.
__Penny You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you.
__Penny You laughed.
__Howard No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.
__Raj And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
__Leonard That happened to you?
__Raj First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
__Leonard I don't know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.
__Howard So go apologize.
__Leonard Why me?
__Howard You started it, we just piled on.
__Leonard What would I even say?
__Sheldon Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid. Have a Milk Dud.
__Raj A Milk Dud?
__Sheldon Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
__Leonard I got a better idea. We're all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who's with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?
__Raj Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
__Sheldon You're embarrassing yourself.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.
__Zack What do you want?
__Leonard Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.
__Zack No, you weren't. You were making fun of me.
__Leonard Come on, that's what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.
__Sheldon That's very hurtful.
__Leonard See?
__Zack I don't know, it still wasn't very nice.
__Zack Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we're cool.
__Sheldon Junior Mints.
__Zack You guys want to come in and have a beer?
__Leonard Uh, we're on our way to the comic book store.
__Howard Leonard's buying.
__Zack Really? I haven't been to a comic book store in literally a million years.
__Sheldon Literally? Literally a million years?
__Leonard Don't.
__Zack You want to go with 'em?
__Penny No.
__Zack Okay, see you later.
__Penny Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you're ditching me to go look at comic books?
__Zack Are you mad at me?
__Penny I'm not happy.
__Zack Milk Dud?
__Sheldon In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.
__Zack Oh, no, you're thinking old-school Archie. It's much more sophisticated now. Like, there's two universes, and Archie's married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.
__Raj No.
__Zack About time, right?
__Stuart Hey.
__Zack Hey.
__Stuart You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?
__Zack Wow, lucky you.
__Stuart Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.
__Zack Sweet.
__Stuart Is that sarcasm?
__Howard Uh, no, it's an indictment of the American education system.
__Raj The Archies are over here.
__Zack Yippee.
__Sheldon Of course. We're coming as the Justice League of America.
__Howard Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
__Sheldon To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.
__Leonard Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
__Sheldon That's sad. Let's ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?
__Stuart Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard's mother in high-heeled boots?
__Sheldon I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
__Leonard Zack?
__Howard He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
__Leonard You can't replace me with Zack.
__Sheldon Why not? Penny did it.
__Howard Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn't we be?
__Zack Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.
__Sheldon Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?
__Zack I don't know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.
__Raj But I'm Green Lantern.
__Leonard You can be Aquaman.
__Raj I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.
__Zack Hey, babe.
__Penny I'm still mad at you.
__Zack Well, you won't be when you hear the great news.
__Penny What great news?
__Zack We're going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year's Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.
__Sheldon Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
__Penny Wait, why me? Wh-Why can't your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
__Howard She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
__Penny Okay, what about your friend Amy?
__Sheldon Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't believe in wearing costumes. She isn't the free spirit I am.
__Penny Okay, well, forget it. I'm not spending my New Year's Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.
__Howard He says he'll wear it if you'll be Aquaman.
__Sheldon We're going to be late. I'm pacing nervously.
__Leonard You're jogging.
__Sheldon This is how the Flash paces.
__ Leonard; Just chill out, Sheldon.
__ I'm not Sheldon. I'm the Flash. And now I'm going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I'm back.
__Howard I'm Batman.
__Sheldon Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he's running late.
__Howard I had to walk. I couldn't get Raj on the back of my scooter.
__Raj I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
__Zack Look up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. I forget the rest.
__Penny All right. Let's get this thing over with.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
__Howard Relax. No one's going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.
__Zack Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?
__Penny No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.
__Zack Come on. We're trying to win a contest here.
__Penny Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig.
__Zack Penny, there's no I in Justice League.
__Howard Well, actually.
__Sheldon Don't. He's making our case.
__Zack Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.
__Penny Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I'm not going.
__Raj Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
__Penny I'm not talking to you.
__Zack Then who are you talking to? Babe?
__Sheldon Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny.
__Penny What the hell is wrong with you?
__Sheldon I'm the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.
__Penny Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?
__Sheldon I understand why you're upset.
__Penny Really?
__Sheldon Yes. You're afraid that costume makes you look fat.
__Penny No. Wait, wait, does it?
__Sheldon Don't worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
__Penny Good-bye, Sheldon.
__Sheldon But they're not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?
__Leonard If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.
__Zack Whoa. You dated Penny?
__Leonard She didn't tell you?
__Zack She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?
__Leonard Who else would it be?
__Zack I don't know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?
__Sheldon I may have failed.
__Howard Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.
__Zack I don't want to go without Penny.
__Raj Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.
__Sheldon Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.
__Raj Ooh, I call Kermit.
__Sheldon I'm Kermit. You're Scooter.
__Raj Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
__Howard No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.
__Leonard What makes you think I can convince her?
__Howard You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.
__Leonard Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?
__Sheldon Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
__Leonard It's Leonard.
__Penny Oh. Go away, Leonard.
__ Leonard; Come on, let me just talk to you.
__ It's open.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny I'm not going to that party, Leonard.
__Leonard Okay, listen. You don't have to wear the wig. At this party, we're gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.
__Penny It's not the wig.
__Leonard Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.
__Penny Okay, look. We're not really me and him.
__Leonard Then what are you?
__Penny I don't know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn't be alone on New Year's Eve. How pathetic is that?
__Leonard Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year's Eve.
__Penny You make a cute Green Arrow.
__Leonard Green Lantern.
__Penny Like there's a difference.
__Leonard There's a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
__Penny Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.
__Leonard What about me?
__Penny Nothing. Let's go to the party.  How do I look?
__Leonard Um, I guarantee you'll be the prettiest girl there.
__Howard Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.
__Sheldon Oh.
__Zack Yes.
__Sheldon What's the bad news?
__Howard Superman probably isn't getting laid tonight.
__Zack Aw, damn.
__Sheldon Thank you! Thank you so much!
__Stuart Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.
__All Ten, nine, eight…
__Sheldon No, wait! I have a speech.
__Sheldon Stop counting!
__All Five, four, three…
__All Two, one! Happy New Year!
__Sheldon I'm not going to say another word until you people settle down. I'm waiting.
__Penny Are you high?
__Leonard You're being a bully.
__Howard Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.
__Leonard What should we do?
__Sheldon We're the Justice League of America. There's only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.
__Zack Zack (after a moment's thought): Nah. Hold up.
__Sheldon Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter!  Fine.
__Raj That's a Hanukkah present you're regretting, huh?
__Sheldon I won't say that all senior citizens who can't master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.
__Leonard I had a great idea. You know how we're always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you're doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?
__Sheldon Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.
__Leonard I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!
__Raj You know what's a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
__Sheldon You know, Leonard, that's actually a valid idea. Very good.
__Leonard Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
__Sheldon No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat. I'll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.
__Leonard Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can't promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.
__Howard A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother's house.
__Raj Where would you go?
__Howard I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
__Raj You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.
__Howard What's that? Some weird sex thing?
__Raj No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?
__Leonard I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we'll have ourselves an app to sell.
__Howard Sounds like we're in business.
__Raj I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Oh!
__Raj Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord, shush.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you're just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?
__Penny Who, me?
__Howard Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…
__Sheldon The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
__Leonard She's not going to steal our idea.
__Penny What idea?
__Leonard We're gonna write an application…
__Sheldon The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…
__Penny Okay, stop, stop!
__Sheldon Of Texas.
__Penny Whatever your secret is, I'm sure it's boring, so I'm not interested.
__Leonard It's not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…
__Penny Bored.
__Leonard Satisfied?
__Sheldon Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
__Penny Hey, wait a minute.
__Howard Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.
__Sheldon Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.
__Howard Hey, I…
__Sheldon She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.
__Leonard That is ridiculous.
__Sheldon Oh, is it? Well let's see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.
__Penny Oh, great. You know what? I've already mooched dinner off you guys. I don't need to listen to this.
__Howard There's your answer, free food.
__Sheldon All right, I've taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.
__Raj Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.
__Sheldon A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
__Sheldon Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.
__Howard Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
__Leonard Okay, we need to stop for a minute.
__Sheldon Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We'll need snacks.
__Leonard Sheldon, you're not in charge. It's my idea. I'm in charge.
__Sheldon Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You're clearly listed as founder.
__Leonard Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
__Sheldon You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.
__Leonard Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
__Raj Ooh. Leonard's going all alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass.
__Sheldon All right. All right, I'm not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.
__Leonard Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.
__Sheldon Good one, boss.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee's esprit de corps.
__Leonard It's not a joke. It's the real design.
__Sheldon In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?
__Leonard Sheldon, I think this will work. Let's just try it my way.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.
__Leonard Are you done?
__Sheldon If you say so, boss.
__Sheldon How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
__Raj So it spells Sheldon?
__Sheldon Does it? A happy accident.
__Leonard We're not doing names now. Howard?
__Howard Like I was saying, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
__Sheldon All right, fine. If we're not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.
__Leonard That's just Sheldon backwards.
__Sheldon Another happy accident.
__Leonard We're not wasting time with names right now.
__Sheldon I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
__Sheldon Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
__Leonard No.
__Howard Again, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
__Sheldon I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
__Leonard Oh Sheldon, stop it.
__Sheldon When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…
__Leonard That's enough, Sheldon.
__Leonard Okay, that's it, you're fired.
__Sheldon Really? Why?
__Leonard Because you're impossible to work with.
__Sheldon I see. And is that open for discussion?
__Sheldon Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you'll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.
__Leonard But I fired you.
__Sheldon Oh, I know. I'm now an independent contractor.
__Leonard No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
__Sheldon But I made it better.
__Leonard I don't want it better. I want it my way.
__Sheldon Well, that speaks volumes, doesn't it? All right, I suppose I'll go put on my bus pants.
__Leonard What the hell are bus pants?
__Sheldon They are pants one wears over one's regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you've lost touch with the struggles of the common man.
__Leonard Look, I'm still happy to drive you to work. Nothing's changed in that regard. We're still roommates, we're still friends.
__Sheldon Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.
__Leonard You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
__Howard It means after we play handball, I'm showering at home.
__Sheldon Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.
__Raj World's Greatest Astrophysicist?
__Sheldon Don't thank me. You earned it.
__Howard Howard Wolowitz. Why not World's Greatest Engineer?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.
__Howard We're not quitting on Leonard.
__Sheldon I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
__Raj What are you talking about?
__Sheldon Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I'll be back.
__Leonard Hold on. That's it!
__Howard Eureka!
__Raj Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.
__Raj No. The moment has passed.
__Sheldon Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?
__Raj You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?
__Sheldon Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?
__Leonard We're actually scanning equations and getting good results.
__Sheldon Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn't want to impede your progress.
__Howard No. It's a little tricky. I'm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
__Leonard What are you doing?!
__Sheldon Playing the theremin.
__Leonard No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?
__Sheldon Playing it. I've loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it's been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.
__Leonard Sheldon! We're working here!
__Sheldon That's all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin.  Well, that was a little uncalled for.
__Leonard No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.
__Sheldon So, your project is more important than mine?
__Leonard Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.
__Sheldon Don't beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don't want me here, just say the word, and I'll leave.
__Penny What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
__Sheldon I'm practicing my theremin.
__Penny Oh.
__Sheldon Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Glory, hallelujah.
__Penny Something got you down, there, Sheldon?
__Penny Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
__Sheldon He wouldn't drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
__Penny Is that so?
__Sheldon Yes. And they're still sticky.
__Penny Aw.
__Penny Hey, you don't need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.
__Sheldon With you?
__Penny Seriously, I have a great idea for one.
__Sheldon Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
__Penny Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.
__Sheldon That's your app idea?
__Penny Well, you don't like it?
__Sheldon I didn't say that. But no, I don't.
__Penny Why not?
__Penny And Leonard didn't want to work with you? Imagine that.
__Sheldon I know, it's baffling.  Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.
__Penny Sheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?
__Sheldon Do you make it with milk or water?
__Penny Milk.
__Sheldon Real cocoa?
__Penny That's what it says on the packet.
__Sheldon Do you have those little marshmallows?
__Penny No, sorry.
__Sheldon Well, I suppose it's appropriate.
__Penny What does that mean?
__Sheldon A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
__Leonard I'm telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We've got a hit.
__Raj What do you think we should sell it for?
__Howard Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I'd say about a million dollars a pop.
__Raj Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.
__Penny Hi. I'm sorry to bother you guys, but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.
__Leonard Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.
__Penny Look, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime?
__Leonard We're not playing. This is real work.
__Howard We're going to be hundred-aires.
__Penny Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
__Leonard Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we're doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.
__Penny Okay. Wait right here.
__Raj I'll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that's the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.
__Penny Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.
__Sheldon Well, we sure saw that coming.
__Penny That's right.
__Sheldon You know what I'm going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
__Penny No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody's suffered enough. The thing is, you're going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
__Sheldon How?
__Penny Say you're sorry.
__Sheldon Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn't raise her no liars.
__Penny Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you're always trying to learn about sarcasm?
__Sheldon No.
__Penny No?
__Sheldon I was being sarcastic.
__Penny Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you're sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.
__Sheldon Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.
__Penny Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let's go.
__Sheldon Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.
__Penny Oh, you're welcome.
__Sheldon Boy, I'm getting good at this.
__Sheldon Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.
__Sheldon Well, I must say, I am impressed.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Sheldon You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
__Howard We have.
__Sheldon As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let's start fresh. Howard, we're going to need some tea.
__Sheldon Bored.
__Penny Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.
__Sheldon Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm…
__Penny Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don't they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel's. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they're so cute…
__Sheldon Nobody knows the trouble I've seen, nobody knows my sorrow…
__Sheldon Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o'clock and order the same exact thing, and it's now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?
__Penny Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon's hamburger.
__Amy Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?
__Penny Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry, I'm actually pretty busy this weekend.
__Sheldon Probably serving food that was ordered today.
__Amy That's too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies' symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
__Penny The what?
__Leonard It's an annual science conference. We've all been invited to speak.
__Penny Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.
__Amy Shame. Since you're my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.
__Penny I'm your best friend?
__Amy Don't you read my blog?
__Penny Oh, don't feel bad. I never read Leonard's, and I used to sleep with him.
__Amy Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?
__Penny No, I really, I'm sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?
__Leonard I think her weekend just opened up.
__Leonard Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
__Penny You know, it is going to be difficult, but I'm going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.
__Amy Please don't touch my breasts.
__Penny I, I wasn't going to.
__Amy All right. I just want to establish boundaries.
__Penny Boy, this is great. I haven't had a vacation in ages.
__Sheldon In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.
__Penny You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don't piss off the people who handle the things you eat.
__Amy That does seem to be a valid principle.
__Sheldon I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers' Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”
__Amy I don't believe there's any such thing.
__Sheldon You lied to me?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Don't worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.
__Sheldon Raj? What are you doing? I don't think so. You've had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn't until the Denny's located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we're only as strong as our weakest bladder.
__Howard Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.
__Sheldon All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.
__Amy Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.
__Penny Yay!
__Sheldon She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.
__Penny Brawny?
__Leonard They're bigger than mine.
__Howard Fine.  Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
__Sheldon It's eleven fifteen. I'm requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
__Penny So, Amy, I've been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?
__Amy No, we discussed it. We decided we didn't want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.
__Sheldon Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone's toilet routine.
__Leonard I can vouch for that.
__Penny Hey.
__Leonard Not you, him.
__Penny Oh. Thanks.
__Leonard Although yours was an eye-opener.
__Amy Don't worry, Penny. You're my plus-one. You'll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I'm the ideal hotel roommate.
__Penny Terrific. Are we there yet?
__Howard Really? You want to see the keynote?
__Bernadette global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?
__Howard Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.
__Bernadette Really? And miss the keynote?
__Howard We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.
__Bernadette Well honey, if you're that tired, why don't you just take a nap here in the car?
__Howard No, see, it's not…
__Bernadette Hang on. It's Leonard. Hi, Leonard.
__Leonard Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.
__Bernadette Oh. Thank you, Raj.
__Sheldon No. Amy?
__Amy Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
__Sheldon No.
__Amy Are you in the lanthanoid series?
__Sheldon Amy, it's Penny's turn. Penny?
__Penny Uh, I don't know. Are you food?
__Sheldon That's not apropos. We've already established I'm found in the periodic table.
__Penny Well, it's a table, right? I mean, why can't there be food on it?
__Sheldon I knew she wasn't lead car material.
__Penny Who elected you Road Trip God?
__Sheldon Leonard.
__Leonard It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It's not technically Road Trip God, it's Travel Supervisor.
__Penny I don't understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What's he going to do?
__Howard What could we do? He's the Travel Supervisor.
__Bernadette Don't worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.
__Howard Yeah. It's the Love Car.
__Penny Should I ask?
__Bernadette They say we're young and we don't know, we won't find out until we grow.
__Howard Well, I don't know if all that's true, 'cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.
__Together Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe…
__Penny Red Leader, I'm really sorry.
__Amy I missed you.
__Penny You know what? I missed you, too.
__Very tall and powerfully built man Bernadette?
__Glenn Great to see you!
__Bernadette Are you here for the conference?
__Glenn Yeah, I'm doing a global warming panel.
__Bernadette Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.
__Glenn Oh. Nice to meet you.
__Howard Hi. Ow. Hi.
__Glenn You're a lucky man. Bernie's a great gal.
__Howard Yes. Bernie sure is.
__Glenn Well, I got to run. The panel's tomorrow morning. It' A Look Back.
__Bernadette I'll try to catch it.
__Glenn Oh, great. Bye.
__Bernadette Bye.
__Howard Hey, Bernie?
__Bernadette Yeah?
__Howard Please tell me he's your gay cousin.
__Bernadette No. He was one of my professors in college.
__Howard Oh! That's a relief.
__Bernadette Then we went out for a year. Come on, let's check in, so we can take that nap.
__Howard No, it's not necessarily proportional. Shut up!
__Bernadette Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
__Howard No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?
__Bernadette Six-seven.
__Howard Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
__Bernadette Is something bothering you?
__Howard No. It's just…
__Bernadette What?
__Howard I'm just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there's nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.
__Bernadette Howard, it's not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.
__Howard Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn't have a chance, right?
__Bernadette You can't think that way.
__Howard Yep. Loser.
__Bernadette Howard, stop it.
__Howard Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
__Bernadette Wait a minute, a girl like me? What's that mean?
__Howard I'm… I…
__Bernadette Are you saying you don't think I'm hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?
__Howard No! No, I'm saying exactly the opposite.
__Bernadette I'm too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
__Howard Yeah, let's go with that.
__Penny Will do.
__Amy So, girl talk?
__Penny Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?
__Penny Um, I never really thought about it. Why?
__Amy Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.
__Penny Really?
__Amy Not for sex, for convenience. You can't deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.
__Penny Again, I've never given it much thought.
__Amy We have time now. Think about it.
__Bernadette Can I stay here tonight?
__Penny Yeah. Why, what happened?
__Bernadette Howard's a complete and total ass.
__Penny Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.
__Bernadette Thanks. I'll sleep on the floor.
__Amy Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
__Penny We are?
__Penny Oh, right, right, the blog.
__Amy Word of warning, though. I'm prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don't panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I'll be fine.
__Leonard Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon's asleep. What's going on?
__Penny Well, Howard's a complete and total ass, Bernadette's in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy's hair, she bites.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
__Leonard Uh, sure.
__Penny All right.
__Leonard So, how do you wanna do this?
__Penny Well, I'm not getting in bed with him.
__Leonard Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula's coffin.
__Leonard Okay, when you say make the best of it.
__Penny Sleep.
__Leonard Right. So we'll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
__Penny The what?
__Leonard Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.
__Penny Oh, okay. Just like old times.
__Leonard Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.
__Penny Sweetie, let me put this in a way you'll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.
__Leonard Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?
__Penny Go to sleep.
__Leonard Good night.
__Sheldon Please tell me you're not having coitus.
__Penny We are not having coitus.
__Sheldon Can you guarantee that it won't happen at any time during the night?
__Penny Yes.
__Leonard No.
__Raj Oh, my God, I'm crying already.
__Sheldon Raj?  Raj?  Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
__Raj Why?
__Sheldon Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny's bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.
__Raj Okay. Come on in.
__Leonard No.
__Penny I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
__Leonard Sure, no problem.
__Penny I know it's kinda weird.
__Leonard True dat.
__Penny True dat?
__Leonard I've gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
__Penny Right. Still mad at me about that?
__Leonard No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard I've gotten a lot better at that, you know. I've dated four different women since we broke up and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.
__Penny Good for you.
__Leonard Okay, good night.
__Penny Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!
__Raj Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.
__Leonard Penny's here.  No, we don't want to watch Bridget Jones's Diary!
__Bernadette Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It's not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.
__Howard Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.
__Bernadette I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
__Amy Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I'd like to weigh in.
__Sheldon Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?
__Raj Certainly. I'd like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.
__Leonard I'd like to kick your little brown ass.
__Raj What did I do?
__Leonard Oh, I don't know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.
__Penny We weren't getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
__Sheldon Excuse me. We're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
__Penny Oh, shut up, Sheldon!
__Amy Hi, bestie.
__Penny Yeah, hi.
__Sheldon All right, why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic.
__Howard Let me ask you something, Bernie.
__Sheldon I guess not.
__Howard How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
__Bernadette Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.
__Howard What, I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?
__Raj I'd like to weigh in here. No.
__Sheldon All right, why don't we open it up to Q&A from the audience?
__Penny Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?
__Glenn I'm driving back to L.A. tonight.
__Bernadette Um, Penny, that's Glenn. Glenn, that's Penny.
__Leonard No!
__Amy Leonard, can I ask you a question?
__Leonard Sure.
__Amy Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I've ever seen in my life?
__Leonard No. Why do you ask?
__Amy Because we're going 120 miles per hour.
__Sheldon All right, if no one's going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.
__Howard Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein's theory explain why time flies when you're having fun, but when you're listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?
__Raj Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.
__Leonard Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
__Howard Apparently, if you're Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.
__Penny Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can't get on.
__Leonard Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It's now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.
__Penny Thanks. What are you guys doing?
__Leonard Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We're reading the reviews.
__Penny Oh. How'd he do?
__Howard Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.
__Penny That bad, huh?
__Leonard Read this woman's tweet.
__Penny Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.
__Howard So, how'd the lecture go?
__Leonard In a word, triumphant.
__Leonard Really? Triumphant?
__Sheldon Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.
__Penny Oh, please let me tell him.
__Leonard I don't know, I kind of promised Howard.
__Sheldon Tell me what?
__Howard Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.
__Sheldon Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That's rather unfair. That's downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I'm not familiar with the acronym KMN.
__Leonard Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.
__Sheldon Well, I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion. I think I'll turn in. I didn't want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.
__Howard FYI, I think that's what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.
__Leonard Yeah, it's weird. Even though he didn't want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.
__Raj Mmm, I know the feeling. It's like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.
__Bernadette Are you guys doing okay?
__Howard Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.
__Bernadette Well, that shouldn't be too hard. He's such a cutie.
__Raj Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.
__Howard Labradoodle?
__Leonard We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
__Bernadette Don't you listen to them. You've got plenty of sex appeal.
__Raj You really think so?
__Bernadette Yeah. You're a hottie.
__Raj Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.
__Sheldon It's a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.
__Amy Not even when I do this?
__Sheldon No.
__Amy Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.
__Sheldon Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I've failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
__Amy If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.
__Sheldon For instance?
__Amy Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.
__Sheldon Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.
__Amy All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?
__Sheldon Isn't that their burden? I'm the one with something interesting to say.
__Amy Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.
__Sheldon I sense that you're trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
__Amy Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.
__Sheldon Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon You're an  actress, correct?
__Penny I'm not an actress. I'm an actress.
__Sheldon All right. You're an actress. I need you to teach me.
__Penny You want an acting lesson?
__Sheldon Perhaps two. I'd like to master the craft.
__Penny Okay, where is this coming from?
__Sheldon It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.
__Penny Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.
__Sheldon So, when could we start?
__Sheldon I suppose that's one way to look at it.
__Penny I think it's the only way to look at it.
__Sheldon Are you going to help me or not?
__Penny Probably. I'm just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one's career had reached the end of the road.
__Penny Forget it.
__Sheldon I'll pay you 40 dollars.
__Penny Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.
__Raj What?
__Howard I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.
__Raj Dude, that's incredible!
__Howard I know. The only thing is, I'm gonna be gone for two years.
__Raj Aw, I'm gonna miss you. Are you going with him?
__Bernadette I have to stay here for school.
__Howard That's what we're here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.
__Raj What kind of needs?
__Howard Sexual needs.
__Bernadette Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.
__Howard So, while I'm gone, you're going to have to satisfy her.
__Bernadette What do you say?
__Raj I say okey-dokey.
__Howard What ya thinking so hard about?
__Raj Just that I'm definitely not gay.
__Penny What's wrong?
__Sheldon Nothing. I was acting.
__Penny You were acting?
__Sheldon Yes. In preparation for today's studies, I read Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler's
__ The Technique of Acting, Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting, and Henry Winkler's Heyyy, I'm an Actor.
__ Well, good for you. Come on in.
__Sheldon How shall we begin?
__Penny Well, I thought we'd start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?
__Sheldon You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you're doing.
__Penny Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.
__Sheldon Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.
__Penny All right, let's just say we've warmed up.
__Sheldon You're the teacher.
__Penny Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don't we try some improvisation?
__Sheldon Why not? It seems like you're improvising your entire curriculum.
__Penny This is all about listening and responding.
__Sheldon Gotcha.
__Penny I'm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny All right.
__Sheldon Action.
__Penny Okay, it's not a movie. It's improv. So no one calls action.
__Sheldon Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?
__Penny Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?
__Penny Yogurt?
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Penny Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.
__Sheldon You do?
__Penny Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.
__Sheldon All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon It's the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
__Penny Okay, you know what? Let's just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.
__Sheldon Oh, and we're going to use props?
__Penny You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?
__Sheldon You have any frozen yogurt?
__Raj Uh-huh.
__Leonard Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?
__Raj What happened?
__Leonard Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He's in critical condition.
__Raj Oh, no!
__Leonard Have you seen him?
__Bernadette They wouldn't let me in. Oh my Howie.
__Leonard It'll be okay. It'll be okay.
__Raj It'll be okay. It'll be okay.  It's Howard. Howard, hello.
__Howard Raj, is that you?
__Raj Yeah, I'm right here, buddy. How are you?
__Raj No, no, no, don't say that. You're going to be all right.
__Howard Raj, I don't have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.
__Raj Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean…
__Bernadette Sexually.
__Raj Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.
__Howard Sexually.
__Raj Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.
__Bernadette That's how I heard it.
__Leonard Leonard (out of Raj's daydream): Or it could be sy-fee.
__Leonard S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
__Raj Oh, right. Good one.
__Sheldon Yes. I didn't care for it.
__Penny Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.
__Sheldon So is the McRib sandwich. I don't care for that, either.
__Penny Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
__Sheldon I'm glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.
__Penny And you think it's better than Tennessee Williams?
__Sheldon Why don't we leave that for future generations to decide?
__Penny Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
__Sheldon It's the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.
__Penny KMN.
__Sheldon Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon's mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.
__Penny Okay, that's fine, but let's try and get you out of your comfort zone.
__Sheldon Why would we want to do that? It's called the comfort zone for a reason.
__Penny Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. You'll be Spock?
__Penny It's only logical.
__Sheldon Very well. I'll set the scene.
__Penny All right.
__Sheldon East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.
__Penny Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.
__Sheldon Hoo!
__Penny Now just read your mother's line.
__Sheldon Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I'll never understand that boy. But then again, I'm a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.
__Penny Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
__Sheldon Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain't foolin' no one, and get your shotgun!
__Penny Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I just don't buy it.
__Penny Just keep going!
__Sheldon Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.
__Penny We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.
__Sheldon I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man's here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.”
__Penny Okay, okay, let's try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.
__Sheldon Why?
__Penny Well, you're losing your son.
__Sheldon Yes, but he's going to a better place where he won't get beat up. So much.
__Penny All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you're sad to see him go. I'm gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That's your cue.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
__Penny All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.
__Sheldon Oh, Shelly? A man's here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.
__Penny That's good. That's good. That's good.
__Sheldon Mommy, why are you crying? ‘Cause I'm gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.
__Penny Okay, I guess we're improvising now.
__Sheldon Well I'm sorry. It's not my fault. I'm just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don't you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy's late for Indian bingo.
__Penny Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.
__Sheldon Mommy, I love you. Don't let Spock take me to the future!
__ Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!
__Bernadette Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
__Raj My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!
__Bernadette My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
__Bernadette My universe!
__Raj You are my heart!
__Bernadette My universe!
__Both together My universe!
__Chorus of everyone in cafeteria Hey! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! My universe!
__Raj Dance number aside, I'm so not gay.
__Howard You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can't see themselves in the mirror?
__Sheldon Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.
__Raj Yeah, okay, so, zombies.
__Leonard I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn't eat, they starved.
__Howard You're thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
__Raj Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.
__Leonard Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o'clock.
__Howard Why's the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
__Sheldon Perhaps he's emulating Shakespeare's Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he'd have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I've sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.
__Raj Or maybe he heard it's Tator Tot Tuesday. That's why I'm here.
__Dr. Seibert Hey, there's my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?
__Sheldon That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?
__Seibert Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.
__Sheldon It's not a touch phobia, it's a germ phobia. If you'd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,
__ I'll let you check me for a hernia.
__ Yeah. So, listen, fellas, who's up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.
__Raj Sounds great!
__Howard I'm in!
__Sheldon Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn't mean you should jump into his windowless van. What's the occasion?
__Seibert Just a little fund-raiser for the university.
__Sheldon Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
__Seibert I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.
__Sheldon I don't care, it's demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don't want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign's uniform.
__Seibert All right, let me put it this way. You're gonna put on a suit, you're gonna come to this party, and you're gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people, or I swear to God, I'll blind you with a hot spoon, like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.
__Raj Oh, you don't want that.
__Seibert So, Saturday night! It's gonna be off the hook.
__Sheldon Ugh!
__Seibert Get over it.
__Raj Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Are you sure this is right?
__Penny Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  you'll be fine.
__Howard Okay, let's go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.
__Penny Oh, Howard, I can't believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.
__Howard Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn't pick out my clothes. My mother does.
__Leonard Oh. We should get going.
__Howard What about Sheldon?
__Sheldon Sheldon is not going.
__Leonard Really? What do we tell Siebert?
__Sheldon Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
__Penny Sheldon, it's Saturday night, you'll be doing laundry.
__Sheldon Don't tell him that, tell him the mask thing.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Raj Nice place. Reminds me of my parents' house back in New Delhi.
__Howard You're kidding.
__Raj No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.
__Leonard More than this?
__Raj More than we can use. You see, in India, we don't make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.
__Seibert Ah. There's my band of brainiacs. Where's Dr. Cooper?
__Seibert The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind. I think he's just bananas. Come on, let me introduce you to one of the university's leading donors.
__Raj I think we were misled about the cute girls.
__Seibert Mrs. Latham, I'd like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.
__Mrs Latham Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn't stick with it long enough to get your PhD?
__Howard I'm an engineer. Most engineers don't bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.
__Mrs Latham Got it, you're a space plumber.
__Howard I'm gonna go hit the bar.
__Mrs Latham Tell me about these two.
__Raj Do him first.
__Seibert Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight. I think you'll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.
__Mrs Latham Right. Fascinate me.
__Leonard Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
__Mrs Latham They're cute when they're about to wet themselves, aren't they? I'll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?
__Leonard Coffee maker?
__Mrs Latham All right, Dr. Kooth… uh, whatever it is, you're up.
__Raj It's Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.
__Amy Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you've made a foolish mistake.
__Sheldon Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I'm not above minimizing your window.
__Amy Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.
__Sheldon That's it. Prepare to be minimized.
__Amy I'm not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?
__ I went to Saudi Arabia and met with a prince who had an interest in neurobiology.
__ Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
__Sheldon Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.
__Amy And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.
__Sheldon Are you trying to scare me? ‘Cause you're succeeding.
__Amy Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year's donations might go to, say, the geology department.
__Sheldon Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!
__Amy Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.
__Sheldon No!
__Amy Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.
__Sheldon Oh, the humanities!
__Raj Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?
__Leonard Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.
__Mrs Latham Oh, you didn't do that badly.
__Leonard Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, 'cause it needs to warm up.
__Mrs Latham I no longer care, dear. But don't worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.
__Leonard You're kidding. That was good for you? ‘Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
__Mrs Latham Excellent! There's nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.
__Leonard Why?
__Mrs Latham Oh, I don't know, it's one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun.
__Sheldon No, no, no, I'm just here for your money. I don't want to shake anyone's germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert.
__ Good morning, Mrs. Latham. Well, yes, of course I remember you. A woman well past her prime seeking to augment her social status by doling out her late husband's ill-gotten gains. So, how much money are you going to give me? I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested. Well, if you're not going to give me money, then why are you calling? She wants to talk to you. Who's crazy now?
__Sheldon Okay, I see what's happening.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon My stature intimidates her, so she's using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.
__Leonard Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I've been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.
__Sheldon No, that can't be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we're best friends. And I got your back, Jack.
__Secne Mrs Latham's car.
__Leonard That was a great meal.
__Mrs Latham I'm glad you enjoyed it.
__Leonard The only time I eat this well is when my mom's in town and she takes me out to dinner.
__Mrs Latham Is that so?
__Leonard You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.
__Mrs Latham Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.
__Leonard No kidding.
__Mrs Latham Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he'd had money.
__Mrs Latham Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.
__Leonard Oh, good, good.
__Mrs Latham And I'm seriously considering taking it to the next level.
__Leonard Terrific. Great. What level is that?  Okay, now you don't remind me of my mom.
__Penny Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.
__Sheldon You know, it's a shame, all that work she's doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.
__Howard Hey. How was dinner?
__Leonard Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
__Sheldon No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It'll take two weeks.
__Penny Leonard, are you okay?
__Leonard Um, I'm not sure.
__Howard What's going on?
__Leonard Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
__Sheldon Oh, wow!
__Howard Yes!
__Leonard Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
__Sheldon Why?
__Penny Okay, we can't keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.
__Leonard She hit on me.
__Howard Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
__Leonard I think so.
__Howard You lucky duck.
__Penny You're really a broken toy, aren't you?
__Leonard I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.
__Sheldon Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Penny, you're an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.
__Leonard Well, n-no, hold on a second, I'm not going to sleep with her.
__Sheldon But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
__Leonard Well, forget it! It's not gonna happen.
__Sheldon Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!
__Leonard I repeat, not gonna happen.
__Penny What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
__Sheldon It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
__Leonard I won't be too late. I'm just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
__Sheldon Hold on, I have something for you.
__Leonard What's this?
__Sheldon Just a few things you may need tonight. There's, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.
__Leonard I am not going to have sex with her.
__Sheldon Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
__Leonard Are you insane? I'm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
__Sheldon Oh, come on! Why not?
__Leonard Good night, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!
__Penny He still won't shag the old lady, huh?
__Sheldon No. But thank you for asking.
__Mrs Latham Hello, Leonard. I hope you're hungry.
__Leonard I'm very hungry. For food, right?
__Mrs Latham Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night. I'm so sorry.
__Leonard No, that's okay.
__Mrs Latham No, it most certainly is not. Leonard, I'm making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.
__Leonard Really?
__Mrs Latham Well, of course. There's no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.
__Leonard Oh. Then what was last night about?
__Mrs Latham I took a shot, sue me.
__Leonard Oh.
__Mrs Latham You're a very handsome man, Leonard.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Mrs Latham It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.
__Leonard Oh, don't say that. You're a very attractive woman.
__Mrs Latham Oh, please.
__Leonard No, it's true.
__Mrs Latham Well, aren't you sweet. Just for the record, you'd remember a night with me for the rest of your life.
__Leonard I'm sure I would. But why, why, exactly?
__Mrs Latham You're a very smart man. How do you think I landed such a rich husband?
__Leonard I hadn't really given it much thought.
__Mrs Latham Well, think about it.
__Leonard Do you mean?
__Mrs Latham Yep. I'm that good.
__Leonard Oh, what the hell.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you're missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.
__Sheldon What's going on?
__Leonard Oh, nothing's going on. Excuse me.
__Sheldon Are you just getting home?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon That's a good sign, right?
__Penny Oh, yeah.
__Sheldon I'm so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
__Leonard No, I didn't do it for the money.
__Sheldon She stiffed you?
__Penny I believe that's what your roommate did to her.
__Sheldon What?
__Penny Again, read the book we gave you.
__Leonard No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.
__Sheldon Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.
__Leonard Uh, I'm gonna go lie down.
__Sheldon That's a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn't learn anything from his relationship with you.
__Penny Hey!
__Sheldon Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.
__Leonard I didn't do it for the money!
__Seibert Keep telling yourself that, it makes it easier. Trust me, I know.
__Raj Cool, buddy! That's awesome!
__Howard How was she?
__ Episode begins with a “Previously on” sequence before first scene.
__Bernadette Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
__Howard I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don't I?
__Bernadette It's cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
__Howard You know it's meant as a compliment.
__Bernadette That's how I take it.
__Howard This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.
__Bernadette Me too.
__Howard Well, gotta go.
__Bernadette Oh! Already? Why don't you stay over?
__Howard Well, I'd love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.
__Bernadette Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.
__Howard It's not just the wig. It's pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It's a two-person job.
__Bernadette It's just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.
__Howard Oh, honey, I'm sorry. What can I do?
__Bernadette Stay.
__Howard Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?
__Bernadette Go home.
__Howard Your call.
__Howard Boy, I don't know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?
__Bernadette No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.
__Howard I've got a better solution.
__Bernadette What?
__Howard We wait for my mom's heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.
__Bernadette Great.
__Howard Sex criminals don't have keys, Ma.
__Mrs Wolowitz Where were you so late?
__Howard I was out with Bernadette.
__Mrs Wolowitz I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!
__Howard I'm not having this conversation with you, Ma!
__Mrs Wolowitz God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!
__Howard Nobody has a disease!
__Mrs Wolowitz I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?
__Howard That's it. I don't have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
__Mrs Wolowitz Who's there? Are you a sex criminal?
__Howard I'm still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard I need a place to crash.
__Leonard Uh, sure. Why?
__Howard Big fight with my mother.
__Leonard Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
__Howard No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.
__Sheldon What's going on?
__Leonard Howard's gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
__Sheldon Did you offer him a hot beverage?
__Leonard No.
__Howard Tea does sound nice.
__Sheldon You heard the man, Leonard. And while you're at it, I'm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn't you seek refuge under his roof?
__Leonard Wait, wait. What?
__Sheldon Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I'm down in the dumps here.
__Leonard Priya's in town?
__Howard Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette…
__Leonard Hold on. When did Priya get here?
__Howard I don't know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn't like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn't trust Bernadette.
__Leonard Yeah, that's a real pickle. Bye.
__Sheldon Don't worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.
__Howard That's not really necessary.
__Sheldon No, no. I'll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever's troubling you.
__Howard Thanks.
__Sheldon That's what tertiary friends are for.
__Leonard It's Leonard.
__Raj You can't come in.
__Leonard I just want to talk to her.
__Raj I forbid it.
__Priya Open the door, Rajesh.
__Raj You heard me. I forbidded it.
__Priya Forbidded it?
__Raj Forbaded it?
__Priya Get out of the way. What are you doing here?
__Leonard What are you doing here?
__Priya I have business in Los Angeles.
__Leonard Why didn't you call?
__Raj Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.
__Priya I'm sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn't sure if seeing you was such a good idea.
__Leonard I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
__Raj No!
__Priya Sure.
__Raj It's completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I'll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me.  Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.
__Howard That's very nice of you, but I made other plans.
__Sheldon Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.
__Priya Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.
__Howard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
__Priya Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.
__Raj Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.
__Leonard The word is forbade.
__Raj Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.
__Priya Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don't get to tell me who I can and can't have a relationship with.
__Sheldon Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman's father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.
__Raj There it is, Priya. We're Indian. We believe this stuff.
__Priya I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.
__Raj Some of it makes sense, some of it's crazy. My point is, you can't go out with Leonard.
__Penny Who can't go out with Leonard?
__Raj My sister.
__Leonard Penny, this is Raj's sister, Priya.
__Priya It's very nice to meet you.
__Penny Oh, yeah, you, too.
__Sheldon Priya, if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.
__Penny Sheldon!
__Leonard Really?
__Howard Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?
__Bernadette Sure.
__Raj Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?
__Howard Listen, my mom's going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That's two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I'll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.
__Bernadette That's it? That's your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom's nose holds up, we get two nights together?
__Bernadette No, it's not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.
__Howard Oh, uh…
__Bernadette Wrong answer.
__Howard No, wait. You didn't let me finish.
__Bernadette I'm listening.
__Howard Uh…
__Bernadette Agh!
__Penny Okay. Why?
__Amy To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh's sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.
__Penny Amy, I'm fine.
__Amy You don't have to be strong for me. Now let's talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.
__Penny What?
__Amy In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.
__Penny Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.
__Amy Oh. Then perhaps you don't understand what's going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.
__Penny Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?
__Amy Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she's an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.
__Penny Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?
__Amy This is a portable electroencephalogram. I'm doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I'm going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?
__Bernadette Really?
__Howard Yep. I moved out of my mother's house. Cord is cut. I'm all yours.
__Bernadette What did she say when you told her?
__Howard I don't know. She hasn't responded to my email yet.
__Bernadette This is so great. I love you, Howard.
__Howard I love you, too. So what's for dinner?
__Bernadette Well, I don't really have much of anything in the house.
__Howard That's fine. Why don't we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.
__Leonard I love the way you say, I'd love that.
__Raj She says it the same way I do. I'd love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It's not a big deal.
__Priya Rajesh, don't be a child.
__Raj I'm not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.
__Leonard My sister's 38 and married.
__Raj All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
__Penny Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.
__Sheldon That's remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation's airports.
__Priya Hi. Penny, right?
__Penny Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company. I don't want to impose.
__Sheldon No, no. It's not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.
__Penny If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn't have to take that.
__Amy Hi, bestie.
__Penny Hi. So, um, Priya, you're a lawyer, right?
__Priya I know. Pretty boring, huh?
__Leonard Oh, come on. It's not boring at all. She's currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?
__Priya Thank you, Leonard. That doesn't make it sound boring at all.
__Amy So, how you holding up?
__Penny I'm fine.
__Amy Oh, who are you kidding? She's breathtaking.
__Priya So, Penny, Leonard tells me you're an actress. That must be pretty exciting.
__Penny Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.
__Sheldon Did you get the part?
__Penny I didn't do the audition.
__Sheldon Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?
__Priya I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.
__Leonard Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.
__Priya In his tongue.
__Leonard Whose tongue?
__Priya Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.
__Leonard What, with my tongue in your tail?
__Amy I'm regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.
__Howard Wow, indeed.
__Bernadette I can't believe we're finally living together.
__Howard Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?
__Bernadette What?
__Howard A little snack. You got any string cheese?
__Bernadette No. I, I might have some cheddar.
__Howard Not as good. You can't make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.
__Bernadette Okay.
__Howard You have hypo-allergenic detergent?
__Bernadette No.
__Howard Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.
__Bernadette Wait a second. I'm doing your laundry?
__Howard Well, honey, it's not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you're driving me to the dentist.
__Bernadette I have to take you?
__Howard You don't have to take me. You get to take me.
__Bernadette Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
__Howard It's not weird. There's lots of kids there with their moms.
__Howard What? It's fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.
__Bernadette All right, Howard, let's get something straight right now. I'm not going to be your mother.
__Howard Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?
__Howard Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.
__Mrs Wolowitz Where were you?
__Howard Didn't you read my email?
__Mrs Wolowitz You know I can't turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.
__Howard Thank you.
__Mrs Wolowitz Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!
__Amy I just wanted to check in on you.
__Penny Why?
__Amy It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one's best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.
__Penny I already told you, I'm okay with it. I mean, if anything, I'm quite pleased  that Leonard has found someone  that makes him so happy.
__Amy It's okay, it's okay.
__Penny Thank you.
__Amy Now, let's get these electrodes attached and see what's going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon It's actually Thai. You're slipping.
__Penny Are Leonard and Priya here?
__Sheldon They went to Catalina for the weekend.
__Penny Oh. Where's Raj?
__Sheldon At home, forbidding it.
__Penny How about Howard?
__Sheldon I'm given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
__Penny Oh, okay. Well, I guess it's just the two of us, huh?
__Sheldon Actually, it's the three of us.
__Amy What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.
__Penny Great.
__Amy So, you feeling better?
__Penny Not really.
__Amy Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.
__Sheldon Right. I'll make tea.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. It's not optional.
__Leonard Okay, I'm out of here.
__Sheldon Un momento. Oh, for heaven's sake, now you're being deliberately stupid.  Where are you going?
__Leonard I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's. I think Howard's going to be there. You want to join us?
__Sheldon But tonight's Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.
__Leonard Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight?
__Sheldon We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.
__Leonard Just come with me to Raj's.
__Sheldon Well, I don't want to go to a party.
__Leonard It's not a party. It's the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.
__Leonard How come it's not a party when we do it here?
__Sheldon Because we don't throw parties.
__Leonard I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon. I'm going to see Priya. Everyone's over there. You coming or not?
__Sheldon Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.
__Leonard I guess you're right. See you later.
__Sheldon Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
__Leonard Come with me to Raj's and eat there.
__Sheldon I can't do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
__Leonard I really doubt that's what he'll serve.
__Sheldon But what if he does? I'll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep's stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don't know why he's serving both.
__Leonard What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?
__Sheldon No, I'll go to your haggis party. But I'm telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.
__ Credits sequence.
__ Oh, dear!
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Raj's television. I just realized we're about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
__Leonard So don't watch TV. Read a book.
__Sheldon And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that's not my style.
__Leonard Ugh!
__Sheldon The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?
__Leonard Right.
__Sheldon Is it about me or the dead pixels?
__Raj Hey, you're just in time. We made Tex-Mex.
__Leonard Oh, sounds great.
__Sheldon Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.
__Priya Hey, you.
__Leonard Hi.
__Howard That's got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister's mouth?
__Sheldon Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.
__Priya There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.
__Sheldon Oh, what fun. We're like hippies at a love-in.
__Leonard Just sit here.
__Sheldon Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it's Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer's Stone.
__Raj Okay, we've got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.
__Sheldon Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.
__Priya Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?
__Sheldon A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
__Sheldon Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
__Penny Where are all your friends?
__Sheldon Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon Excuse me? Isn't this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
__Penny Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What's troubling you, buddy?
__Sheldon I don't think your heart's in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj's sister, we're all forced to hang out at his apartment.
__Penny Oh, the horror.
__Sheldon Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.  Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?
__Penny Ugh!
__Sheldon Wonder what she's exasperated about. Hello?
__Amy Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj's, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.
__Sheldon Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn't look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.
__Penny There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
__Amy Hi, bestie.
__Penny Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?
__Amy Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.
__Penny Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?
__Sheldon Don't worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
__Penny Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you're all probably gonna be hanging out there more.
__Amy Penny, I'm sorry you got dragged into this. I know you're devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.
__Penny Okay, I'm not upset about Leonard and Priya.
__Amy Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
__Sheldon Cluck-cluck-cluck.
__Amy Sheldon, look at me. I think it's time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.
__Sheldon Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I'm the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
__Amy I'm not saying that you're not fun. You're the most fun person I know.
__Penny A lot of people think I'm fun to be around.
__Amy Don't be needy, bestie. That's probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we'd all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.
__Penny Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you'd be called Leonard and the Leonards.
__Amy So needy.
__Sheldon I'm setting out snacks.
__Leonard You do realize everyone's eating at Raj's again tonight?
__Sheldon I didn't say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?
__Leonard You're having people over?
__Leonard Really? LeVar Burton's coming here?
__Sheldon Possibly. I Tweeted him.
__Leonard Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.
__Sheldon Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.
__Leonard Of course. Good night.
__Sheldon Leonard.
__Leonard Yeah?
__Sheldon We had a good run, you and I.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon But change is a part of life.
__Leonard It certainly is.
__Sheldon Okay. I have guests coming. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.
__Leonard I am leaving.
__Sheldon Don't make this harder than it is, Leonard.
__Leonard Good-bye, Sheldon.
__Sheldon And good-bye to you, sir. He'll be back.
__Leonard Of course I'll be back. I live here!
__Stuart Um. Hi. I'm Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I'm currently living in. And I guess what I'm hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.
__Sheldon That's very nice, Stuart. Zack?
__Zack I'm Zack, and I'm, uh… uh… could you come back to me?
__Sheldon Of course. Barry?
__Barry I'm Barry Kwipke, and I'm here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?
__Sheldon Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.
__Barry One more question…
__Sheldon Yes, you must be present to win.
__Zack Okay, I'm ready. I'm Zack, and I'm, uh… oh, crap, why is this so hard?
__Bernadette Hi.
__Penny What's up?
__Bernadette We're here to kidnap you for a girls' night out.
__Amy Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.
__Penny I kind of figured that.
__Amy Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.
__Penny No.
__Amy She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.
__Bernadette We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.
__Penny Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.
__Penny Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?
__Amy Yes.
__Bernadette Sure.
__Penny All right. I'll go change. Come on in.
__Amy If you'd have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn't have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.
__Sheldon Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
__Barry Weally? That's your question?
__Zack What's the difference?
__Sheldon Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.
__Zack Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?
__Sheldon Surprisingly, yes.
__Zack Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?
__Stuart Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I'd like something to think about in the shower.
__Zack Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice…
__Sheldon The water level rose.
__Zack No.
__Sheldon Of course it did. It's said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.
__Barry Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.
__Sheldon Forgive me, but I think you'll find my story is more interesting.
__Barry Does yours have wet bweasts in it?
__Sheldon Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.
__Zack So, long story short, I nailed her.
__Sheldon When he finished, he shouted Eureka!
__Zack No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don't know why. Just do.
__Sheldon All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who's ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight's selections include ColecoVision's Smurf Rescue in Gargamel's Castle, Atari's Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I'm fun.
__Barry That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?
__Zack Great, I'll make a beer run.
__Stuart And I'll take a shower. We'll meet back here in fifteen.
__Barry Check.
__Sheldon I'm unhappy.
__Priya When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.
__Leonard I hope she wasn't anything like my flatmate from Texas.
__Priya Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn't he?
__Howard Oh, please. That crazy bastard's looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.
__Leonard Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.
__Howard Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?
__Priya Oh, God, you're kidding.
__Raj Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren't so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”
__Leonard Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
__Raj I'd like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
__Leonard Hear, hear.
__Priya Why is it called a toast?
__Leonard Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
__Raj Sheldon tells it better.
__Leonard He kind of does.
__Howard Yeah.
__Leonard Aw, hell, I miss him.
__Bernadette We were hoping you'd know a place.
__Amy Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.
__Penny Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?
__Amy That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.
__Penny Okay, let's go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.
__Bernadette But you could if you wanted to, right?
__Penny Well, yeah, I guess.
__Bernadette Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?
__Penny More or less.
__Amy What's that like?
__Penny I don't know. It's fun while you're doing it. And then after, it's mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.
__Bernadette I would take that deal all day long.
__Penny Yeah, well, it's not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I'm totally okay with it.
__Amy You know, if being on your own is new to you, I'd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I've perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?
__Penny Um, no.
__Amy You should get one.
__Amy It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
__Penny Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.
__Penny Yeah, it was.
__Bernadette Leonard's really one of a kind.
__Amy Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don't you think?
__Penny Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let's go find me a heinie to bite.
__Bernadette That's kind of creepy.
__Sheldon No.
__Stuart Dibs.
__Leonard He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
__Raj I still wear mine when there's a nip in the air.
__Priya Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?
__Leonard Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
__Sheldon All my friends.  All my friends.  All my friends.
__Howard I think it's like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.
__Raj Come on in.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Leonard Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
__Sheldon I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
__Priya Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Priya Would you like some homemade chili?
__Sheldon Are there beans in it?
__Priya Yes.
__Sheldon Then it's not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you're from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.
__Priya Sheldon, do you want some or not?
__Sheldon Yes, please. Your girlfriend's a little short-tempered.
__Raj I'd like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.
__All Cheers.
__Sheldon Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?
__Priya Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
__Sheldon She's also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.
__Leonard Morning.
__Priya Sure.
__Leonard Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?
__Priya Yeah, just because you're in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?
__Leonard Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I'd be okay with that.
__Priya No, you have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought about getting contacts?
__Leonard I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
__Priya Oh, that's too bad.
__Leonard Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.
__Leonard Th-th-th-that's okay. I can infer from context.
__Sheldon Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you're just an engineer, but that doesn't mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else's Nobel prize acceptance speech.
__Raj Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let's see it.
__Howard Here, shuffle these.
__Howard Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it.
__Raj Okay.
__Howard Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.
__Sheldon Is it any wonder he doesn't have a doctorate?
__Howard Remind me, what's your birthday?
__Raj October sixth.
__Howard Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.
__Raj How about that!
__Raj Yes, it is. Very cool!
__Sheldon It's not cool. It's a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How'd you do it?
__Howard A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.
__Sheldon Fine. Give me a second.
__Howard You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?
__ Oh, hey!
__Leonard Sorry! Oop!
__ Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I'm so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.
__Howard That's your card, right?
__Penny Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
__Sheldon It's not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
__Howard Oh, really? So how did I do it?
__Sheldon Well, I don't care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.
__Howard I thought you had more important things to think about.
__Sheldon I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.
__Penny Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
__Sheldon Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
__Penny Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Priya Lets go hang everything up.
__Leonard Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.
__Howard So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
__Penny I'm not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.
__Howard Yeah, I was talking to Raj.
__Penny Oopsy.
__Howard Fine. Get another deck and I'll do the trick with that.
__Sheldon So you're saying this is a regulation deck?
__Howard I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.
__Leonard Just two. Everyday and dress.
__Priya Uh-huh. Listen, we need to talk about something.
__Leonard Oh, my god, you're breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.
__Priya Leonard, I'm not breaking up with you.
__Leonard Oh, okay. So, what's up?
__Priya It's a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.
__Leonard I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.
__Priya I'm just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?
__Leonard Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.
__Priya I don't care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you're not ready to move on.
__Leonard No, no-no-no, I'm ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that's not moving on, what is?
__Priya You need to cut the cord with Penny.
__Leonard Oh. Okay.
__Priya You don't sound very confident.
__Leonard No, no, I'm confident. It's not like I'm unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I'll be the one saying it.
__Priya Thank you. I appreciate it.
__Leonard Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?
__Priya Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe. Can we not discuss it?
__Leonard I'm sorry. I'm, never mind.
__Penny Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?
__Sheldon Um…
__Penny Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can't figure out how I got his nose.
__Howard You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil's rubber!
__Penny Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.
__Sheldon Oh, oh, please, if I don't know, you don't know. That's axiomatic.
__Penny Come here.
__Howard You're right.
__Penny Not too bad for someone who doesn't know what axiomatic means.
__Leonard One of them's upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
__Penny Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny You don't wanna wash that.
__Leonard No?
__Penny No, that's silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.
__Leonard Yeah, me, too.
__Penny She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.
__Leonard Yeah, bitches are the worst.
__Penny All right, well I'll see you later.
__Leonard Uh, Penny, there's something I have to tell you.
__Penny What?
__Penny Did they make a movie about it?
__Leonard No.
__Penny Then no.
__Leonard All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
__Penny Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?
__Leonard Sure, that has birds in it.
__Penny It's fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.
__Leonard I'm sorry, but I'm gonna count that.
__Leonard Yeah. The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
__Leonard Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.
__Priya And?
__Leonard She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
__Priya Was she upset?
__Leonard Maybe, but that's not my problem. She's not my girlfriend, you are.
__Priya I hope you weren't cruel to her.
__Leonard Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature's way?
__Sheldon Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I think I figured out Wolowitz's magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.
__Leonard I am not opening that door, Sheldon.
__Sheldon As you wish.  Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed.  Did you pick one?
__Leonard Yep.
__Sheldon Is this your card?
__Sheldon Drat. Is this your card?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon I'll be right back.
__Sheldon I'm reverse engineering Wolowitz's magic trick.
__Leonard What's up with the infrared cameras?
__Sheldon I'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one's been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.
__Leonard Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?
__Sheldon Yes. I'm using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
__Leonard Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.
__Sheldon Relax, we're not under attack right now.
__Leonard Okay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.
__Sheldon And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.
__Priya It's okay, I like Indian food.
__Leonard Or as you probably call it back home, food.
__Leonard No, no, I do. It's just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.
__Priya You know, my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.
__Leonard Does that mean you'd relocate here permanently?
__Priya Maybe. What do you think?
__Leonard Oh,  I love it. Oh, that's great!
__Penny Hi! Hi! Just hang on.
__Leonard Small world.
__Priya You did talk to her, didn't you?
__Leonard Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.
__Penny Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn't look like a mannequin in the boys' department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?
__Priya No, he did not.
__Penny He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That's our Lenny, huh?
__Priya Yes, that's our Lenny.
__Penny So, how's the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I'm sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.
__Leonard Bye.
__Priya Good night.
__Penny Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.
__Leonard It is pretty spicy.
__Howard Really?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.
__Howard I'd love to see that. How about you, Raj?
__Raj Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
__Sheldon All right. Pick a card.
__Howard Okay.
__Sheldon Bippity-boppity-boo.
__Howard What's with the wand and the beep?
__Sheldon The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I'm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning's ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.
__Raj These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It's transmitting to your phone.
__Sheldon I said, ta-da. Show's over.
__Howard That's pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don't let me see it.
__Raj Son of a gun, you're blowing my mind!
__Howard Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!
__Sheldon That does it. I'm getting uranium.
__Raj You ever gonna tell him?
__Howard Maybe. When it stops being fun.
__Raj So never.
__Leonard Oh, okay, it's not important. It can wait.
__Penny No, it's all right. Walk me down. So, what's up?
__Leonard Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.
__Penny Sure, anything.
__Leonard Move out.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools.
__Penny Okay, I'm not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?
__Leonard Why does it have to be about anything? Can't a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?
__Penny Oh, for god's sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn't it? She doesn't want me hanging out with you.
__Leonard Yes. There, I said it.
__Penny Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.
__Leonard And she likes you.
__Penny No, she doesn't.
__Leonard Not really, no.
__Penny It doesn't matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.
__Leonard Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.
__Penny You can hear my toilet flush?
__Penny Leonard, I get it. You're in a new relationship now. And I'm happy for you. So why don't we just shake hands and part friends?
__Leonard Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?
__Penny Are you really that kind of guy?
__Leonard No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
__Penny Good-bye, Leonard.
__Leonard Penny, wait.  Damned contacts.
__Raj Hi!
__Howard Hey!
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj Why so glum, chum?
__Sheldon Apparently, you can't hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.
__Howard Oh, that's too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?
__Sheldon Figure out the magic trick yet?
__Howard Want me to tell you how to do it?
__Sheldon No.
__Howard I'll show you one more time. Raj?
__Sheldon Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there's no monkey business.
__Howard All right. (Raj looks over Sheldon's shoulder. Holds two fingers over his heart). Two of hearts.
__Howard Yeah, he's gonna win the Nobel prize.
__Policeman Here. Breathe into this bag.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Sheldon They stole everything, Leonard, everything.
__Policeman Are you the roommate?
__Leonard Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?
__Policeman Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.
__Leonard Oh, my God, what did they get?
__Sheldon What didn't they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.
__Leonard You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
__Sheldon What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.
__Policeman Into the bag.
__Sheldon They took my battle ostrich.
__Leonard Oh, no, not Glenn?
__Sheldon Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.
__Policeman Good luck, fellas.
__Sheldon Wait a minute! You're not going to do anything?
__Policeman Mr. Cooper, there's nothing…
__Sheldon Doctor Cooper.
__Policeman Seriously?
__Leonard Not the kind with access to drugs.
__Policeman Fine. Dr. Cooper. I'm sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.
__Sheldon That's from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?
__Policeman What?
__Sheldon You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?
__Policeman No.
__Leonard Thank you, officer.
__Sheldon It's all gone. All gone.
__Leonard I'm really sorry, Sheldon.
__Sheldon What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man's battle ostrich?
__Leonard I don't know.
__Sheldon This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.
__Leonard I'm on it.  Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.
__Sheldon See if Raj is done with Pilates.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn't leave a digital fingerprint.
__Sheldon Oh! There isn't enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
__Raj Hold on. I'm talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he'll help us track down your things.
__Sheldon Can we trust him?
__Raj I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.
__Howard Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
__Sheldon No. Glenn's was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.
__Penny Hey.
__Leonard Hey, Penny. We're kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.
__Penny Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.
__Sheldon That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it's a game.
__Raj Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.
__Penny Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!
__Sheldon Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
__Penny Just say thank you.
__Sheldon I thought I just did.
__Penny All right. See you later.
__Priya Oh! Hello.
__Penny Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that's useful in a make-believe place.
__Priya I don't know what that means.
__Penny Yeah, well, sadly, I do.
__Bernadette I feel like I'm supposed to say that bitch, but I don't have enough information.
__Penny I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.
__Bernadette I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.
__Penny So what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
__Amy I think you're on.
__Bernadette Oh. That bitch!
__Penny Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
__Amy Ah, here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.
__Penny You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.
__Amy I'm drunk.
__Penny You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.
__Bernadette Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm never speaking to Priya again.
__Penny No, don't do that. No reason to be mean to her.
__Amy This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?
__Penny No, but I can name all the Kardashians.
__Amy Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette's urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.
__Bernadette I don't have an urge to fling my waste.
__Amy Believe me, it's there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I'll show you.
__Raj I don't think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone's undressing her with their eyes.
__Howard Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
__Leonard Okay, what exactly are we looking for?
__Howard Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it's after school hours, he's your guy.
__Priya Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.
__Leonard Uh, we are. In the meantime, you're welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.
__Priya Seriously?
__Leonard Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it's fun.
__Priya Maybe I should just go home.
__Howard Our troll just walked in! I got him!
__Leonard We got him. We're almost done.
__Sheldon Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn't start talking, we'll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.
__Raj Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.
__Sheldon I don't care! I'm losin' it, man!
__Leonard Why don't we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.
__Priya Oh, dear Lord.
__Howard Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.
__Raj Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I'll have sex with him.
__Leonard That's not where it was going.
__Raj Good, because I would hate that.
__Priya Leonard, you're busy, let's talk tomorrow.
__Leonard Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?
__Priya No, no, I think it's sexy to date a boy trapped in a man's body.
__Leonard Good, good. I'll tell you what happens.
__Sheldon And people think I don't get sarcasm.
__Penny Okay, be nice.
__Priya Hello.
__Penny Hi. We're just heading out for a drink.
__Amy Because I do that now.
__Bernadette Count your blessings you're not a Tanzanian chimp.
__Priya What?
__Penny Don't listen to her, she's had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?
__Priya Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.
__Amy Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?
__Raj Oh, no, don't put me in the middle of this. I'm not going to be your go-between.
__Leonard Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?
__Raj There's no reason to worry.
__Leonard That's a relief.
__Raj I'm sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.
__Howard Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.
__Sheldon What?
__Leonard Really?
__Howard Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.
__Sheldon I've never said these words before, but good job, Howard!
__Howard Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.
__Sheldon The name and the address drip with evil.
__Raj What else do we know about him?
__Howard Well, quite a bit, actually.
__Leonard I'll bet he's some loser who lives with his parents.
__Howard Yes, he does live with his parents. Here's a Google Earth shot of their house.
__Sheldon Excellent! It's in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
__Leonard Hold on, you're thinking of going there?
__Sheldon Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
__Leonard Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?
__Sheldon I don't know if you've been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.
__Leonard No one's getting tortured.
__Sheldon Fine, we'll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?
__Raj I totally had one of those.
__Sheldon Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who's with me?
__Raj I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?
__Sheldon Sure.
__Howard Also, tonight's the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and
__ watching Wheel of Fortune, so If we could leave at eight, we'd still be able to regain our birthright at ten, ten thirty latest.
__ Fine. Leonard?
__Leonard Oh, geez, I don't know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.
__Raj Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister.
__Leonard Aw, screw it. I'm in.
__Raj Me, too.
__Sheldon One moment.  I'm hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.
__Howard I am. She's just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N's, one V.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Fanny pack of wolves.
__Leonard That's incredible.
__Howard Yeah, she's kind of a Wheel savant.
__Leonard Uh-oh, that's Priya.
__Raj Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.
__Leonard Hit the… Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I'll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.
__Raj Very nice. You lie to my sister.
__Howard That's the nicest thing he does to your sister.
__Leonard Cover for me.
__Raj Hello, Priya. What's up? How would I know if Leonard's at work or not? Don't be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you're going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.
__Howard New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D's, three O's.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!
__Sheldon That's uncanny.
__Howard I know. It's her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.
__Howard Yeah, we're kind of bad-asses, aren't we?
__Leonard Totally.
__Sheldon Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let's stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.
__Raj Yeah, we're coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.
__Sheldon I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?
__Raj I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
__Raj It's a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
__Howard Beyonce? Really?
__Raj She's curvy and she owns it. I like that.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.
__Sheldon We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
__Sheldon I always prefer the train.
__Sheldon Coming.
__Howard Why did you bring that?
__Sheldon No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart than a Klingon bat'leth.
__Leonard Okay, let's get clear on something. We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one's bat'lething anybody.
__Sheldon So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Well, now I just feel silly holding it.
__Leonard Come on.
__Sheldon Can I at least kick down the door?
__Leonard You're welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box.
__Voice Inside Who is it?
__Sheldon Your doom!
__Raj Don't say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
__Sheldon Good point. Basket of puppies.
__Huge man What?
__Leonard Uh, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Are you Todd Zarnecki?
__Todd Yeah. Who are you?
__Sheldon I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.
__Todd I don't think so. Let me see that.
__Sheldon Careful. That's a collectible.
__Todd I know. I've always wanted one.
__Sheldon Well, he's even more cunning than we thought.
__Howard Yeah, he walked right into our trap.
__Raj Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
__Leonard Oh-oh.
__Raj What's the matter?
__Leonard Something's wrong, I'm not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?
__Sheldon Of course.
__Raj Very basic.
__Howard 19th-century technology.
__Leonard Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
__Sheldon No.
__Howard No, not a clue.
__Leonard Well, we'd better call somebody to come pick us up.
__Sheldon It'd be swell if they had a train.
__Penny No problem. So, Leonard, I think it's interesting you didn't call your girlfriend to come get you.
__Leonard Uh, I kind of told her I was working.
__Penny So you lied to her. Also interesting.
__Leonard Yeah, she doesn't really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.
__Penny Well, doesn't matter if she gets it, as long as she's pretty.
__Howard This one's funny, Leonard. How come you couldn't make it work with her?
__Penny So did you at least get Sheldon's fake stuff back?
__Sheldon No. We failed in our noble quest.
__Penny How come?
__Sheldon Todd Zarnecki was mean.
__Penny All right. Hang on.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Penny I'm gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce.  This ain't no Beyonce.
__Penny Give my friend his stuff back.
__Todd I don't know what you're talking about.
__Penny Well, then, good news. Today's the day a girl's finally going to touch you in your little special place.  Now give him his stuff back.
__Todd Okay.
__Sheldon We did it! I said, we.
__Penny Oh, hi.
__Priya Hi.
__Penny Going to see Leonard?
__Priya Yes. How have you been?
__Penny Fine. You?
__Priya Very well, thank you.
__ Alright, well great seeing you.
__Priya Yeah, you too.
__Penny Amy's right. I do want to fling my poop at her.
__Sheldon Hysterical.
__Amy I'm glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it's nice to goof off and do something silly.
__Sheldon Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you're in a comedy club.
__Greene You can think about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can't order the corresponding dish in column B. That's sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.
__Sheldon Ba-dum-bump.
__Amy Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.
__Sheldon Really, Amy? Gossip? I'm disappointed in you.
__Amy Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.
__Sheldon Forgive my language, but poppycock.
__Amy What if he's right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?
__Sheldon Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what's the 4-1-1?
__Amy Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
__Sheldon I believe our nation's tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?
__Greene Yes?
__Sheldon You've dedicated your life's work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
__Greene Yes, in part.
__Sheldon Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?
__Greene Excuse me?
__Sheldon Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.
__ Credits sequence
__Sheldon Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It's odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
__Leonard Perfect.
__Sheldon I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you're doing?
__Leonard Shooting at a target?
__Sheldon With what?
__Leonard An arrow.
__Sheldon Really? I didn't see you draw one from your quiver.
__Leonard I'm not going to do that, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too.  That was uncalled for, but I'll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.
__Leonard Really? How could you tell?
__Sheldon She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
__Leonard You don't say?
__Sheldon Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
__Leonard So, what's the gossip?
__Sheldon Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.
__Leonard Fine, don't tell me.
__Sheldon All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
__Leonard Oh. That's too bad. I wonder what happened.
__Sheldon Mm, it's hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents' marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.
__Leonard Boy, you sure get your money's worth out of these games.
__Priya Sure.
__Leonard Oh, God.
__Priya What?
__Leonard It's okay. You didn't know. I'll take care of it.
__Priya What, what did I do?
__Leonard Sheldon doesn't allow flossing that close to the mirror.
__Priya You're kidding.
__Leonard It's a splatter thing. There's a little piece of tape on the floor you're supposed to stand behind.
__Priya That's madness.
__Leonard I know. Just do it. There's a big inspection coming up, and I don't want to lose my TV privileges.
__Priya You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.
__Leonard Mm, I don't know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it's just easier to stand behind the tape.
__Priya Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?
__Priya You'll need to explain the game to me.
__Leonard Mm, it's complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.
__Priya Well, regardless, I've got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She's really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.
__Leonard Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.
__Priya Why not?
__Leonard Don't tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.
__Priya Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that's good news.
__Priya My brother. He's got a big crush on Bernadette.
__Leonard What? You're kidding!
__Priya Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
__Priya Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What's that piece of tape?
__Leonard Oh, that one doesn't apply to you. You sit.
__Penny Hey! How's it going?
__Leonard Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
__Penny ‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
__Leonard I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
__Penny Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I'm sure Bernadette can do better.
__Leonard Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
__Penny You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
__Leonard I didn't say Raj. Who said Raj?
__Penny Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?
__Leonard No.
__Penny Well, then who?
__Leonard I can't say.
__Penny Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.
__Leonard Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj's friendship.
__Penny You don't have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.
__Leonard You're the one who told Amy in the first place.
__Penny In confidence!
__Mrs Koothrappali We're very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can't complain.
__Dr Koothrappali So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?
__Priya It's fine. But if I'm going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place.
__Mrs Koothrappali Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren't you making your sister comfortable?
__Raj I am making her comfortable. Besides, she's not sleeping here half the time anyway.
__Dr Koothrappali What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?
__Priya It's a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late.
__Mrs Koothrappali Please tell me you're not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?
__Dr Koothrappali Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that's not a bad way to go. He's Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don't drink a lot.
__Raj It, it doesn't matter. Howard has a girlfriend.
__Priya For now.
__Raj What does that mean?
__Priya I'll tell you later.
__Raj Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
__Mrs Koothrappali Who's Bernadette?
__Dr Koothrappali Doesn't sound Jewish.
__Mrs Koothrappali You can't tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.
__Dr Koothrappali Okay, we're getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.
__Priya Thank you, Daddy.
__Raj Don't worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon…
__Priya Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.
__Raj Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!
__Priya Well you should have kept your mouth shut.
__Leonard Oh, yeah? What about it?
__Sheldon That's all. I've just been thinking about it. Now, I'm thinking about fractal equations. Now I'm thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I'm thinking about trains.
__Raj Are you listening to this guy?
__Howard Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry. I was somewhere else.
__Leonard Lucky bastard.
__Sheldon Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.
__Raj So what's up?
__Howard It's a Bernadette thing.
__Raj Oh, no. I hope everything's okay.
__Leonard Whatever it is, we're here for you. You can tell us anything.
__Raj Yeah. Good or devastating.
__Howard I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
__Leonard Marry you?
__Raj What?
__Howard Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
__Leonard Oh, I'd wait.
__Raj No rush, no rush.
__Howard Oh, great. It's my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what'd you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat's fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It's one of the reasons I love her.
__Leonard Man, he's going to be blindsided.
__Raj I know. It'll be awful.
__Sheldon Why are you smiling?
__Leonard Yeah, Raj, why?
__Raj Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India's a goofy place.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm back to trains. Woo-woo.
__Sheldon No.
__Amy Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
__Sheldon Have you learned anything?
__Amy Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it's not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
__Sheldon Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
__Amy I don't understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
__Sheldon I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.
__Amy It's not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?
__Sheldon I'm familiar with everything, but go on.
__Amy Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
__Sheldon I'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.
__Sheldon Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
__Sheldon It's one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don't find repellent.
__Amy We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
__Sheldon And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
__Amy Then we'll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.
__Sheldon Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Amy Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I'm thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.
__Raj I just felt like drinking alone, because I'm deep and dark.
__Bernadette Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard's not here?
__Raj No. It's just one of those times when it's just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Raj Me, too. Good times.
__Penny Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.
__Bernadette Oh, thanks.
__Raj This was nice.
__Penny What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.
__Raj I was when I came in, but it's amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.
__Penny Well, I know that. How do you know that?
__Raj My sister told me.
__Penny Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.
__Raj None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
__Penny Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.
__Raj What can I do? I can't stop thinking about her.
__Penny All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.
__Raj Shut your ass!
__Penny Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.
__Raj How did that even happen? Did they know that's what they were doing when they were doing it?
__Penny I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
__Raj Wow. I can't believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
__Leonard Hope you're hungry.
__Sheldon Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It's a lesson in context.
__Leonard Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
__Sheldon Yes, I believe so.
__Leonard Good, good. Everything okay between you two?
__Sheldon Yes. Why do you ask?
__Leonard No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.
__Sheldon Did he mean as if she'd been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?
__Leonard No. That's not what he meant.
__Sheldon Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
__Leonard Yeah, you do. You dog, you.
__Sheldon Did you get that?
__Amy Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
__Sheldon This is moving faster than we thought.
__Amy Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
__Sheldon I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.
__Amy Slow down, Sheldon. I'm not quite there yet.
__Howard Sure.
__Amy Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
__Sheldon Pun intended?
__Amy No. Happy accident.
__Sheldon This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
__Amy I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
__Sheldon Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.
__Amy Pun intended?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. What pun?
__Amy Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.
__Sheldon I wish you hadn't done that. That's going to make me a chick magnet, and I'm so busy as it is.
__Howard Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can't think of a better time than when I'm with all my friends.
__Leonard Oh, hold on, Howard. There's lots of better times.
__Raj Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.
__Howard Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski…
__Bernadette Oh, God. What's happening?
__Howard I know things haven't been perfect with us, and we've had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…
__Bernadette Howard, let me just stop you right here.
__Bernadette Yes.
__Howard Yes, what?
__Bernadette Yes, I will marry you.
__Howard You will?
__Raj You will?
__Bernadette I will. I will!
__Howard Oh, I love you so much.
__Bernadette Oh, I love you, too.
__Leonard Congratulations!
__Priya Oh, it's so exciting.
__Amy I wonder what changed her mind.
__Sheldon Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
__Amy As good an explanation as any.
__Leonard That's great.
__Amy Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I'm getting orthotics. Also, I'm carrying Sheldon's baby. Mum's the word.
__Leonard I can't hear you, I'm in the shower.
__Sheldon I asked if you were in the shower, but that's moot now.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
__Leonard I can't hear you, I'm in the shower.
__Sheldon I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
__Leonard What kind of emergency?
__Sheldon Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.
__Leonard You might not want to do that.
__Sheldon I assure you I do.
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.
__Sheldon What?
__Priya Hello, Sheldon.
__Sheldon What are you doing in there? She can't be in here.
__Leonard We were in here first, you can't be in here.
__Sheldon According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.
__Sheldon Come on, you can't wait two minutes?
__Priya Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Move. Move. Move!
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Yeah, fine.
__Priya Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.
__Leonard Oh. Cool. I've got a lawyer. And I've seen her naked.
__Priya Proceed.
__Sheldon Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.
__Priya Can I see the roommate agreement?
__Sheldon Um, it's fairly technical.
__Priya I think I can handle it.
__Leonard Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.
__Priya All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn't look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Do so, do so.
__Priya Oh, I'm afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.
__Sheldon Oh, that's ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.
__Priya Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?
__Sheldon Irrelevant. Leonard doesn't trim his nose hair. He thinks because he's short nobody can see up there.
__Priya My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.
__Sheldon But…
__Priya There's no buts, Sheldon, that's how the law works.
__Leonard Schooled!
__Priya As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.
__Leonard Superceded!
__Sheldon This isn't over.
__Leonard No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that's happened today.
__Priya Seriously?
__Howard I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy's Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
__Sheldon What is that you're eating? Tonight is pizza night.
__Leonard I'd like to refer that to my attorney.
__Priya According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi's pizza night.
__Sheldon Yes, and when Franconi's went out of business, we switched to Graziano's.
__Howard That's interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?
__Priya A good question, Howard. Turns out you can't. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?
__Sheldon No.
__All Opa!
__Sheldon This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.
__Leonard Not as much as you.
__Sheldon Fine. I'm nothing if not adaptable.
__Leonard I got you the lamb kabob.
__Sheldon Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn't that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.
__Penny Hey. What's up?
__Sheldon The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
__Penny Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I'm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you're welcome to tag along.
__Sheldon A girls night? Oh, I don't know if I'm up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.
__Penny Okay, suit yourself. We'll probably be trashing Priya a little.
__Sheldon Shotgun.
__Amy Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.
__Bernadette Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
__Sheldon Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?
__Amy Why did you bring him? He's harshing my buzz.
__Penny I felt sorry for him. Priya's giving him a hard time.
__Bernadette Ooh, the Priya bashing's starting early. Yay! Okay, what's up with those pantsuits?
__Amy I need some context.
__Penny Pantsuits suck.
__Amy And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.
__Sheldon It's talc. But as that's a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.
__Amy Oh, I'm not confused at all. You're like a sexy toddler.
__Sheldon I don't know how to process that.
__Bernadette I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
__Bernadette Not if they're doing it for a long time.
__Penny Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?
__Sheldon Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X's and O's.
__Bernadette That doesn't count. Aren't you even a little curious?
__Penny Yeah, you're a scientist, where is the curiosity?
__Amy I'm available for experimentation.
__Sheldon Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
__Amy Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie
__Sheldon I'm certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
__Penny Hey, I know, let's take Sheldon dancing.
__Bernadette Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.
__Sheldon No, thank you, but for the record, I'm an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.
__Amy Really?
__Sheldon I don't see why that's surprising. I excel at so many things. You've had my sourdough bread.
__Penny Did you take dance lessons?
__Sheldon Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.
__Penny Oh, we are so taking you dancing.
__Sheldon No, you most certainly are not.
__Bernadette Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?
__Sheldon I saved a nun's life. Why am I being punished?
__Taxi driver Where you can what?
__Sheldon Waltz. It's a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. (Sings Blue Danube. The taxi driver says something into radio in Korean. The word “waltz” is included. Dispatcher replies also in Korean. Taxi driver sings Blue Danube. Dispatcher says “oh, waltz!” They speak Korean some more. )
__Taxi Driver Here we go.
__Amy I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
__Sheldon What happened to you?
__Bernadette Muy caliente, Sheldon!
__Elderly Korean Gentleman Care to dance?
__Bernadette Oh, I'm sorry, I'm engaged.
__Korean How about you?
__Penny Oh, what the hell. Ooh!
__Sheldon What's 16 times 14?
__Amy My burps taste like cranberry juice.
__Sheldon And there's your answer.
__Amy Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
__Sheldon If you're referring to the beverage, you know I don't drink. If you're referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.
__Amy I have yoo-hoo.
__Sheldon It's hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
__Amy Make yourself comfortable.
__Sheldon Thank you. Is someone smoking?
__Amy Oh, that's just Ricky.
__Sheldon You own a smoking monkey?
__Amy Don't be silly. He's one of the animals in my department's nicotine addiction study.
__Sheldon What's he doing here?
__Amy I'm giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
__Sheldon Remarkable. Aren't you worried about secondhand smoke?
__Amy A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I'm sleeping.
__Sheldon is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
__Amy Yeah. He's kind of an ass.
__Sheldon Thank you. May I share something with you that's troubling me?
__Amy Of course. What's rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
__Sheldon Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.
__Amy And you want me to kill her? Done.
__Sheldon No, of course not.
__Amy I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us 'cause people love monkeys.
__Amy Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
__Sheldon No.
__Amy What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
__Sheldon Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That's a little outside my comfort zone.
__Amy You're being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.
__Sheldon Are you suggesting I play dirty?
__Amy Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business.
__Sheldon Fascinating.
__Amy I hope you don't take what I'm about to do as a comment on what we just did.
__Sheldon Who's to say you shouldn't be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.
__Sheldon Oh, good, you're up. I've written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I'd like you to sign it.
__Leonard Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
__Sheldon Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.
__Female Voice Self-destruct sequence activated.
__Leonard What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?
__Sheldon That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.
__Priya So what happens when it counts down?
__Sheldon Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you're in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.
__Priya Oh, my God.
__Leonard What's the big deal?
__Priya Trust me, it's a big deal.
__Leonard They're gonna find out about me eventually, right?
__Priya Yeah, of course, just not today.
__Sheldon 20 seconds.
__Leonard Are you ashamed of me?
__Priya Of course not.
__Leonard Then why can't we tell your parents?
__Priya Please, don't push this.
__Sheldon He does that all the time, doesn't he? 15.
__Priya Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.
__Leonard No, he's bluffing.
__Sheldon I never bluff. Ten.
__Leonard It's blackmail!
__Sheldon Nine.
__Priya We give up.
__Sheldon Eight.
__Leonard This is ridiculous.
__Sheldon It's a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?
__Priya Give him what he wants or we're done.
__Sheldon Three.
__Leonard Really?
__Sheldon Two.
__Leonard Okay, I'll sign it!
__Female Voice Self-destruct sequence aborted.
__Sheldon You may have gone to Cambridge, but I'm an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy.
__Amy It most assuredly is not.
__Sheldon Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?
__Amy Yes. I also found a Korean man's business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?
__Sheldon Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.
__Amy Sheldon?
__Sheldon All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left.
__Amy Okay. Don't really know where we go from here.
__Sheldon I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.
__Amy Terrific. Thank you.  They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.
__Leonard Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!
__Sheldon You're preaching to the choir, sister.
__Penny Glad you're enjoying yourself.
__Amy Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.
__Bernadette Amy, you must've been in the bathroom with other women before.
__Amy Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
__Bernadette Some women don't like to get chummy when their panties are down.
__Amy You okay in there, bestie?
__Penny I'm fine.
__Amy The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine
__Amy She always this crabby when she urinates?
__Bernadette We're really not that close.
__Penny Screw it. I'll go later.
__Amy And I'll be right by your side.
__Penny Oh, that's nice.
__Amy No, it's not. It's a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.
__Bernadette You think?
__Amy Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.
__Bernadette Well, what makes me the weakest member?
__Amy Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.
__Penny Okay, Amy, you're being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
__Bernadette It doesn't matter. I'm going to tell her we can't make it.
__Amy Oh, no. You have to go.
__Bernadette I don't understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
__Amy You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we're going to use that to our advantage.
__Penny Wait. What are you talking about?
__Amy By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya's tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights.
__Bernadette I don't know. I'm not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
__Penny Okay, I don't know you people. I'm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.
__Amy How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
__Bernadette I don't want anything in my ample bosom.
__Amy Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.
__ Credits sequence
__ Okay, see you later.
__Sheldon Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
__Leonard That is good news. Bye.
__Sheldon Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
__Leonard That, that's brilliant.
__Leonard Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?
__Sheldon When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.
__Leonard All right.
__Sheldon Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.
__Leonard Elegant.
__Sheldon That's because it's simple.
__Leonard Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.
__Sheldon And…
__Sheldon And a third person. It's three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.
__Leonard Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.
__Sheldon Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn't been such a hound dog, we'd all have time machines.
__Leonard Got it. Bye.
__Leonard I think he's getting worse.
__Leonard You okay?
__Amy Yeah, yeah. I'm just breaking in some new shoes.
__Leonard Very pretty.
__Amy Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
__Leonard Hadn't really thought about it.
__Amy Look.
__Leonard Uh, sure. Very… prominent.
__Amy Please, Leonard, don't leer, you have a girlfriend.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Amy So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?
__Leonard Yeah. How did you know?
__Amy I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, 'cause, you know, that's kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.
__Leonard Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?
__Raj The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I'd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
__Priya Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?
__Raj I have to feel sorry for myself. I'm the only one who cares. Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.
__Leonard Really? In front of your sister?
__Priya We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.
__Raj Excuse me. I'm going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  I forgot my windbreaker. It's chilly.
__Penny No. Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.
__Amy the wildebeest is in the curry.
__Penny The what?
__Amy Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya.”
__Penny Hey. Seriously? Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
__Amy I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn't have any.
__Penny None?
__Amy I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It's the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
__Amy She thinks it's cool you're following your dream, no matter what.
__Penny That bitch!
__Amy How do you want to handle it?
__Penny Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
__Amy Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?
__Penny What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.
__Amy I'm gonna say 3-D. That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.
__Bernadette That's what I hear.
__Howard Then the studio must have real faith in it.
__Leonard Wonder why she didn't tell me.
__Priya Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
__Leonard No.
__Leonard Well, it's not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.
__Priya What other thing?
__Leonard Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don't, oh, what's the word I'm looking for?
__Howard I'm not going to help you. This is hilarious.
__Bernadette She's also dating an astronaut.
__Priya Wow. That's very impressive.
__Bernadette Yeah. But Leonard's impressive, too.
__Leonard Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
__Raj I need a hug.
__Sheldon Sorry, I have company.
__Raj Come on, Sheldon, open the door.
__Sheldon I don't want to hug you.
__Raj I don't want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.
__Sheldon Blue, as in depressed.
__Raj Well, not so much depressed as lonely.
__Sheldon I don't know what colour lonely is.
__Raj What?
__Sheldon Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.
__Raj Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.
__Sheldon All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don't see that catching on at all.
__Raj What are you doing?
__Sheldon I'm working on my three-person chess game.
__Raj Oh, cool. Can I play?
__Sheldon It's three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can't play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.
__Raj No, thank you. I'm fine.
__Sheldon It's not optional. We're out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
__Raj I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering what's got me down.
__Sheldon Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?
__Raj I'm going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.
__Sheldon The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance he'll kill himself.
__Raj Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared.
__Sheldon Yellow. Go ahead.
__Raj A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing. He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
__Sheldon Fascinating. What's in it?
__Raj I'm not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
__Sheldon I like cows.
__Raj That's not the point.
__Sheldon It was its own point. Go on.
__Raj I'm a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.
__Sheldon Rajesh, I've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.
__Bernadette I don't know. The regular way people meet astronauts.
__Howard Most of those guys live in Texas.
__Bernadette Obviously, this one doesn't.
__Howard Okay.
__Bernadette Leonard lives here. Priya's from India. People meet, Howard. God!
__Howard Fine.
__Bernadette You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never grilled you about that. I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
__Howard I'm not grilling you, I was just curious.
__Leonard I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't.
__Bernadette Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?
__Priya I'm sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
__Bernadette He's a consultant.
__Leonard I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
__Bernadette He can't have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?
__Howard It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?
__ us away, we love you.” I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent. “But, Penny, you look so good in us.” Damn it, the shoes are right.
__ Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.  What do you got for me, wildebeest?
__Bernadette Bernadette (in Raj's bathroom): I think they're on to me. The story's starting to fall apart.
__Amy Calm down. Everything's going to be okay.  We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?
__Amy Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What's the problem?
__Bernadette They're just asking me all sorts of questions I can't answer.
__Amy Just change the subject.
__Bernadette I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya's parents.
__Penny What?
__Bernadette They said something about going there this summer.
__Penny What, are they getting engaged?
__Bernadette I don't know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy's stupid astronaut story!
__Amy What astronaut story?
__Bernadette You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.
__Amy I texted architect. That's amusing. Auto-correct must've changed it.
__Bernadette Yeah, it's hysterical.
__Penny All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.
__Amy Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?
__Penny Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India.
__Bernadette I don't want to do this anymore!
__Penny Don't you quit on us!
__Howard Bernie, you okay?
__Sheldon I'm glad you think so. That's what I strive to emulate.
__Raj Okay, let's see if this drug works.
__Woman at table Can I help you?
__Raj Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful.
__Woman Thank you. That's a great accent. Where are you from?
__Raj India.
__Woman Oh, cool. I've always wanted to go there.
__Raj It's a beautiful country. You'd love it. May I join you?
__Woman Uh, okay, sure. Why not?
__Raj My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
__Woman Hi.
__Sheldon Oh, there's no need to interact with me. I'm just here to observe.
__Woman What's he observing?
__Raj We're scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.
__Sheldon All right.
__Raj And what is your name?
__Woman Angela.
__Raj Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.
__Angela You're cute.
__Sheldon I'd like to buy a scone.
__Server Oh, I'm sorry, we're out. We have muffins.
__Sheldon They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.
__Angela What are you doing?
__Raj Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
__Angela I…
__Sheldon They were out of scones.
__Raj Sheldon, I'm talking to someone. You're being rude. I'll bet you're an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.
__Angela Oh, my God.
__Raj Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!
__Leonard Thanks, yeah.
__Howard Sure.
__Bernadette Let me help you.
__Leonard Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?
__Bernadette This trip to India sounds fun.
__Priya Yeah, I think it will be.
__Bernadette Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
__Priya A little. They're very old-fashioned.
__Bernadette Well, I wouldn't worry about it. It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?
__Priya Oh, God, no. We're not there yet.
__Bernadette Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
__Priya You've been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?
__Bernadette Yes. Are you writing a book?
__Priya Why are you getting upset?
__Bernadette I'm not upset. Maybe you're upset.
__Priya What's up with you? Bernadette?
__Bernadette I can't do this anymore! I'm a good girl! I went to Catholic school!
__Howard Okay, well, it's getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?
__Leonard I think the word you're looking for is befuddled.
__Howard Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard's Queen's Bishop
__ five-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.
__ Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
__Sheldon When it's done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
__Sheldon I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
__Raj Hey, I've got winners.
__Bernadette You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who's prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
__Penny Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.
__Bernadette Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
__Penny Oh, please, you're not that kind of person.
__Bernadette I know. But if she orders something low-fat I'll totally give her the full-fat version.
__Leonard Uh, that's my water.
__Sheldon What?
__Leonard My water. You're drinking it.
__Sheldon Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
__Leonard Yes. It's my water.
__Sheldon Well, that's it then. I'm dead.
__Leonard Here we go.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.
__Raj Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other.
__Bernadette You guys ready to order?
__Sheldon Yes, I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.
__Bernadette I don't understand.
__Howard He drank from Leonard's glass.
__Sheldon He drank from Leonard's glass. Words they'll be carving into my tombstone.
__Leonard That's actually my napkin.
__Howard Where are you going?
__Sheldon To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!
__ Credits sequence.
__Priya Is it diet?
__Bernadette That's what you ordered.
__Priya Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?
__Bernadette Yeah. We're thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
__Howard Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
__Leonard What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
__Bernadette He hasn't told her yet. He's waiting for the right time.
__Howard I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
__Priya Howard, you've got to tell your mother.
__Howard Hey, have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of skim milk here?
__Priya Uh, that's different. First of all, we're not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.
__Howard Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.
__Sheldon I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
__Leonard You all right?
__Sheldon Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
__Howard Troll master.
__Raj Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
__Leonard Water nymph.
__Raj Oh, yeah, she's got puddles in all the right places.
__Sheldon Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
__Raj Sorry. Walking tree.
__Sheldon Last one.
__Raj I'm taking a stroll and I'm sporting wood.
__Howard Okay, the Eagle has landed.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Howard Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.
__Raj Oh, that sounds lovely.
__Howard Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.
__Leonard Have you met Bernadette's parents?
__Howard You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.
__Raj Sheldon, that's my water.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord!
__Leonard That's not your water.
__Raj I know.
__Sheldon Where's the mouthwash?
__Raj Where indeed.
__Howard So, how'd it go?
__Mrs Wolowitz Too soon to say. I'm not done yet.
__Howard No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.
__Mrs Wolowitz Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that's what a person orders in a Jewish deli.
__Howard Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?
__Mrs Wolowitz Oh, sure. Did you know she's going to school to become a microbiologist?
__Howard No, she never mentioned it.
__Mrs Wolowitz I bet she did and you didn't listen.
__Howard Yeah, that's probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She's great, huh?
__Mrs Wolowitz She's a lovely girl. Cute as a button.
__Howard That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.
__Mrs Wolowitz I hope it's good news, because I've got nothing but disappointment in here!
__Howard Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma?  Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I'm gonna break the door down! (Runs at door. It doesn't break down. Falls over.) Son of a bitch! Ma, help!
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny Haven't seen you in a while. How's it going?
__Sheldon Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory.  Did I say something amusing?
__Penny I don't know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.
__Sheldon So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
__Penny My mirth. Classic.
__Sheldon Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
__Penny It's not a big deal, Sheldon. It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister, I've had to keep my distance. I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.
__Sheldon Jibber-jabber? I don't jibber-jabber.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.
__Penny Alright, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.
__Sheldon Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?
__Penny Oh, my God, you're about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.
__Leonard Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.
__Penny Oh, my God! What happened?
__Leonard I don't know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Sheldon, let's go!
__Sheldon To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don't think so.
__Sheldon I can't.
__Penny Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.
__Sheldon Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.
__Leonard Right, fine. I'll tell Howard you didn't come because you're more concerned about your own well-being than his.
__Sheldon I would think he would know that.
__Penny Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it's time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.
__Sheldon Fine, I'll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother's mantel.
__Bernadette You're a real hero, Howard.
__Howard No, I did what any son would do.
__Penny Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.
__Howard I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
__Penny Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.
__Howard What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.
__Leonard So, how is she?
__Howard They're running tests. I don't know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
__Penny What's the difference?
__Sheldon A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack.
__Penny Thanks for clearing that up.
__Sheldon Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What's more likely going to kill Howard's mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.
__Penny Okay, you're not helping.
__Sheldon Disagree.
__Leonard Go sit over there.
__Sheldon I'll sit over there, it looks cleaner.
__Leonard Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
__Howard My family is the history of heart disease. There's a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this
__Bernadette So it's probably genetic.
__Howard Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.
__Bernadette What?
__Howard It's not important.
__Bernadette Come on, Howard, I'm going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.
__Howard You'd think that. But no.
__Bernadette You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
__Howard You can't take that personally.
__Penny How else is she supposed to take it?
__Howard What you've got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I've been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she'd be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can't.
__Bernadette You mean sexual intercourse?
__Howard Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.
__Priya What happened?
__Bernadette Howard's mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can't.
__Howard Bernie, wait!
__Sheldon I'll give you $1,000 if you'll drive me home.
__Penny Well, he's my friend. It's what you do.
__Priya I'm sorry, did I miss something?
__Priya That's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.
__Penny Yeah, tell me about it.
__Priya You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.
__Penny You mean when he was little.
__Priya Not as little as you'd want him to be.
__Penny You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?
__Priya Sure. We're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?
__Leonard I'm fine. That's nice that they're getting along.
__Raj Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Raj One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
__Leonard I don't care. I don't have anything to hide.
__Raj Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.
__Leonard No, I do not. You are a mean little man.
__Howard Bernie, it's not you. She's just set in her ways.
__Bernadette How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
__Howard It's the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.
__Sheldon Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.
__Howard What's wrong with the bathroom here?
__Sheldon Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.
__Howard Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. I'm not taking you home.
__Sheldon Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?
__Howard No!
__Sheldon This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!
__Doctor Mr. Wolowitz?
__Howard Is she okay?
__Doctor It wasn't a heart attack. She's awake, she's resting comfortably. We're still running a few tests.
__Howard Can I see her?
__Doctor Actually, she said, and I quote, she'd like to see the little Catholic girl first.
__Bernadette Me? Why me?
__Howard Jews have been asking that for centuries. There's no real good answer.
__Bernadette Okay, well, wish me luck.
__Howard Don't worry, you'll be fine. Let's just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.
__Doctor You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?
__Howard Yeah.
__Doctor Why don't I write you a prescription for Xanax.
__Doctor Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.
__Sheldon No, I haven't. It's all good.
__Priya Oh, the poor thing.
__Penny It makes him desperate to please women. That's why the foreplay goes on and on.
__Priya It does, doesn't it?
__Penny It's like he's trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don't doze off. You will never hear the end of it.
__Sheldon Help me! Come back! Penny!
__Raj Like what?
__Leonard Every once in a while, before we'd go to bed, I'd put on a little show for her.
__Raj What do you mean, a show?
__Leonard Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.
__Raj Like, to music?
__Leonard I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.
__Raj So you'd do a striptease?
__Leonard I wasn't swinging around a pole.
__Raj Good, good.
__Leonard There was one time I put body glitter on.
__Raj Well, I don't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.
__Leonard No, she wouldn't.
__Raj Your big problem is me telling her.
__Leonard You really are a mean little man.
__Penny Yeah, I know, right?
__Leonard Hey, what took you guys so long?
__Priya Oh, we were just chatting.
__Leonard That's nice. What about?
__Penny We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
__Leonard That's funny.
__Penny Yeah.
__Raj What if she wasn't kidding?
__Leonard It doesn't matter. I'm the king of foreplay.
__Howard Hey, how'd it go?
__Bernadette You're a putz. You know what that means?
__Howard Yeah. Do you?
__Bernadette Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.
__Howard And are you?
__Bernadette No, because I'm engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.
__Howard Well, based on the available evid…
__Bernadette Shut up! She said I'm a wonderful girl and that you're lucky to have me.
__Howard Where are you going?
__Bermadette To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
__Howard Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she's angry?
__Raj He takes the elf from off the shelf.
__Leonard Hell Hounds.
__Raj Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
__Howard Colossal Serpent.
__Raj I got a colossal serpent right here.
__Sheldon Must you?
__Raj Sorry, I'm just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon's new Facebook photo.
__Sheldon Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.
__Howard If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.
__Howard Uh..
__Leonard Sure
__Penny Okay, Priya?
__Priya Uh, I'll have the Shepherd's Pie. You want to split that with me?
__Priya Why not?
__Leonard Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon.
__Sheldon Not quite accurate. The Macy's balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.
__Leonard So, no, on the Shepherd's Pie. Can we move on?
__Penny he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it.
__Leonard Sea bass. I'll have the sea bass.
__Howard You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.
__Leonard Kill me.
__Sheldon It wouldn'help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
__Bernadette Guys, sorry I'm late. I have amazing news.
__Sheldon Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard's faulty digestive system?
__Leonard So, what's your news, Bernadette?
__Bernadette The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I'm getting my PhD.
__Penny Oh!
__Sheldon Oh, congratulations.
__Penny Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.
__Howard Congratulations, honey.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__Leonard So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing that when you two get married, you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?
__Sheldon Unless he takes Bernadette's last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.
__Howard Please, this isn't about me. I'm proud of you.
__Bernadette Well, you'll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They're gonna pay me a buttload of money!
__Howard What?
__Howard Better than what you've got a buttload of.
__Leonard Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's peachy. If you do it, you're still not a doctor.
__Penny Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.
__ Credits sequence.
__Priya Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.
__Leonard You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.
__Priya Shh, my brother's going to hear you.
__Leonard Relax, he's got headphones on. And we're ten miles above Earth in a starship.
__Raj Really, ten miles? You're orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.
__Priya I can't believe I'm wearing my brother's Halloween costume.
__Leonard I can't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.
__Raj Okay, gotta go.
__Mrs Wolowitz Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?
__Howard No, Ma! It's Raj!
__Mrs Wolowitz He's a doctor too, right?
__Howard Yes!
__Mrs Wolowitz Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!
__Howard Sheldon, yes! Everybody's a doctor but me!
__Mrs Wolowitz Well, whose fault is that?
__Howard What's up?
__Raj Leonard's putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
__Howard Sure, but I'm going out with Bernadette. It'll just be you and my mother.
__Raj I guess that's okay.
__Howard Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!
__Mrs Wolowitz Of course, he and I can play doctor!
__Raj She's kidding, right?
__Howard I don't know, she's pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.
__Mrs Wolowitz Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!
__Amy It's indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.
__Sheldon Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
__Amy I'll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?
__Sheldon It's a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
__Amy Have you considered massage?
__Sheldon I'd like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
__Amy I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
__Sheldon Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
__Amy Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.
__Sheldon All right.
__Amy Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.
__Sheldon Rotating.
__Amy You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
__Sheldon You mean the myofascial point?
__Amy Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I've never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!
__Amy Don't flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
__Sheldon There's someone at my door.
__Amy That doesn't interest me. Goodbye.
__Raj Can I sleep here tonight?
__Sheldon Why?
__Raj Leonard's having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
__Sheldon I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
__Raj Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.
__Sheldon No, I can't authorize that.
__Raj Well, he's in my bed. Why can't I be in his?
__Sheldon The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.
__Raj Come on, dude, I'm exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.
__Raj Good night, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.
__Raj You're kidding.
__Sheldon I never kid about safety.
__Raj I was sleeping.
__Leonard In my bed?
__Raj Well, I would've slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.
__Leonard Oh, you heard?
__Raj Scotty, I need more power.
__Leonard Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?
__Raj Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?
__Raj Oh, my God, she's that Mona? Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?
__Leonard We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.
__Leonard Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment.
__Raj Can I bring girls here?
__Leonard You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
__Raj Okay, deal.
__Leonard Just not against their will.
__Howard Why?
__Leonard If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.
__Raj He's right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.
__Howard Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I'm not threatened by my fiancée's success. I'm proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.
__Leonard Until you have kids.
__Sheldon Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You're okay to stay for a while.
__Sheldon Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I'd follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.
__Raj What the hell is this?
__Sheldon Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
__Raj This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
__Sheldon As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that. Please sign.
__Raj Did you sign this?
__Leonard There's a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.
__Raj Well, that seems fair.
__Sheldon Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here's your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.
__Leonard Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.
__Sheldon Also, you're tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You'll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here's the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.
__Leonard No backsies.
__Sheldon What is this?
__Raj This is the difference between eating and dining.
__Sheldon Remarkable. I'm just realizing how much Leonard's been skating by all these years.
__Raj It's not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?
__Sheldon Yes, it's “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
__Penny Thanks. Wow! What's with the fancy spread?
__Sheldon My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh, nice touch, by the way.
__Penny What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
__Sheldon The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
__Raj I'm the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
__Penny All right, let me try this again. Where's Leonard?
__Raj He's living at my place, so I'm living here.
__Sheldon You're living here provisionally. But I must say it's looking good.
__Penny Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That's big.
__Sheldon No. Origami napkin swans, that's the headline.
__Raj It's a good thing.
__Bernadette Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it's not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.
__Howard Oh, Bernie, no. You didn't have to.
__Bernadette I wanted to. Come on, open it.
__Howard You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?
__Bernadette Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.
__Penny Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.
__Sheldon Here's an interesting fact about alcohol.
__Penny Hit me.
__Sheldon Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.
__Penny Monkeys.
__Sheldon When does a monkey have a trunk?
__Penny When a suitcase just won't do.
__Sheldon Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.
__Penny Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I've got to get me some of that?
__Raj Well, it's a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.
__Penny What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard's a noisy little dude in the sack.
__Raj Every night.
__Penny Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?
__Raj It's my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
__Penny Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?
__Raj Yeah.
__Penny I screwed up. Leonard's a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
__Raj Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It's better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.
__Penny Oh, you poor baby.
__Raj What's wrong with me, Penny?
__Penny Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren't friends, and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story, I'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.
__Raj Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.
__Raj To friendship.
__Sheldon Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!
__Priya Leonard, sweetheart, we're kissing, not eating hot soup.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Priya That's my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.
__Leonard Oh, come on! Why don't we just tell them that we're dating?
__Priya Oh, we've been through this. It's not the time.
__Leonard When is the time?
__Priya I've got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I'll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.
__Leonard Fine.
__Priya Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
__Dr Koothrappali We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?
__Priya No.
__Mrs Koothrappali Where is your brother?
__Priya Out with friends.
__Dr Koothrappali I don't like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.
__Mrs Koothrappali I'll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.
__Leonard You're moving back to India?
__Dr Koothrappali Who's that?
__Mrs Koothrappali Oh, my God! There's someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!
__Leonard When were you going to tell me about this?
__Priya Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh's friend Leonard.
__Dr Koothrappali I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.
__Priya He has many friends.
__Dr Koothrappali Rajesh has many friends?
__Mrs Koothrappali Why are you lying to us?
__Leonard She's lying because she doesn't want you to know we're dating.
__Priya Leonard!
__Leonard Well, what difference does it make? If you're moving back to India, we're obviously breaking up.
__Priya You know what? I don't want to deal with this right now.
__Leonard So. Hot in India?
__Dr Koothrappali Of course it is. It always is. It's India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?
__Leonard Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I said, what are you doing here?
__Leonard I live here.
__Sheldon I have paperwork that says differently.
__Leonard Priya's going back to India.
__Sheldon Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you're not going to ruin it.  What are you doing here?
__Howard I've been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
__Sheldon Why?
__Howard She gave me a beautiful watch.
__Sheldon Leonard, do you understand this?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Talk to him.
__Penny Damn.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Penny Oh. It's, it's not what it looks like.
__Sheldon What does it look like?
__Leonard What are you grinding about?
__Sheldon Penny's brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it's not what it looks like.
__Leonard Just let it go, Sheldon.
__Sheldon If I could, I would, but I can't, so I shan't. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that's what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let's put on our thinking cap, shall we?  Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.  Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That's a true blue friend.
__Leonard They slept together, Sherlock.
__Sheldon No, you weren't listening. She said, it's not what it looks like.
__Leonard She lied.
__Sheldon Oh. Well don't I look silly sitting here wearing this?
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Hey.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?
__Leonard No, I'm fine with it.
__Sheldon That sounds like sarcasm, but I'm going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don't see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.
__Leonard What the hell is wrong with you?
__Howard Yeah, how could you do that?
__Raj What is it to you?
__Howard I got his back.
__Raj Yeah, right. You're just jealous because it turns out I'm Penny's number two choice after Leonard.
__Howard Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.
__Leonard Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.
__Raj Why do you care so much? You're dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.
__Leonard and Howard together What?
__Sheldon Gentlemen, if I may interject, I've decided my rank will be captain. If it's good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it's good enough for me.
__Howard You're not in love with Penny.
__Raj Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.
__Howard Who?
__Raj He's the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.
__Leonard Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.
__Howard I'm sorry. What?
__Raj Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.
__Leonard Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
__Raj That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.
__Sheldon For the record, I do have genitals. They're functional and aesthetically pleasing.
__Amy Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you've had a few.
__Penny You heard what I did?
__Amy Well, I heard who you did.
__Penny Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.
__Amy Don't be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?
__Penny No.
__Amy She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.
__Penny I'm… I'm sorry. What does this have to do with me?
__Amy She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I'm sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.
__Bernadette What the hell is wrong with you?
__Raj Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.
__Bernadette I'm nice to everyone.
__Raj I'm sorry.
__Bernadette Damn right, you're sorry. And you tell Howard there's never been anything between us.
__Raj I will. Hey, Bernadette?
__Bernadette What?!
__Raj Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
__Bernadette Of course you do. You're a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.
__Amy You can't blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.
__Penny You know what? Let's get out of here.
__Amy Where are we going?
__Penny Somewhere where no one's seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile.
__Sheldon Subtlety isn't her strong suit, is it?
__Penny Can I stay at your place for a few nights?
__Amy Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.
__Penny Yeah, sure. Yay!
__Amy We'll make popcorn, stay up all night and I'll teach you my secret language, Op.
__Penny Sounds great.
__Amy Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.
__Penny Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.
__Amy No, you're not. You're gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.
__Sheldon Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can't see you.
__Leonard I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you're upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help.
__Leonard I don't want to talk to Amy.
__Sheldon No, it's not Amy.
__Dr Hofstadter Hello, dear.
__Leonard You called my mother?
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?
__Dr Hofstadter He's been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.
__Leonard What's going on? What do you want?
__Dr Hofstadter Sheldon informed me that you're experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I'm here to help.
__Dr Hofstadter And we're back to the obvious. Now, what's up?
__Leonard Well, uh, okay, um, I don't want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work, but I can't deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj's sister Priya, who I've been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I'm just completely confused and alone.
__Dr Hofstadter I understand.
__Leonard Got any advice?
__Dr Hofstadter Yes. Buck up.
__Leonard Excuse me. You're a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you've got is buck up?
__Dr Hofstadter Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.
__Leonard Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.
__Dr Hofstadter If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.
__Penny You know, I don't even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven't gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.
__Amy Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.
__Penny I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.
__Amy No, I can't let you do that.
__Penny Why not?
__Amy For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.
__Raj Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?
__Amy A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.
__Penny How did you know I was here?
__Raj It's all over her Facebook page.
__Penny Thanks.
__Amy No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?
__Penny So, hi. What's up?
__Raj I was wondering if you're free Friday. They're having a Totally '80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.
__Penny Oh. Gee, that's really sweet, but the thing is…
__Raj Aw, there's a thing.
__Penny Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should've never slept together. It's what ruins friendships.
__Raj You can't ruin a friendship with sex. That's like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
__Penny Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.
__Raj Oh. All right.
__Raj Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn't have sex in the conventional sense.
__Penny Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?
__Raj No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.
__Penny Oh, you did, didn't you?
__Raj Of course. I'm always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.
__Raj I did. It was beautiful.
__Penny Oh!
__Raj Penny, please, please promise me you won't tell anybody about this.
__Penny Of course I won't. No, I won't.
__Raj Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?
__Penny Sure.
__Raj Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I'm too rock and roll to be tied down?
__Penny No.
__Raj Can I say I ruined you for white men?
__Penny Also no.
__Raj Okay, just the candle thing.
__Raj Cool. All right friend.
__Penny Hmm.
__Raj I'll see you around.
__Penny Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend.
__Raj Penny?
__Penny Mm-hmm?
__Raj It's getting beautiful again.
__Howard I don't see anything.
__Sheldon Give it a second to load. Whenever you're ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they're out of sunblock, which means they'll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That's our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won't know what hit them. All right, let's move out.
__Leonard Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?
__Howard Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.
__Raj Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
__Leonard You know what, guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?
__Howard Fine with me.
__Raj Sure, whatever.
__Sheldon You can't quit. That's a court-martial offence. That's punishable by… You can't quit.
__Leonard Sorry, Sheldon, it's just not a good time for playing games.
__Sheldon This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?
__Leonard Yes, no and no.
__Howard Let it go, Sheldon. I'll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.
__Sheldon No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that's what we're going to be.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.  Geology isn't a real science!
__Howard Damn those sons of bitches!
__Leonard Let's get 'em!
__Sheldon If there's ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!
__Howard and Raj Here, here.
__Sheldon Excuse me. It's Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It's kind of a big deal.
__Penny Hi. You guys have a minute?
__Leonard Uh, yeah, sure.
__Penny Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.
__Raj Please, Penny, let me. We've decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you're feeling blue or you're in the shower.
__Penny Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?
__Raj Sorry. Go on.
__Penny Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I've been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It's time for me to move back to Nebraska.
__Leonard You're leaving?
__Penny Yeah.
__Howard What are you going to do in Nebraska?
__Penny I don't know, maybe teach acting.  Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?
__Leonard Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you're not doing this 'cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you're a single woman.
__Penny Shh! It's my agent, it's my agent. You're kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it! Really? Oh, I'm so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.
__Sheldon What about Nebraska?
__Penny Oh, hell with Nebraska. I'm gonna be a star!
__Sheldon Have you ever thought of teaching physics?
__Penny I don't think so, Mom. Not today.
__Actress Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?
__Penny You don't know the half of it.
__Actress Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this.
__Penny Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?
__Actress Now, the H is for Her.
__Leonard I'm proud of you.
__Penny Shh! Here comes my joke.
__Actress How are you doing?
__Penny Sittin' pretty.
__Leonard Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.
__Sheldon It's eight o'clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
__Leonard Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.
__Sheldon All right, so technically it's not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?
__Leonard That doesn't sound like mocking.
__Sheldon You didn't let me finish. Dinfast  Are those soy-based candles?
__Leonard I don't know. Why?
__Sheldon Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast
__Leonard Listen, I don't want to be rude, but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so…
__Sheldon Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.
__Leonard Yes, I've always admired that about you.
__Sheldon As well you should. But I'm going to make an exception here.
__Leonard Oh, good.
__Sheldon Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.
__Leonard A hobby?
__Sheldon Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
__Leonard You know, some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance. They'd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
__Leonard You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
__Sheldon Don't you like Amy?
__Leonard Of course I like Amy.
__Sheldon Well, there's the difference.
__Leonard Excuse me, that's Priya.
__Priya Hi, Leonard.
__Leonard Hey, honey.
__Leonard Oh, I miss you, too.
__Sheldon I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
__Penny Oh, it's no problem. It's actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We're like an old married couple.
__Sheldon If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.
__Penny I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
__Sheldon A good wife would go to the store.
__Penny I want a divorce.
__Sheldon Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.
__Sheldon It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.
__Penny What name?
__Sheldon Chair.
__Penny Oh, all right, well, I'm glad you like it. I mean, I still can't get over the fact someone just threw it away.
__Sheldon What?
__Penny Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.
__Sheldon Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
__Penny What is wrong?
__Penny Sheldon, take it easy.
__Sheldon You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
__Penny I went into this marriage with so much hope.
__Sheldon There's a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.
__Leonard That's three minutes. Should we see what we got?
__Howard Hang on.
__Raj Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.
__Howard Hand me the tuna melt.
__Leonard Yep.
__Howard Thank you. How's it going with the long-distance love affair?
__Leonard Not easy, but we're making it work.
__Howard When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?
__Howard You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.
__Raj Come on, dude. This is my sister you're talking about.
__Howard Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.
__Leonard There's no junk jiggling. We just talk.
__Howard Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.
__Leonard I can't do that.
__Howard Well, if you don't, you're gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.
__Raj How can you be so racist?
__Howard Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.
__Leonard I did it last night, I'm not doing it again.
__Howard Just his head, right?
__Leonard I don't want to talk about it. You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.
__Sheldon Yes, I did. And now they're cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.
__Leonard Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
__Leonard How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you'd started growing again.
__Sheldon I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.
__Penny Yello.
__Sheldon You need to remove that chair from the building. It's a health hazard.
__Penny Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.
__Sheldon Really?
__Penny Yeah. It's cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
__Sheldon It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That's reassuring.
__Penny Why don't you give it a try, Sheldon?
__Sheldon All right. It is a comfortable chair.
__Penny Why don't you just admit you overreacted?
__Sheldon No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny's apartment.
__Leonard It's like living with a Chihuahua.
__Sheldon Sheldon (at Penny's door):  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
__Penny What's up, buttercup?
__Sheldon You have to get rid of the chair.
__Penny Nope.
__Sheldon Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
__Penny What's the word, hummingbird?
__Sheldon For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
__Penny What's the gist, physicist?
__Sheldon Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned.  As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room.   Penny.  Penny.   Penny.
__Priya Yep, here we are.
__Leonard Okay, so I, I, I guess I'll just jump right in.
__Priya All right.
__Leonard Uh, you're a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?
__Priya What?
__Leonard Not good?
__Priya That's terrible. Try again.
__Leonard Okay. Uh, uh, you're not naughty. Uh, you're, you're, you're dirty. You're, you're a, a dirty girl?
__Priya Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
__Priya God, Leonard, stop talking.
__Leonard Why don't you just give me five minutes? I'll Google how to do this. I'll call you right back.
__Priya Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.
__Leonard Okay, like usual. Good.
__Priya Take off your shirt.
__Leonard All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
__Priya I said be quiet.
__Leonard Yes, ma'am.
__Priya Now take off your shorts.
__Priya Wonderful. Now I'll take off my clothes.
__Leonard Cool.  Uh-oh!
__Priya Here I am, baby. You miss these?
__Leonard Oh, damn it!
__Priya Oh, Leonard! Already?
__Leonard No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It's probably just buffering, just give it a second.
__Priya Fine.
__Leonard So, how are your mom and dad?
__Priya Yeah, I really don't want to talk about my parents now.
__Leonard Yeah. Sure, sure.
__Sheldon If your video's frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.
__Leonard Oh! I didn't even think of that. Thanks.
__Sheldon You're welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I'm trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.
__Sheldon Amy.  Amy.  Amy.
__Amy Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Amy Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
__Sheldon No.
__Amy How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff'rent Strokes? Now the world don't move to the beat…
__Sheldon No.
__Amy Well, that's every song I know. What's up?
__Sheldon You're good friends with Penny, right?
__Amy Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.
__Sheldon I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
__Amy For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?
__Sheldon Cholera is water-borne. You're mocking me.
__Amy Yes, I am.
__Sheldon Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
__Amy Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn't mean I have to participate.
__Sheldon All right, name your price.
__Amy Kiss me where I've never been kissed before.
__Sheldon You mean like Salt Lake City?
__Amy Never mind. I'll talk to Penny.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Amy Will you listen to me play my harp now?
__Sheldon No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I'm going to experience an episode from my past.  I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't be mad at me. Don't do that!
__Howard What? You're having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you're doing to hers. See? Internet kissing.  Give it a try.
__Leonard I don't think so.
__Raj I'll try it. Like this?
__Howard Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.
__Raj Like this?
__Howard Close. Really French it.
__Raj Better?
__Howard Yeah, you got it, you got it.
__Howard Whoa! You just bit my tongue!
__Raj I, I nibbled. I was being playful.
__Howard Why do you have to make everything weird?
__Raj Sorry. Better?
__Howard Oh, yeah.
__Amy I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
__Penny You're kidding.
__Amy Everything except bra and panties. And they're a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.
__Penny And now me.
__Amy I just have one question about the chair.
__Penny And what's that?
__Amy Aren't you worried about it being unhygienic?
__Penny No, it's completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
__Penny Really?
__Amy Yes, he did. He absolutely did.
__Penny My God, Amy, that's really crappy of you.
__Amy It is?
__Penny Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
__Amy No, I am your friend. Please don't be mad at me.
__Penny I can't even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.
__Amy No, no, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I'm, uh, I'm sitting in your chair. There's nothing wrong with it. It's a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!
__Penny What's wrong?
__Amy Something in the chair's biting my tushy. It's not important. Ow!
__Penny Wait. Get up, get up!  Swear you won't tell Sheldon what happened!
__Amy I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I'm probably gonna need shots!
__Penny Yeah, sure!
__Priya Oh, Leonard, listen…
__Leonard No, you listen. You're my woman, and I'm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.
__Priya Leonard…
__Leonard That's right, say my name, and beg me for more, 'cause, I'm gonna give it to you.
__Priya My parents are here.
__Dr Koothrappali Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.
__Raj Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard's apartment, I wouldn't wind up sitting on the floor all the time.
__Howard On three?
__Together Three!
__Raj What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
__Penny Ooh, me.
__Sheldon Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.
__Penny Thank you all for this high honour.
__Sheldon I've seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.
__Howard All right, honey, if we're gonna make the movie, we should go.  This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée.  Yeah, well, now it means her.
__Bernadette It's okay if he wants to come.
__Howard Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.
__Penny All right, I got to go to work. I'll walk down with you.
__Sheldon Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?
__Howard Neither of them are close.
__Sheldon Oh, well, then I guess it doesn't matter which one of you drives me. Let's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.
__Penny Okay, I'm not driving him.
__Sheldon No, Penny, don't give up, you can get this.
__Leonard Aren't you going with Sheldon?
__Amy No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.
__Leonard Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…
__Amy I can't imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.
__Leonard Okay. Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home?
__Amy Not really, no.
__Leonard All righty then. Guess I'll just get started.
__Amy Leonard, please. I don't need the running commentary.
__Amy Yo.
__Leonard You okay?
__Amy Oh, sure.
__Leonard I thought you were reading.
__Amy I was. Now I'm thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.
__Leonard I, I'm fine.
__Amy Should I go? I've been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.
__Leonard What, who told you that?
__Amy Well, most recently my gynaecologist.
__Leonard Well, you stay as long as you'd like.
__Amy I'm glad to hear you say that, because I'm having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm not buying anything. They're having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.
__Howard Which side do you come down on?
__Sheldon I'll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I'm going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it's O-gauge or no gauge.
__Howard Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
__Bernadette That's pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother's house.
__Howard First of all, they're not tricks, they're illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they're all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.
__Bernadette Why would I keep clothes at your mother's house?
__Howard Well, don't think of it that way. Once we move in, it'll be our house.
__Bernadette Is she moving out?
__Howard Why would she move out? It's her house.
__Bernadette Hang on. You seriously think I'm going to live with your mother?
__Sheldon Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that's exactly what he thinks.
__Howard Why not? It's a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom's there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.
__Bernadette I'm not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.
__Howard Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.
__Bernadette Raj, take me home.
__Howard Don't listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
__Bernadette Take me home now.
__Howard Movie theatre.
__Sheldon Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don't care what you people do.
__Leonard It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?
__Amy Oh, I'm up all night. I'm like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?
__Leonard Not really. Is that my yearbook?
__Amy Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you're really good at science. Maybe one day you'll come up with a cure for being a dork.
__Leonard Well, it wasn't spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.
__Amy If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.
__Leonard Aw.
__Amy Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.
__Sheldon Well, you can add Jerry's Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.
__Leonard Rough night, Casey Jones?
__Sheldon You don't know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
__Leonard What's in the bag?
__Sheldon I don't want to talk about it. But it's not a spine,I'll tell you that.
__Amy Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.
__Leonard Ah, sure. That'd be nice.
__Amy Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They're kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
__Leonard Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?
__Amy I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.
__Sheldon Not my fault. You said there'd be other scientists there my age.
__Amy Doesn't matter. You're out, he's in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.
__Sheldon Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.
__Mrs Wolowitz Could you get it?
__Howard I said I'm getting it!
__Mrs Wolowitz Fine, I'll get it!
__Howard I got it! Oh, hi.
__Bernadette Hey. I don't want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
__Howard Yeah, well, I'm sorry I didn't run it by you first.
__Mrs Wolowitz I don't know who you're talking to, but in or out! We don't need bugs!
__Howard The bugs only come here because you're their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it's like.
__Bernadette And your mom would be okay with that?
__Howard Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?
__Mrs Wolowitz Hey, if she's willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?
__Howard See? She's good with it.
__Mrs Wolowitz Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!
__Penny You're a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
__Amy Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?
__Penny Really? For a wedding?
__Amy Perhaps you're right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
__Leonard Ready.
__Penny Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
__Sheldon Better than James Bond, because he's tinier.
__Amy I got you this to give to me.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally wear corsages to a wedding. That's more of a prom thing.
__Amy I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.
__Penny Put the corsage on her.
__Leonard Amy, this is for you.
__Amy When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.
__Sheldon All aboard! Woo-woo! It's official. I'm an H-O trainiac.
__Mrs Wolowitz Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!
__Bernadette I'm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.
__Mrs Wolowitz You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!
__Howard Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?
__Mrs Wolowitz Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!
__Bernadette Oh, God.
__Howard Relax, it'll be fine.
__Bernadette Okay.
__Leonard No, thank you. I'm really not much of a dancer.
__Amy You're not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.
__Leonard I'm sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
__Amy Why shouldn't they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we'd stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.
__Leonard That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…
__Amy Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you're not holding up your end of the evening.
__Leonard Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.
__Amy I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who's playing with a model train right now, you don't hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.
__Leonard I'm not moody. I'm fun.
__Amy You have any evidence to support that statement?
__Leonard Well, hey, I'm just as much fun as you are.
__Amy Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.
__Leonard Okay, fine, what do you suggest?
__Amy We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you're sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don't we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.
__Leonard Once again, I, I'm really not much of a dancer.
__Amy Don't worry, I'll lead.
__Howard Ready for bed?
__Bernadette No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother's been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.
__Howard Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight's not your night!
__Mrs Wolowitz You don't know that! I just sat down!
__Howard Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!
__Mrs Wolowitz She can come in and brush her teeth! I'm not embarrassed!
__Howard Problem solved.
__Bernadette No, it's not. I'm not going in there.
__Howard Oh, come on, honey. She's just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can't see anything. I go in all the time.
__Mrs Wolowitz Ha! The eagle has landed!
__Howard And we have splashdown. Wait here, I'm gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.
__Leonard I just can't figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.
__Amy The hokey pokey is a young man's game.
__Amy You're welcome.
__Leonard And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
__Amy I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.
__Leonard Well, okay. Again, thank you.
__Amy And again, you're welcome.
__Leonard Want to come in, have a cup of tea?
__Amy No, thanks. I'm gonna head home.
__Leonard Okay. Well, good night.
__Amy Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny's door)
__Penny Ames, hi. How was the wedding?
__Amy Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
__Penny Come in, let's talk. Do you want a glass of wine?
__Amy Wine is one of the reasons I'm in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.
__Penny Okay, I'm sorry, what exactly happened?
__Amy The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let's face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.
__Penny Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
__Amy No, but it's only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I'm gonna have to break the little sad sack's heart.
__Penny Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay.
__Amy Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn't get my motor running.
__Penny So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?
__Amy No. I'll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I'll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot than he does.
__Leonard Sounds like you had a great night.
__Leonard Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
__Leonard Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin's a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?
__Sheldon To send a message. She is not for you.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Not for you!
__Howard Morning, Mom.
__Bernadette It's me.
__Howard Yes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning.
__Bernadette Your mom and I made you breakfast.
__Howard Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?
__Bernadette Yeah, I guess. We're very different people, Howard, so communication's a little tricky.
__Mrs Wolowitz Does he like the pancakes?!
__Howard Is there any butter?
__Bernadette It's butter-flavoured syrup.
__Howard Oh.
__Mrs Wolowitz So, what's the word?
__Bernadette He wants butter!
__Mrs Wolowitz It's butter-flavoured syrup
__Bernadette I just told him that!
__Howard I don't need any butter.
__Bernadette If you want butter, I'll get you butter.
__Howard Well, I guess I'll cut these by myself.
__Howard I say, hey Ma, what's for dinner?”
__Sheldon Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.
__Leonard Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?
__Howard Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy's registering for gifts. Looks like I'm finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I've always wanted.
__Leonard See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.
__Howard You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
__Leonard Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
__Sheldon You see a dragon.
__Howard Really? So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn't that a little on the nose?
__Sheldon When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?
__Leonard Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
__Raj Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
__Leonard Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?
__Leonard Now that Howard's getting married, maybe he'll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.
__Raj You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
__Howard Eat another pie, you'll have your own bazongas.
__Raj That's cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, please focus. You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.
__Raj I don't know if I want to play anymore.
__Sheldon Because you don't have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game's in serious trouble.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Yeah, my bikini region is fine.
__Amy Who's shocked? I'm not. So, Bernadette, how's the wedding planning going? And I'm not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!
__Bernadette We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.
__Penny Oh, the poor guy's so lonely. We should set him up with someone.
__Bernadette You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She's married to a guy in one of our drug trials.
__Penny Well, hello? She's married.
__Penny Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.
__Sheldon One moment. I'm conducting an experiment.
__Howard With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
__Sheldon Yes. From here on in, I've decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.
__Howard So, what's for dinner?
__Sheldon A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
__Howard Uh, I don't want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.
__Penny Uh, no, that's not it. Just come with me, please.
__Sheldon Let's see what I'll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
__Leonard Do you really want that?
__Sheldon That's the great thing. It doesn't matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
__Raj What's it thinking about now?
__Sheldon Hamburgers and lemonade.
__Penny Um, Raj, there's someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can't hear you. She's deaf.
__Howard Emily, this is our friend Raj.
__Penny Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
__Raj Hi.
__Howard She says it's nice to meet you.
__Raj Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
__Howard Raj says it's nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.
__Raj Okay, I'm going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.
__Howard He'll text you.
__Raj Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.
__Sheldon And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That's what I'm talking about!
__Howard Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
__Raj Oh, she's here.
__Howard No joke. Oh, she says she's sorry she's late.
__Raj Tell her it doesn't matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.
__Howard Really? That's the first thing you want to say?
__Raj I worked on it all night. Use it.
__Howard Look, I don't know the sign for opalescent.
__Raj Then spell it.
__Howard I don't know how to spell it.
__Raj You're blowing this for me!
__Howard He likes your eyes.
__Raj You're making me sound like a caveman.
__Howard She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”
__Raj Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.
__Howard No.
__Raj Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.
__Howard She doesn't know what James Earl Jones sounds like.
__Raj Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.
__Howard You really want to ask her that?
__Raj You're right. Everyone loves music.
__Howard She says, do you play an instrument?
__Raj No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn't get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don't sign it like I'm bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that's right, I had servants.
__Howard Do you hear yourself
__Raj Yes, but she doesn't. So get signing, hand monkey.
__Howard Texting Bernadette that I'm gonna be late.
__Raj Dude, what is she saying?
__Howard It's a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.
__Raj What? Why?
__Howard The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!
__Howard Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.
__Raj Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?
__Howard I speak sign language, I don't read minds.
__Raj If you were me, would you kiss her?
__Howard Yeah, but I'm a make out king.
__Raj I was so smooth on that date.
__Howard You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.
__Raj Whatever, dude. She kissed me.
__Howard It might've been on your lips, but it was my kiss.
__Raj Oh, fine. Let's agree she kissed both of us.
__Howard Okay.
__Sheldon Don't thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
__Howard Why are you still doing this?
__Sheldon Because it's working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I've co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I'm close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.
__Leonard You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.
__Sheldon The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
__Penny Is Raj out with Emily again?
__Leonard Yeah, every night for the last month.
__Penny Wow, can't believe he has a girlfriend.
__Sheldon Me neither.
__Howard Here's some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
__Leonard You think she's taking advantage of him?
__Penny Oh, of course not. She wouldn't do something like that. She's deaf.
__Leonard Deaf women can't be gold diggers?
__Penny Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.
__Sheldon Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.
__Sheldon Let's see.  Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.
__Penny Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
__Sheldon Okay, get this. It doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.
__Penny What do you mean, vastly wealthy?
__Sheldon Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I'm not sure what's tripping you up.
__Leonard Look, I know they have money. I don't think it's that much.
__Sheldon No, you're wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren't just rich, they're Richie Rich rich.
__Penny Well, so how much is that?
__Sheldon About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
__Howard What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.
__Leonard Listen, guys, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj's sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.
__Penny Okay, so he's got money, and it's a few gifts and a car.
__Howard And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
__Penny What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could've dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn't have, because I'm not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.
__Howard He's not going to listen, he's in love.
__Sheldon Can't figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to…  stay right here.
__Penny No. I'm the one that introduced him to her. I've got to say something.
__Howard Wow.
__Penny You're engaged to my friend.
__Howard Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.
__Penny I can't believe you're engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.
__Howard Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can't hear you.
__Penny Hi.
__Howard Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.
__Penny Um, can we talk to you about Raj?
__Howard She says, sure, what about him?
__Howard Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.
__Penny Okay, wait…
__Raj How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
__Penny We didn't mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it's kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?
__Raj I'm hammered.
__Penny Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?
__Raj The best one I ever had!
__Penny Okay, come on. You know you can do better.
__Raj Aha. I see what's going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can't stand to see me with another woman.
__Penny Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
__Raj It's okay. I can't get mad at your feelings.
__Penny I don't have feelings.
__Raj Yeah, that's good. Keep telling yourself that.
__Penny He is cuter now that I know he's rich.
__Dr Koothrappali No, it's not a nice surprise, it's a bad surprise.
__Mrs Koothrappali Penny called us.
__Raj Penny?
__Mrs Koothrappali She told us you're spending all our money on your new girlfriend.
__Raj I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.
__Dr Koothrappali Yeah, yeah, I'm a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.
__Mrs Koothrappali You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you're cut off.
__Raj What? You're going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
__Dr Koothrappali It's up to you.
__Raj Well, I choose love.
__Dr Koothrappali Hah. You're an idiot. Love doesn't last. Well, he's going to find out eventually. Think about it.
__Raj My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you.  No, I think we'll have to return the car.  And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.
__Penny I know, I know.
__Raj Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she's still with me. But I can't watch the closed captioning without crying.
__Penny Oh, I'm so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.
__Raj Seriously? I'm heartbroken and you're hitting on me?
__Penny What? No!
__Raj Look, Penny, you're great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.
__Howard Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
__Sheldon Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that's not what you want to see after three buttermilks.
__Penny Here you go, boys. I'll pick it up when you're ready.
__Howard Thanks for dinner, buddy.
__Leonard Yeah, real big of you.
__Sheldon Hurry, hurry, hurry.
__Penny Oh, and don't cheap out on the tip. We all know you're loaded now.
__Sheldon I don't know. If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I've long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?
__Leonard What did you have in mind?
__Sheldon Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.
__Leonard It would be a replica of a movie prop.
__Sheldon Fair enough. It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.
__Leonard Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?
__Sheldon Mm. Tough decision. There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
__Leonard Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.
__Sheldon Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly? Okay, let's go for it.
__Stuart Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.
__Leonard Yeah. It's okay, I guess.
__Sheldon Okay? It's magnificent.
__Leonard Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
__Stuart Oh, it's hard to put a price on something that's a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let's say 250?
__Leonard Oh, that's pretty steep.
__Sheldon Only 8,000? We're wasting precious time. Buy it.
__Leonard Hang on. Can you do any better?
__Stuart Are you kidding? I'm already giving you the friends and family discount.
__Sheldon Oh, did you hear that? We're getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.
__Leonard Slow down. Two hundred.
__Sheldon What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
__Leonard Will you shut up?
__Stuart Tell you what, I'll go two thirty-five.
__Leonard Nope. Maybe another time.
__Stuart Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.
__Sheldon Take it, take it.
__Leonard Two hundred.
__Stuart Man, you're killing me!
__Sheldon Killing you? I can't breathe.
__Stuart Two ten, and I'm losing money.
__Sheldon Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.
__Leonard Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
__Stuart Are you crazy? That helmet's signed by Robert Downey Jr.
__Stuart Okay, if you're going to question the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!
__Leonard Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.
__Stuart Thank you. I can eat meat this week.
__Leonard See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
__Sheldon I've long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.
__Stuart You want me to wrap it?
__Leonard No, it's okay. I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.
__Wil Wheaton Hey, Stuart.
__Stuart Ah, hey, Wil.
__Sheldon Hello, Wil Wheaton.
__Wil Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
__Wil No.
__Sheldon I'm not surprised.
__Stuart Here's the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.
__Wil Awesome. What do I owe you?
__Stuart Forty bucks.
__Wil Good deal.
__Sheldon Sucker. Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount.
__Wil Hey, I'm having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.
__Stuart Will there be girls there?
__Wil Yeah, of course.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Wil All right, great. Later.
__Sheldon I see what you're doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we're going to be there, and when we don't show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.
__Leonard I was actually thinking about going.
__Sheldon And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.
__Leonard No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.
__Stuart Oh, great, more guys. It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Possibly.
__Leonard Can you or can't you?
__Sheldon It's not that simple, Leonard.
__Leonard It never is, is it?
__Sheldon At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton's party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I'm characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger's Friendship.
__Leonard Got it. Can I have my water?
__Sheldon Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.
__Sheldon In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment…
__Penny No, no, no, no, I didn't forget. Um, there's this cat in a box and until you open it, it's either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother's camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.
__Amy Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You're the whole package, aren't you?
__Howard Sorry I'm late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team's design for the deep field space telescope that's going on the International Space Station this spring.
__Bernadette Howie, that's wonderful! Congratulations!
__Howard It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.
__Sheldon Mohammed Lee.
__Howard Who's Mohammed Lee?
__Sheldon Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn't know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.
__Howard It's me, Sheldon. It's me. I'm going up in space! Technically, I'm an astronaut.
__All Wow, that's amazing!
__Bernadette Hang on a second. NASA doesn't have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?
__Howard Oh, well, it's really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.
__Bernadette Are those Russian rockets safe?
__Howard Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.
__Leonard I'd like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard's making that a reality. We're all very proud of you.
__All Cheers.
__Sheldon That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.
__Bernadette Fine. Just a little tired.
__Howard I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.
__Bernadette I always catch your drift.
__Howard All right, well, something's obviously bugging you. What is it?
__Bernadette I just can't believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
__Howard Oh, I get it. You're worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there's a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.
__Bernadette What did you think was going to happen?
__Howard Honestly? Sex.
__Bernadette Howard.
__Bernadette Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We're supposed to be partners. We're supposed to be a team.
__Bernadette Okay.
__Howard I've been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?
__Bernadette Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.
__Howard Hey, we're a team. So, what do you think?
__Bernadette No.
__Howard No?
__Bernadette No.
__Howard Well why not?
__Bernadette Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don't want to live that way with you.
__Howard Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.
__Bernadette Oh, boo-hoo, you're not going to space!
__Sheldon Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.
__Leonard For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.
__Sheldon Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?
__Leonard You never stop talking, do you?
__Amy I don't understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party?
__Amy Mortal enemy?
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Amy Sheldon, I know you're a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?
__Sheldon In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?
__Penny Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.
__Sheldon You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This'll just take a moment. It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
__Amy A floppy disk?
__Sheldon Well, I started the list when I was nine.
__Amy How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
__All Oh! Oh, God!
__Sheldon As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.
__Howard Change your mind about sex? I'm still mad, but I'll do it.
__Bernadette No, I've just been thinking. It doesn't matter if I'm afraid for your safety. I don't want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.
__Howard Really?
__Bernadette Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.
__Howard Thank you.
__Bernadette I love you.
__Howard I love you, too. So, sex now?
__Bernadette Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I'll be right back.
__Mrs Wolowitz Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!
__Bernadette I'm ready.
__Howard What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
__Raj Wow. You're not only our first astronaut. You're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You're like a rock star.
__Howard Little bit.
__Leonard I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.
__Sheldon Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.
__Leonard Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.
__Sheldon Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it's doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you're looking for.
__Leonard I'm going to a party. I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
__Sheldon Not yet.
__Raj So, what's gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?
__Howard I don't know. If we're going to get back together, she's going to have to apologize and accept that I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions.
__Raj Then she's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
__Howard Obviously.
__Amy You're kidding.
__Penny No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.
__Bernadette I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't want to break up over this.
__Penny Okay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?
__Amy It's not for us to judge. We're just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you've done.
__Bernadette Oh, God, you're right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.
__Penny Well, that, that's good. I'm glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.
__Bernadette What?
__Penny Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
__Bernadette I do, with all my heart.
__Penny Got it. Just had to check.
__Amy He's great.
__Sheldon No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you're going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.
__Leonard You want to drive?
__Raj Sure.
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.
__Leonard No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.
__Sheldon Brent Spiner?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon I don't care.
__Leonard Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.
__Sheldon I did, but I think I've kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.
__Leonard I'm going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.
__Howard Tell her I'm not home!
__Mrs Wolowitz What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!
__Bernadette Can we talk?
__Howard You can. I have nothing to say.
__Bernadette All right. I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry I said something to your mother.
__Howard I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.
__Bernadette I know. I'm sorry. I got scared.
__Howard If you're gonna love me, you're gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.
__Bernadette I know.
__Howard Well, don't say it if you're not gonna mean it, 'cause I'm not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.
__Bernadette Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.
__Howard Well, those big kids were rocking it.
__Bernadette I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.
__Howard Really?
__Bernadette You're my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
__Howard Right, right.
__Mrs Wolowitz Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!
__Leonard Yeah.
__Raj Well, I just met her gynaecologist!
__Leonard What are you doing here?
__Sheldon Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you're still my little buddy. I'm not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let's meet Brent Spiner and go home.
__Wil Hey, Sheldon, I'm so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.
__Sheldon What I'd like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
__Wil This is for you.
__Sheldon An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
__Wil I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn't show up.
__Wil Look at what I wrote.
__Sheldon To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.
__Wil It's my last one. I want you to have it.
__Sheldon Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!
__Brent Spiner Oh, wow. I haven't seen one of these in years.  Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?
__Brent Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?
__Sheldon You've already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.
__Wil Don't worry. It doesn't take up a whole lot of your time.
__Sheldon Come on, buddy. Let's not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.
__Leonard Can we get autographed dolls?
__Brent Sure. Twenty bucks.
__Leonard Ten.
__Brent Eighteen.
__Leonard Twelve.
__Leonard Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
__Brent Done.
__Sheldon Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.
__Mrs Cooper You're missing out. It's gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It's all themed. There's Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God.
__Leonard What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire 'em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord's forgiveness.
__Sheldon Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.
__Mrs Cooper For example, if Shelly was aboard, he'd write “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!
__Sheldon The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.
__Mrs Cooper Sounds delicious.
__Sheldon Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother's fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.
__Leonard Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn't want to cook.
__Sheldon Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she's too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
__Mrs Cooper Actually, I wouldn't mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Won't that spoil our appetites for the chicken you're going to make me?
__Leonard All right, that settles it, we're going out. Do you like sushi? There's a great little place down the street.
__Mrs Cooper I've never had it, but there's no harm in trying something new.
__Sheldon There's a lot of harm in trying something new. That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
__Leonard Sheldon, you're talking like a crazy person.
__Mrs Cooper Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he's fine.
__Sheldon Told you.
__Mrs Cooper Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston.
__ Credits Sequence.
__Sheldon Stop yelling! I'm not happy about this.
__Leonard What's the last thing you were ever happy about?
__Sheldon The prospect of fried chicken.
__Mrs Cooper This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it's just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben's. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don't make it sushi.
__Leonard Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, I thought the one we couldn't say was ching chong.
__Leonard Yeah, yeah, that, too.
__Mrs Cooper So, Shelly, what's up with you and your friend Amy, if you don't mind a mother prying a bit?
__Sheldon Well, there's actually big news on the Amy front. She's been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.
__Mrs Cooper Do you have any idea what's going on with those two?
__Leonard It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't. We'll probably never know. But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.
__Mrs Cooper How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation?
__Leonard Uh, yeah, it's Raj's sister. It's kind of tough. She's in India. Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can't force things. You need to figure out if you're in a relationship or if you're just calling it one. It's like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don't make 'em biscuits.
__Mrs Cooper Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.
__Leonard Please pester her. Please, for me.
__Mrs Cooper It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?
__Sheldon I don't know. Lately we've been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
__Leonard Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
__Sheldon Get them before they get us.
__Raj Hey, look who decided to show up.
__Leonard Raj, what are you doing?
__Raj I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.
__Sheldon Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.
__Raj Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
__Mrs Cooper Well, it's so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.
__Leonard We don't say that, either. I'll make you a list.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?
__Raj Nothing, I'm fine.
__Mrs Cooper Are ya?
__Raj No.
__Raj I'm so lonely.
__Sheldon Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It's a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you'll excuse my mother, she's about to make a pecan pie that'll be so good I'll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.
__Sheldon Offer them a hot beverage.
__Mrs Cooper And when they're drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?
__Sheldon Coffee.
__Mrs Cooper And what do we do it with?  Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can't find someone, but there's a lock for every key. Back home, there's a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she'd never find a man, then one day, wouldn't ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.
__Raj I didn't get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.
__Sheldon I'm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?
__Leonard You want some Oreos?
__Sheldon Double Stuf?
__Leonard No, regular.
__Sheldon Nice. Kick a man when he's down.
__Mrs Cooper Sure. One thing you really miss when you're on vacation is laundry.
__Sheldon Careful, you're using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.
__Mrs Cooper Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.
__Sheldon It is nice, isn't it?
__Penny Mrs. Cooper. Hi!
__Mrs Cooper Oh, hello, darlin'.
__Sheldon It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.
__Mrs Cooper So, how've you been?
__Penny Good, good.
__Penny Oh, fine. You know, it's been a while. I'm getting back out there.
__Mrs Cooper Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this?
__Penny Well, it's super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.
__Sheldon Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.
__Mrs Cooper Hon, you think maybe the reason why you're having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you're letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?
__Penny Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I'm going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?
__Mrs Cooper Oh, not crazy at all. And don't beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.
__Sheldon Now that will not be in this week's e-mail blast.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I've got a good book you could read.
__Howard Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.
__Mrs Cooper I bet your mom is really proud of you.
__Howard Nope. She says if I don't back out she's going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.
__Sheldon I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I'm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I've worked up a couple of Q's that will stump his sorry A.
__Mrs Cooper I don't know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.
__Sheldon What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
__Mrs Cooper Come on, Sheldon, we'll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.
__Penny Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.
__Mrs Cooper Well, I can't spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but it's free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.
__Howard What do you say?
__Sheldon What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.
__Howard He's not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.
__Mrs Cooper The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.
__Leonard Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?
__Mrs Cooper Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we're not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.
__Sheldon Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.
__Mrs Cooper Apology accepted.
__Sheldon Great. Now, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.
__Mrs Cooper I am still going out with your friends.
__Sheldon But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong.
__Mrs Cooper Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don't you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.
__Sheldon I'm not going, and you can't make me.
__Mrs Cooper You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.
__Sheldon Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.
__Mrs Cooper Well, then you are going to stand there all day.
__Leonard I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
__Sheldon I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me.
__Mrs Cooper I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.
__Sheldon We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.
__Mrs Cooper Well, I guess we are.
__Leonard Sorry. Syrup.
__Sheldon All right, Mom. When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son, believe it, because it's true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard's hand)
__Amy Are you getting sick?
__Amy Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn't making you a priority?
__Sheldon No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.
__Amy Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
__Sheldon Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.
__Amy Sheldon, we're all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you're just like everybody else.
__Sheldon Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
__Amy Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better.  Sure you're not coming down with a cold?
__Sheldon Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You'd love that, wouldn't you?
__Leonard Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.
__Mrs Cooper My goodness, it's a wonder you people in California can talk at all.
__Penny This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
__Leonard What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
__Penny Hey, they have wine here, don't they?
__Howard Yep, that's the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.
__Mrs Cooper Hey, while we're here, why don't we all do some praying? Let's put a little church in this church.
__Leonard Oh, I'm not sure we should.
__Mrs Cooper It's easy. I'll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.
__Penny Okay, um, hey, God. What's up? Um, I'm good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.
__Mrs Cooper She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you're up. Wasserman, you're on deck.
__Leonard Okay. I don't know, it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She's all the way in India. That would be great.
__Mrs Cooper Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?
__Howard Oh, me? No. Thanks, I'm good. I'm really just trying not to burst into flames.
__Mrs Cooper Rajesh?
__Howard He says he's having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
__Mrs Cooper Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.
__Howard No, you only get one wish.
__Mrs Cooper You take notes, darlin'. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He'll die at 50 but his love will be true.
__Sheldon I need a tissue.This one got wet.
__Leonard Here.
__Sheldon Thank you. Yeah, I've learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we're the same.
__Mrs Cooper Sweetheart, are you sick?
__Sheldon I hope so, because if this is well, life isn't worth living.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Mrs Cooper Don't worry. Mama's here to take care of her baby.
__Sheldon And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.
__Sheldon Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
__Mrs Cooper You can have whatever you want.
__Sheldon Thanks, Mom.You're the best.
__Sheldon I know, it filled in last year. I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.
__Mrs Cooper And whose fault was that?
__Mrs Cooper Shelly, you're not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.
__Sheldon No, we don't. The one we have works great.
__Mrs Cooper Sweetheart, you are a grown man.
__Sheldon Or maybe I'm part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I'm still basically a toddler.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.
__Sheldon Does this mean you're not going to sing Soft Kitty?
__Mrs Cooper No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty.  Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
__Leonard Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?
__Sheldon Get out!
__Mrs Cooper Well, that was rude.
__Sheldon Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.
__Mrs Cooper Happy kitty, sleepy kitty…
__Sheldon What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top.
__Mrs Cooper This is what I'm talking about.  Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
__Ghostly voice Sheldon, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hmm.  All right, all right. I see what's going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch's cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn.
__Ghostly voice Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.  Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.
__Raj You should've seen your face.
__Sheldon Yes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.
__Howard Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me.
__Raj He's probably right.
__Howard We can't beat him. He's just too smart.
__Sheldon Gentlemen.
__Howard Who had money on faints?
__Raj I had pee his pants.
__Leonard Hang on. Looks like everyone's a winner.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Droll.
__Howard Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine.
__Leonard That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
__Sheldon Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you've poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you've forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I'm Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.
__Stuart Hot girl, nine o'clock. Don't everybody look at once!
__Raj What is she doing in a comic book store?
__Stuart I don't know, she might be lost. Doesn't matter. Watch and learn. Hi.
__Hot girl Hi.
__Stuart Um… it-it-it…  Shut up.
__Hot girl Are you getting this Next Men?
__Leonard Uh, yeah. It's issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.
__Hot girl I know. I've been looking for it for years.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Hot girl Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?
__Leonard Yes, but you'd be using your superpowers for evil.
__Hot girl Damn, I'm forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.
__Leonard Leonard.
__Alice You are very cute, Leonard.
__Leonard Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.
__Alice No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?
__Leonard Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.
__Alice Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.
__Leonard Sorry, palm's a little sweaty. What's that word?
__Alice Alice.
__Leonard Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.
__Alice Later.
__Howard Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
__Stuart ‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.
__Leonard No, I don't think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.
__Stuart Doesn't matter. This is the closest anyone's ever come. You're going on the wall, my friend.
__Leonard How many times are you gonna tell me? What's with you?
__Sheldon Nothing. It's not suspicious that I'm fixating. It's consistent with my personality.
__Leonard Right.
__Penny Hey, guys.
__Leonard More Halloween candy? Didn't you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
__Penny Oh. Yeah. That's gone. It's a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
__Sheldon Leonard doesn't have time to chat, he has to get the mail.
__Leonard Will you relax? I'll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?
__Sheldon Open the mail!
__Leonard Excuse me.  A couple of circulars, nothing important.
__Penny What's with him?
__Leonard Hang on. (Sheldon opens mail box. A loud horn blows and a balloon with Leonard's face on pops out. Sheldon faints again.) You might be from Texas, but I'm from New Jersey.
__Alice What are you wearing?
__Alice Wow, you must have gotten so laid.
__Leonard No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
__Alice Want to see a comic I draw?
__Leonard You're kidding. You have your own book?
__Alice Yeah. It's kinda based on my life.
__Leonard Cool. Oh, look. That's you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?
__Alice You'd think, but no.
__Leonard You're very talented. This is really good. Did you do…
__Alice So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?
__Leonard You can have my car.
__Raj Good morning, Sheldon.
__Sheldon It is, isn't it? Oh, bother. Isn't that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you're out of staples. Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier today when I was at Staples.
__Raj You have a thing of paper clips right there.
__Sheldon well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don't you keep staples in your top desk drawer?
__Raj I don't know. Maybe.
__Sheldon Be a lamb and check.
__Raj All right.  Who do we have here?
__Sheldon It's a snake. A terrifying snake.
__Raj Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?
__Sheldon Stop talking like that. You've been rendered speechless by fear.
__Raj Let's go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
__Sheldon I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You're better than this.
__Leonard Hey, you got a minute?
__Penny Yeah, sure, come on in.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Penny Want some mac and cheese?
__Leonard No. Lactose. Gas.
__Penny Glass of wine?
__Leonard No. Sulfites. Migraines.
__Penny Okay, well, I'd offer you Halloween candy, but that's gone. So, what's up?
__Penny Oh, my God, that's where I know you from.
__Leonard I'm dealing with a situation and it's kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.
__Penny All right, what's going on?
__Leonard So, you're okay talking about this?
__Penny Yes.
__Leonard You're sure it's not weird.
__Penny It's okay.
__Leonard You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.
__Penny Okay, good, because there's this one guy I used to date who's about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn't get to the point.
__Leonard Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
__Penny Yeah, probably.
__Leonard Come on.
__Penny I'm sorry, go ahead.
__Leonard I met this girl, and she's great. We have a lot in common.
__Penny Did you guys do it?
__Leonard No. We just made out a little.
__Penny Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?
__Leonard Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.
__Penny That's gross.
__Leonard Here's the thing, I, I'm not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.
__Penny Well, good for you.
__Leonard The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.
__Penny So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
__Leonard Oh, that's not who I am.
__Penny All right, then break it off with the new girl.
__Leonard Now, let's not do anything rash. She's really hot.
__Penny If you like this girl so much, why don't you just end things with Priya?
__Leonard Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
__Penny Leonard, you're looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.
__Leonard Now we're getting somewhere.
__Penny What does your gut tell you?
__Leonard Go ask Penny; she'll know what to do.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon Science. You wouldn't understand.
__Leonard Hey, well, see you. I'm going out. (Starts to go out. Doesn't.)
__Sheldon I thought you were leaving the apartment.
__Leonard Yeah, me, too. I can't make up my mind.
__Sheldon Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
__Leonard No. I'm having a moral crisis.
__Sheldon Well, if it's of any help, I've read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.
__Leonard Oh, what the hell. I'm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don't know if I should, because I'm going out with Priya, but she's in India.
__Sheldon All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won't be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.
__Leonard Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn't do more than the stuff that you did, and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.
__Sheldon You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.
__Leonard That actually does help.
__Sheldon It's worth noting that he died of syphilis.
__Leonard Screw it, I'm going.
__Sheldon On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?
__Leonard Do you mind? I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
__Sheldon Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Great. Tropicana, no pulp.
__Bernadette Who is it?
__Sheldon It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.
__Howard That's not my mom, it's Bernadette.
__Sheldon Really? That's very unsettling.
__Bernadette Hi, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hi.
__Howard What's up?
__Sheldon It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.
__Howard Well, I, I'm gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don't you think it could have waited until then?
__Sheldon Holy smoke, why didn't I think of that? You're a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!
__Howard Whatever.  My… oh… it's…
__Bernadette Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?
__Sheldon It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
__Bernadette Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
__Sheldon Well, I thought he made that up. Isn't hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?
__Bernadette This is adrenaline, we're gonna have to inject it into his heart.
__Sheldon We are?
__Bernadette You are. I'm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we've only got one shot.
__Sheldon Oh, no! I can't!
__Bernadette Hurry! We're running out of time!
__Sheldon Okay.
__Bernadette Just do it!
__Sheldon Oh, God! One, two, three!
__Howard Trick or treat, bubbeleh.
__Sheldon What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu…
__Alice Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you're in for a real surprise later on.
__Leonard No, no, no. I, I can't do this. Believe me, I really want to.
__Alice But?
__Leonard But I kind of have a girlfriend.
__Alice Are you kidding?
__Leonard You're cool with you and me just being friends, right?
__Alice I don't believe this.
__Leonard Wait, I don't, which part?
__Alice I'm so stupid. I thought for once I'd met a good guy, but you're just another jackass.
__Leonard Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I'm gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that's not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That's kind of my superpower. I'm, like, Captain Good Guy.
__Priya Hey, sweetheart. How's it going?
__Leonard Uh, not so good. We have to talk.
__Priya Oh, sounds serious. What's up?
__Leonard Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it's done, it's never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.
__Priya Leonard, relax. It's okay.
__Leonard It is?
__Priya Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.
__Leonard Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don't deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?
__Priya Leonard, I didn't know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.
__Leonard Uh, kind of?
__Priya A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.
__Leonard No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.
__Priya Well, it's not a competition.
__Leonard Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I'm, I'm sorry, I have to go. I don't believe this.
__Sheldon Bazinga, punk. Now we're even.
__Bernadette Well, if you don't mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.
__Amy Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.
__Bernadette Really?
__Amy Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.
__Bernadette That's horrible.
__Amy Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.
__Bernadette I don't know. Dead people's dresses?
__Penny Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.
__Amy Uh, I was hoping you wouldn't notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.
__Sheldon Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one's fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I'm looking at no one in particular, Penny.
__Leonard Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?
__Howard What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?
__Sheldon I've prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
__Penny Okay, that time you looked at me.
__Amy Who didn't? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?
__Sheldon Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.
__Penny All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?
__Bernadette Oh, me.
__Penny Through no one's fault, Sheldon, we're leaving.
__Amy Wait for moi.
__Sheldon You're leaving?
__Amy Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.
__Sheldon Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?
__Raj Totally. What's wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they're adorable.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
__Sheldon She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
__Howard That's fun to have in a lunchroom.
__Amy The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you're going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who's been biting you all week.
__Howard Please, we're eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?
__Sheldon Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
__Leonard This time, it's your fault.
__Sheldon I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it's just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.
__Leonard Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?
__Amy I don't know, four or five years.
__Leonard No, it's not gonna do it.
__Howard Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.
__Amy They're out shopping right now?
__Howard Yeah.
__Amy Just the two of them?
__Howard I guess.
__Amy That's cool, that's cool.
__Howard Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is?
__Sheldon What?
__Sheldon Sorry. I'm a little distracted. I can't seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.
__Leonard Did you try calling her on the telephone?
__Sheldon The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.
__Leonard If you're worried, we can go over there and see if she's all right.
__Leonard I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
__Sheldon Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
__Leonard You do?
__Sheldon Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.
__Leonard Forget about the bobcat.
__Sheldon How can I? You won't stop talking about it.
__Leonard Uh, she's your friend. Step up.
__Leonard Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Bye.
__Sheldon Where are you going?
__Leonard I'm single, I don't need this crap.
__Amy Sheldon, what are you doing here?
__Sheldon You didn't respond to any of my electronic communications.
__Amy I wanted to be alone.
__Sheldon Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
__Amy Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.
__Sheldon Point of order. As you're in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I'm a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?
__Amy It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.
__Sheldon If you'd like to take your mind off what's troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.
__Amy Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I'm good at this.
__Amy It's just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.
__Sheldon When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone's craw.
__Amy Sheldon, I'm going to ask you something, and I'd like you to keep an open mind.
__Sheldon Always.
__Amy At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.
__Sheldon Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.
__Amy Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
__Sheldon Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who's a good Amy.
__Amy How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.
__Sheldon Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.
__Amy We cuddle. Final offer.
__Sheldon Very well. Oh, boy.
__Amy I'm just saying, second base is right there.
__Leonard For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
__Raj This is not a safe place. You can't share anything here.
__Sheldon The two of you need to get your women in line!
__Howard What?
__Sheldon Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.
__Howard What do you want us to do about it?
__Sheldon You clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone's snuggle bunny!
__Leonard Why do I have to talk to Penny? She's not my girlfriend.
__Sheldon You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!
__Penny Thank you. Where's Sheldon?
__Leonard Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.
__Bernadette That's so sweet.
__Leonard Yeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play.
__Howard So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She's kind of upset.
__Penny Why?
__Leonard Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
__Bernadette I told you that would happen.
__Penny Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she's just getting a little crazy with it.
__Bernadette She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they're all about getting naked and washing each other.
__Penny Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers
__Bernadette We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.
__Penny I know. Me, too. We'll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?
__Howard Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I'm sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn't thinking.
__Bernadette Oh, Howie.
__Howard Well, hey, I'm usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.
__Penny What do you tell him?
__Bernadette Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about.
__Leonard Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?
__Penny No. All your little secrets are fine.
__Bernadette Yes, absolutely fine.
__Penny Hi.
__Bernadette Hello.
__Amy What are you doing here?
__Penny Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.
__Amy That's not necessary, it's like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.
__Penny Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We'll have a girl's night, we'll do whatever you want.
__Bernadette We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.
__Penny With-with loofah mitts, no hands.
__Amy It's okay. I'm glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
__ the-right-light friend want to hang out with me.
__ Amy, we're really sorry.
__Penny Yeah, we feel awful.
__Amy Don't. I'll be okay. You're not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It's like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.
__Penny Oh, come on, Amy.
__Amy You don't get it. Look at this brain.
__Penny I don't really want to.
__Amy This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you're the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where's Amy? She's right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.
__Bernadette Amy, you're not a tumour. Penny, tell her she's not a tumour.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Sheldon It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
__Leonard Really? Amy?
__Sheldon Leonard, be glad you can't keep a woman. They are a handful.
__Leonard Hi, Amy.
__Amy Hey, Cuddles.
__Leonard Cuddles?
__Sheldon Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.
__Amy Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you're sad.
__Leonard Yeah, but why didn't you go back to your apartment?
__Amy Didn't you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.
__Leonard Maybe we should get you home.
__Amy Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?
__Leonard Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?
__Leonard Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
__Amy Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.
__Penny Hi.
__Amy What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
__Amy When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.
__Penny No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.
__Bernadette We know you're upset, and you have every right to be, but if it's okay with you, we'd like a second chance to make things right.
__Penny We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.
__Bernadette Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.
__Amy What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?
__Bernadette No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.
__Amy Oh, my gosh. No one's every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that's not true. Once, but then they all died.
__Bernadette So is that a yes?
__Amy Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There's the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we'll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we'll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette's naked body. So that's happening.
__Amy I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?
__Penny Sorry.
__Amy Really?
__Penny Okay, yeah.
__Amy Yay!
__Bernadette We're just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?
__Amy I'm sorry, are you the maid of honour?
__Bernadette I am the bride.
__Amy So no. And action.
__Penny What do you think?
__Bernadette I love it!
__Amy What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let's see some skin.
__ Cut to Amy in a lilac dress.
__ Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!
__Amy You think they don't have mirrors in there? I know how I look.
__ Cut to Bernadette in a wedding dress.
__ Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!
__Amy You do.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__Amy Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.
__ Cut to changing room door.
__ Come on, bestie, you're up.
__Penny Give me a minute.
__Amy What is taking you so long?
__Penny Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!
__Amy – Sorry, sorry.
__Penny Oh, God. Amy!
__Amy Sorry.
__Leonard Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?
__Penny Yeah. I've got eight pounds of salmon that's about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?
__Leonard Not really.
__Penny Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?
__Leonard Star Wars on Blu-ray.
__Penny Haven't you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?
__Leonard Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
__Penny Oh, Leonard.
__Leonard I know, it's high-resolution sadness.
__Penny Well, I'm going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?
__Leonard Really? Do we do that?
__Penny What do you mean?
__Leonard You know, we haven't spent time alone together since we broke up.
__Penny Oh, it's not a date, Leonard. It's just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.
__Leonard Sounds like most of my dates.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!
__Penny What is that about?
__Leonard Well, he's smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster.
__Sheldon Shoo, shoo! Be gone!
__Leonard What the hell is going on?
__Sheldon There's a bird outside the window, and he won't go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.
__Penny Really? On top of everything else, you're afraid of birds?
__Sheldon It's called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.
__Penny So movies, yes or no?
__Leonard Movies, yes.
__Penny Great. I'll see you later. And remember, he's more afraid of you than you are of him.
__Sheldon That doesn't help.
__Penny No, I was talking to the bird.
__Sheldon Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.
__Leonard Sheldon, just ignore him.
__Sheldon Good idea. Attention is what birds want.  Oh, much better. All right. Now I'll just get along with my life.  Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It's going to be a long night.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Quick, what does a hawk sound like?
__Leonard I don't know. Scree-scree.
__Sheldon Please, that's a seagull. If you're not going to help, don't help.
__Leonard Sorry. Do you think I'm overdressed?
__Sheldon It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you're playing Vegas, I'd add sequins.
__Leonard I'm going to the movies with Penny. I don't want her to think that I think it's a date.
__Sheldon Do you think it's a date?
__Leonard No, but she might think I think it's a date even though I don't.
__Sheldon Or you might think she thinks you think it's a date even though she doesn't.
__Leonard Are we overthinking this?
__Sheldon Not at all.
__Leonard You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.
__Sheldon Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I'm at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I'd like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I'm sorry, this is Animal Control. I don't understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you're frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you're stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don't you think I tried making cat noises?
__Sheldon For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.  What am I thinking? Whiskers!
__Leonard Oh, yeah, sure. There's also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.
__Penny Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she's not building a dam.
__Leonard Can't argue with that. I'll get the tickets.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Actually, you know what? I think it's about time I pick a movie we see.
__Penny You pick plenty of movies.
__Leonard No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.
__Penny But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.
__Leonard I hate those movies.
__Penny No, you don't.
__Leonard Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can't see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.
__Penny Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?
__Leonard All the time.
__Leonard Does this sound familiar? I'd love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It's great. It's two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn't?
__Penny Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.
__Leonard Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
__Penny No. No woman would.
__Leonard See? Now, that's the great thing. We're out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let's go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.
__Penny All right, fine.
__Leonard Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
__Howard I'm pushing play.
__Sheldon A minute.
__Howard If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.
__Sheldon This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
__Sheldon Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude and that's what's important.
__Raj I really don't get your problem with birds.
__Sheldon The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.
__Raj Hummingbirds are pretty.
__Sheldon Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
__Raj Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.
__Sheldon Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?
__Raj Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.
__Howard All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.
__Sheldon It's not a death ray. It's just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn't be living here. I'd be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows shatter. The bird doesn't move.)
__Raj That is one tough birdie.
__Penny No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can't.
__Leonard I'm going to get some fries. You want anything?
__Leonard Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.
__Penny I just eat the little crispy ones you don't like.
__Leonard No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they're gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?
__Penny To get sex.
__Leonard Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?
__Penny All right, I'd like an order of fries.
__Leonard Great. That'll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I'm so glad you suggested we do this.
__Penny Oh, sorry.
__Man No problem.
__Penny What you writing there?
__Man A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.
__Penny The Movie.
__Man It's a working title.
__Penny Oh.
__Man I'm Kevin.
__Penny Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.
__Kevin I'll let you get back to your date.
__Penny Oh, no, no. This isn't a date, no. Right?
__Leonard Uh, right.
__Kevin That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?
__Leonard You're kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?
__Penny Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?
__Kevin No problem.
__Penny What's up?
__Leonard I know what you're doing.
__Penny What am I doing?
__Leonard You're going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren't on a date.
__Leonard Come on, he's not that cute.
__Leonard I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
__Penny Yes, but when you're tall and have great cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.
__Leonard If that's so, what if I start talking to a girl?
__Penny You should.
__Leonard I'm serious. I'll do it.
__Penny Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?
__Leonard They're in a group. I'm scared.
__Sheldon You're biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That's a living thing, get cracking.
__Bernadette I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.
__Amy Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.
__Sheldon Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.
__Bernadette Come back in, Sheldon, he's not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone's pet.
__Sheldon No, Bernadette, don't be a hero!
__Bernadette Oh, he's a sweetie.
__Sheldon Yes. It's very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.
__Amy Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.
__Sheldon Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I'm not going to be another statistic.
__Bernadette Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don't be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!
__Sheldon I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.
__Leonard Um, let's see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.
__Penny Hey. Sorry I ditched you.
__Leonard No, it's fine. You can ditch away.
__Penny Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let's hang out.
__Leonard It's cool. Go back to Kevin.
__Penny Oh, he had to leave.
__Leonard Interesting. So now that he's gone, you want to hang out with me.
__Woman This must be Penny.
__Leonard Yep.
__Woman I totally get it.
__Penny Huh? I'm sorry, get what?
__Leonard Don't worry about it. You know, there's some guys over there. You should go talk to them.
__Penny No, no. I want to know what you told her.
__Leonard That's kind of between me and…
__Woman Laura.
__Leonard Laura.
__Penny Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?
__Laura Really?
__Penny Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.
__Leonard Hey, pal. You didn't see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.
__Penny Okay. Then I'll return the favour, and I won't tell…
__Laura Laura.
__Penny Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.
__Leonard When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?
__Penny Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
__Leonard Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.
__Penny A… S… Take me home.
__Leonard Maybe I'm not done hanging out with…  You're right, it's getting late.
__Sheldon My phone's on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I'd call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn't a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You're just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren't you?
__Amy Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.
__Bernadette I still think he looks like someone's pet. Maybe we should put up posters.
__Sheldon Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We're going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.
__Sheldon Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn't sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I'm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn't that right, LD?  No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He's gone.
__Amy I'm sorry, Sheldon.
__Sheldon How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!
__Penny Okay, I'm not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.
__Leonard I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I'm sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it's not like when we were going out, I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I'm sorry.
__Penny All right. Thank you. I'm sorry, too.
__Leonard Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?
__Penny Way off.
__Leonard Maybe we're not ready to hang out as friends.
__Penny I don't know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.
__Leonard Really?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Well, then, I'm putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?
__Penny Ooh. Maybe I like it.
__Leonard You do? Because if that's what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I'll be anything you want me to be.
__Penny Good night, Leonard.
__Leonard I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
__Sheldon Mine was great. I'm going to be a mommy.
__Leonard It's probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.
__Howard Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.
__Sheldon Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?
__Amy Sheldon, I'm disappointed. As a brilliant man, you're entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.
__Sheldon Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that's cool.
__Stuart Can I help you find anything?
__Amy A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can't be used as a floatation device.
__Stuart Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.
__Raj Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka'a expansion pack is out.
__Howard A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It's like a secret tax on guys who can't get laid.
__Raj They're not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?
__Howard Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?
__Raj A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
__Leonard Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?
__Howard What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we're talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka'a?
__Stuart Leonard, what's the deal with Sheldon's friend Amy? Are they a couple?
__Leonard Couple of weirdos. Why?
__Howard You interested in Amy?
__Stuart Well, I mean, she didn't look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?
__Leonard Sure. I guess.
__Raj Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?
__Stuart If I tell you that, I'm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin' tootin' low price of $24.95.
__Raj I'll take one.
__Howard Mmm, make it two.
__Leonard I hate all of you and myself. Three.
__Stuart I'll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you're at, you're wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.
__Leonard Yeah, that's not it. Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.
__Sheldon Oh, of course he is. She's very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?
__Leonard No. He wanted me to find out if you'd have a problem with him asking her out.
__Sheldon I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don't own Amy. Can't own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you're going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you'll have to know.
__Leonard You know what? Never mind. I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out.
__Sheldon The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.
__Leonard All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you'd feel about it.
__Sheldon Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.
__Leonard I am not washed-up.
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can't until you admit the problem.
__Amy I had half a glass.
__Bernadette I didn't have any.
__Amy Or we play Travel Twister.
__Bernadette Amy, really? Twister?
__Amy Excuse me. I've passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I'm sure it's a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I'm shirts. Called it.
__Bernadette I'm too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.
__Penny Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.
__Amy Guys, something happened.
__Penny What's wrong?
__Amy I think a boy likes me.
__Bernadette Hi. It's Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you'd like to get coffee sometime. It's okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.
__Penny Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.
__Bernadette What are you going to do? Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?
__Penny Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?
__Amy I don't know. He's nice. He's funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That's kind of hot.
__Penny Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you've been with him over a year now. If it's not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?
__Bernadette Well, yeah, I guess they're not engaged like me and Howie.
__Penny Yeah, for what it's worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.
__Speccy Guy Behind Counter Out.
__Sheldon Who are you?
__Speccy Guy I'm Dale. He left me in charge.
__Leonard Really?
__Dale Yeah. I don't get it, either.
__Leonard I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka'a expansion pack.
__Dale Sorry. I don't do returns. They're hard.
__Leonard Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?
__Dale I don't know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.
__Sheldon Oh, I guess I was wrong.
__Leonard You okay?
__Sheldon Am I okay? Leonard, I'm on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?
__Dale I'm okay, too!
__Leonard A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
__Sheldon Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes. We're playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie.
__Howard We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.
__Sheldon And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Howard Very.
__Raj Incredibly so.
__Sheldon Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Raj Incredibly so.
__Sheldon All right, fine. Let's just play.
__Howard Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon's patented blend of condescension and no sex isn't enough to hold on to a woman?
__Sheldon Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?
__Howard Sorry. Creepy Tepee.
__Raj Annie Ogly.
__Leonard Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
__Sheldon And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here.
__Howard You are.
__Raj Totally you.
__Leonard Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.
__Howard Ooh, a sheriff's badge.
__Raj Yeah, it's also a wand.
__Leonard With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?
__Sheldon I'm in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.
__Leonard You've got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
__Howard I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore.
__Sheldon Don't be silly. I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
__Raj Please. You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
__Sheldon Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?
__Raj You're so full of it.
__Sheldon You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
__Raj You unfriended me? Seriously?
__Howard Oh, yeah. Now he's gonna miss all those great updates like, I can't believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.
__Leonard Sheldon, why don't you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don't want her going out with other men?
__Sheldon And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
__Howard Here's a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.
__Leonard That's all of us. Can I use the laptop?
__Sheldon Why?
__Leonard I have to buy that stupid collector's tin.
__Sheldon Penny.
__Penny Who do we love?
__Sheldon Penny.
__Penny Who do we love?
__Sheldon Penny.
__Penny Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny What's up?
__Sheldon I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
__Penny I'm sorry, what?
__Sheldon A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight.
__Penny God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?
__Sheldon No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
__Penny Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
__Penny All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I'm going with this?
__Sheldon I believe I do.
__Penny Mm.
__Sheldon I'm the guy.
__Penny You're not the guy.
__Sheldon Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.
__Sheldon You tramp.
__Penny Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.
__Sheldon Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?
__Penny Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.
__Amy No, I'm having a nice time.
__Stuart Don't patronize me.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.
__Stuart Hi, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Pardon me. Excuse me.
__Amy Sheldon, what are you doing here?
__Sheldon The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.
__Stuart None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.
__Amy I'm sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.
__Stuart Um, again…
__Sheldon Stuart, please. You're being rude.
__Amy Anything else?
__Sheldon I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
__Amy I'm listening.
__Sheldon With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.
__Amy Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.
__Sheldon You're being impossible.
__Amy Hi, Stuart.
__Sheldon Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Well, that's enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here's a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.
__Amy Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.
__Stuart Oh, you're welcome.
__Sheldon Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Let's wrap things up out there.
__Amy Um, good night, Stuart.
__Stuart Good night.
__Sheldon Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.
__Amy How did you get into my apartment?
__Sheldon Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you're my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
__Amy What's that?
__Sheldon I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.
__Amy It's so romantic.
__Sheldon Mutual indemnification always is. Why don't you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.
__Amy Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand- Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive.
__Sheldon Feel free to retain a lawyer.
__Penny Yeah, I heard you. I got red.
__Amy Bernadette, left foot yellow.
__Bernadette We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
__Amy That's my boyfriend. It's open!
__Sheldon I got a splinter.
__Amy What do you want me to do about it?
__Sheldon Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.
__Amy I should've gotten a lawyer.
__Bernadette Looks like it's just us playing.  Penny?  Penny, we're out of wine!
__Penny You should probably drive.
__Leonard Yeah, it's “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
__Penny Okay. If you can't get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?
__Sheldon I believe that you're capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
__Leonard You want to hear something weird?
__Penny Sure.
__Sheldon In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Sheldon You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
__Leonard Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.
__Sheldon Oh. I thought it was a game.
__Penny What's yours?
__Leonard There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He's in town and wants to have drinks.
__Sheldon Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.
__Leonard Just do it, 'cause he's not gonna let it go.
__Penny Basketball Pope.
__Sheldon And that's how it's done.
__Penny What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?
__Leonard I don't know.
__Sheldon Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
__Leonard No, that was a different guy.
__Sheldon Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?
__Leonard No, that was a different, different guy.
__Sheldon Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?
__Leonard No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister.
__Penny All right, well, what do you think he wants?
__Leonard I don't know.
__Sheldon You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.
__Leonard I told you. That was a different guy.
__Penny Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
__Leonard Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
__Sheldon Look at these men. They've managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Sheldon So, what's got you up? Did you have a bad clam?
__Leonard I didn't have clams.
__Sheldon I don't watch you 24 hours a day. I don't know what you do.
__Leonard It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.
__Sheldon Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What's the matter, Saul? You afraid someone's going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?
__Leonard You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I'm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I'm hitting myself.”
__Sheldon Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.
__Penny ‘Cause when I wear it, it's a shirt. So, what's Howard doing tonight?
__Bernadette Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.
__Penny Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.
__Amy When Leonard gets back, I'd love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he'd let me draw a syringe full of his blood?
__Penny Hmm, he's not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it'll just pour out of his nose.
__Bernadette I don't think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.
__Penny Oh, that's awful.
__Bernadette Worst part was, it was too big.
__Amy That's nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.
__Penny Wow. You poor thing.
__Bernadette What about you?
__Penny Oh. I don't know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn't really have bullies.
__Amy Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?
__Penny No, we weren't really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.
__Bernadette Oh, my God, that's awful.
__Penny No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.
__Amy Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
__Penny Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.
__Amy Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?
__Penny What? I was not a bully.
__Bernadette Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.
__Amy Shh. That's how you wind up in a cornfield.
__Leonard No.
__Raj How about that guy? He looks like he'd hate you.
__Leonard You know, I can really do this by myself.
__Howard Hey, we're here to support you, buddy.
__Leonard No, you're not. You're here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.
__Howard You wore underwear? You fool.
__Raj So, have you figured out what you're going to say to him?
__Howard That's quite a list. I can't read your handwriting, what's that word?
__Leonard Scrotum.
__Leonard Uh, stapled.
__Jimmy Leonard.
__Leonard Oh, hi.
__Jimmy Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.
__Leonard Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
__Jimmy Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you're a big-time scientist now.
__Sheldon And there's the first zinger. Ouch.
__Leonard I'm doing okay, I guess.
__Jimmy Okay? Come on, I read online you're a physicist at a university, you won some medal.
__Leonard The Newcomb medal.
__Jimmy Yeah, congratulations.
__Sheldon Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That's the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.
__Jimmy From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.
__Sheldon Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?
__Raj Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.
__Jimmy You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?
__Leonard Oh, I can't take all the credit. You helped a lot.
__Jimmy Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.
__Howard Like the Black Death and Europe.
__Leonard Jimmy, I'm kind of curious why you wanted to see me.
__Jimmy Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.
__Sheldon Technically, Howard's the gear head. Leonard's just a dime store laser jockey.
__Jimmy This is just between us, right?
__Leonard Right.
__Jimmy Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?
__Raj That sounds amazing. First movie I'm watching, Annie.
__Howard How exactly would these glasses work?
__Jimmy How the hell should I know? That's why I need a nerd.
__Leonard I don't think something like that's even possible.
__Jimmy Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You're like the smartest guy I've ever known.
__Sheldon The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can't live in fear of this man forever.
__Leonard Sheldon, I got this.
__Sheldon You clearly don't. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you're a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you're a mess.
__Jimmy I don't understand.
__Leonard I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
__Sheldon A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey's Kisses to your nipples.
__Raj That's funny because those aren't the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
__Jimmy What is that?
__Sheldon This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
__Leonard 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.
__Jimmy What's this word?
__Leonard Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
__Sheldon You really need to work on your penmanship.
__Jimmy Oh, man, I, I don't know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.
__Leonard It wasn't fun for me.
__Sheldon You're being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.
__Leonard Come on, guys.
__Raj That was pretty badass, dude.
__Sheldon I help the weak. It's yet another way I'm exactly like Batman.
__Leonard Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.
__Bernadette You're doing great.
__Penny Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.
__Amy I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they'd melt.
__Bernadette Penny, it doesn't matter what you did in the past. You're a good person now.
__Penny That's easy for you to say. You weren't just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
__Amy Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word's tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?
__Penny Both.
__Bernadette You'll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
__Penny I actually knew that.
__Amy I never doubted you.
__Penny Ooh, I can't do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?
__Amy There's Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.
__Penny Okay, come on, I don't even have my own house, I'm going to build one for someone else?
__Amy How about donating some of your clothes?
__Penny Oh, my God, that's perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don't wear, and they're just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.
__Bernadette What about helping people?
__Penny And helping people.
__Sheldon Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?
__Leonard You got one for good luck.  I'll get it.
__Sheldon One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
__Jimmy Hey.
__Leonard What are you doing here?
__Jimmy I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls' locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What's this word?
__Leonard Laxative.
__Jimmy Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.
__Leonard Really?
__Jimmy Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.
__Leonard Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.
__Jimmy You're a beautiful guy.
__Leonard Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.
__Jimmy Okay, I got to go.
__Leonard Are you okay to drive?
__Jimmy Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.
__Leonard No, no, no, come on in. I'll make you a cup of coffee.
__Jimmy I wouldn't be imposing?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Sheldon, we can't let him drive.
__Sheldon Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
__Leonard You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
__Jimmy Not really, no. It's funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we're reversed. You're the winner.
__Sheldon You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
__Jimmy You mind if I use your bathroom?
__Leonard Yeah, just back there.
__Howard How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.
__Leonard Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
__Sheldon You know what would be nice?
__Raj What's that?
__Sheldon As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who've tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he's asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn't say we should do it.
__Bernadette I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.
__Penny Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn't down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.
__Bernadette Donated.
__Penny Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.
__Bernadette Penny.
__Penny Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!
__Amy I don't think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.
__Leonard What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
__Sheldon You're soft. This world's going to chew you up and spit you out.
__Jimmy When did I have tacos?
__Leonard Morning, Jimmy.
__Sheldon Oh, there it is, tacos.
__Jimmy Man, I tied one on.
__Leonard Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.
__Jimmy What apology?
__Jimmy Geez, you're still harping on that? What a puss.
__Jimmy It's good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.
__Sheldon I'm not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.
__Leonard I might kill him right now.
__Leonard Okay, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.
__Jimmy Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.
__Leonard No, you're done. I want you out of my apartment right now.
__Sheldon Well said, Boy Wonder.
__Jimmy Or what?
__Sheldon Don't answer that. It's a trick question. I speak from experience.
__Leonard I'm not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out!  Uh-oh.
__Penny Then sit in the car and keep it running.
__Amy You were right, a whole new load.
__Penny Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.
__Amy Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.
__Bernadette God, they're cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?
__Penny Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.
__Amy What is it, the fuzz?
__Penny Look at us. What are we doing?
__Amy I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don't know about Bernadette.
__Penny You know, this is wrong. Let's put everything back. Here.
__Bernadette It's okay, I serve soup to poor people!
__Leonard Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
__Raj Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.
__Leonard Sheldon, he's just practising for his cousin's birthday party.
__Howard As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila.
__Raj I'm telling you, dude, there's a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.
__Sheldon This is how you're going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
__Howard How is this lying?
__Sheldon A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You've chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
__Raj Can't you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?
__Sheldon If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.
__Leonard Sheldon, he's just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don't think they're gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.
__Howard Don't be so hard on him. It's natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
__Sheldon Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.
__Howard How is that not amusing?
__Sheldon It's still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security.
__Howard Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.
__Leonard Next time, you should open with that.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?
__Penny So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?
__Amy Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.
__Penny That is so hot.
__Sheldon All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?
__Amy How was your day?
__Sheldon Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.
__Sheldon Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.
__Amy That's nice. Anyway, I've been dreaming of this day for a long time.
__Sheldon Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I'm not gonna lie, feels pretty good.
__Amy Sheldon, I'm the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.
__Sheldon Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air's getting a bit thin up here.
__Penny So, are we ready to order?
__Amy Give me a minute. I'm gonna go wash up.
__Sheldon Well, that's odd. We both washed up when we came in. It's probably a euphemism for urination.
__Penny Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
__Sheldon Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don't know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.
__Penny Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
__Sheldon Oh, I see why you're confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you're forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That's all about yucky, squishy things.
__Penny Honey, she's upset. You're her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she's excited by.
__Sheldon What if they simply don't excite me?
__Penny Well, just smile and think about koalas.
__Sheldon She'd see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it's this.
__Howard Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
__Bernadette Did it work?
__Howard Ah, let's just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.
__Bernadette Ooh. I like the fabric. Where'd she get it?
__Howard Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.
__Mrs Wolowitz Has she tried on the vest yet?
__Howard I just gave it to her!
__Mrs Wolowitz I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She's short and stacked, like me!
__Howard She's not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!
__Bernadette Listen, Howie, maybe I'm not the best choice to be a magician's assistant.
__Howard You'll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.
__Bernadette You know, i-it's just that I'm not that comfortable with little kids.
__Howard Well, that's because you haven't been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?
__Bernadette Mmm, yeah, sure.
__Howard Oh-ho-ho! I haven't seen this trick in years. It's called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there's a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don't look in there.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard How come you're not doing a mission? You're just wandering around.
__Sheldon Had a rough night. I thought I'd go for a walk and clear my head.
__Leonard Some people go outside and do that.
__Sheldon It's after nine o'clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.
__Leonard You want to talk about it?
__Sheldon No. I think I'll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
__Leonard You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What's going on?
__Sheldon Hard as this may be to believe, it's possible that I'm not boyfriend material.
__Leonard Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
__Sheldon Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I'm gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
__Leonard No, I can't. I'm playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I'm no expert in women.
__Sheldon I'll say.
__Leonard That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. It's the alcohol talking. Go on.
__Leonard Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
__Sheldon Nuts to that. What else you got?
__Leonard Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
__Sheldon Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.
__Leonard Glad I could help.
__Sheldon It's appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favour.
__Bernadette Oh, ah, right.  And now, the great Howdini's next miraculous illusion.
__Child When are we gonna have cake?
__Bernadette After you've been thoroughly amazed.
__Child But we want cake now.
__Howard Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.
__Second child I know how you do that trick.
__Bernadette Do you know how to pipe down?
__Howard Okay, we're going to roll up this newspaper.
__Second child It's a fake pitcher.
__Bernadette You got wax in your ears? The man said it's an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.
__Howard Okay, we're going to stick this in here  and then I'm going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn't bring a change of pants.
__Second child Look, I Googled it. It's a fake pitcher.
__Bernadette That's it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?
__Howard She's just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.
__Bernadette Not him.
__Howard Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.
__Howard Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.
__Bernadette The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.
__Howard Yeah, so?
__Bernadette Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don't want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn't the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let's see how you like this waffle!
__Howard All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we're fine.
__Bernadette I'm sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don't like children.
__Howard Yeah, no, we all got that. But don't you think it'll be different when the child is ours?
__Bernadette Right, when it's our kid that's ruined my body and kept me up all night and I've got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that'll be completely different.
__Howard Well, yeah.
__Sheldon Ooh, a pocket watch.
__Penny Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.
__Sheldon No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.
__Penny Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?
__Sheldon Well, she's very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?
__Assistant Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?
__Penny Trust me, we are not a couple.
__Sheldon Excuse me. I don't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You'd be lucky to land a fella like me.
__Penny Fine, go ahead.
__Sheldon Trust me, we are not a couple.
__Penny He's in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.
__Assistant Great, trouble with girlfriends is what's putting my daughter through USC.
__Penny Ooh, are these real diamonds?
__Assistant Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.
__Sheldon Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you've got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.
__Assistant Actually, that's only 750. Everything's on sale.
__Sheldon Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
__Raj Oh, me, too. You're so caring. I've often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.
__Leonard There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj'll have your babies, problem solved.
__Raj Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn't mean he's displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn't want kids?
__Howard Yeah, she doesn't like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.
__Leonard What are you gonna do?
__Howard I don't know. I can't see a life where I don't have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.
__Leonard You know, there's no guarantee even if you have kids that you're going to like them.
__Raj Wow, that's rough. Where'd you get that?
__Leonard It's right off the dust jacket of my mom's last book.
__Howard Maybe me and Bernadette aren't right for each other.
__Leonard Look, Howard, I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.
__Howard I don't want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.
__Raj What's your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
__Howard Huh, it'll kill her. On the other hand, if I don't give her grandchildren, that'll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I'm golden.
__Penny Eight o'clock.  Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.
__Sheldon Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
__Penny I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?
__Sheldon Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might've gotten suspicious.
__Amy Hey.
__Penny Hi.
__Amy What's he doing here?
__Penny Okay, he wants to talk to you.
__Amy Well, I don't want to talk to him. And I'm pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won't last.
__Penny Sheldon, you're up.
__Sheldon Thank you. Amy, I'd like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I'm proud of you.
__Amy We both know that's your koala face.
__Sheldon I told you.
__Penny Okay, look, he bought you this.
__Amy Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It's a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.
__Penny You look beautiful.
__Amy Of course I do, I'm a princess, and this is my tiara!
__Sheldon You're right, the tiara was too much.
__Bernadette Here's your vest back.
__Howard You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.
__Bernadette Where?
__Howard I don't know, hunting?
__Mrs Wolowitz Don't forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don't get grandkids!
__Howard Don't worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!
__Bernadette I guess you talked to your mom, huh?
__Howard I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn't burn your eyes.
__Bernadette Look, it's obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.
__Bernadette Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?
__Howard Me?
__Bernadette Yeah. You know, you'll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I'll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.
__Howard Yeah.
__Bernadette Yay, so we're good.
__Howard Yeah, we're good.
__Bernadette You know, I don't know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?
__Howard I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it's a condom.
__Sheldon You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
__Leonard Okay, let's talk about that.
__Sheldon As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it's slow outside. I love my mind.
__Leonard We all do. Now, how about dinner?
__Sheldon Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them, they'll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.
__Leonard Leonard (seeing Penny's door open and the girls inside): Excuse me.
__Sheldon Permission granted, Commander.
__Amy Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.
__Leonard Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?
__Penny Why, you guys going somewhere?
__Penny You mean, like a date?
__Leonard Not like a date, a date.
__Amy Ooh!
__Bernadette Ooh!
__Penny Um, o-okay. Sure.
__Amy Ooh!
__Bernadette Ooh!
__Sheldon Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
__Penny Just a sec.  Too much?
__Bernadette Yes.
__Amy No.
__Penny Okay, just hang on.
__Amy You just can't handle her raw sexuality, can you?
__Bernadette When did you and Leonard break up?
__Penny Uh, about two years ago.
__Bernadette Why do you think he asked you out again?
__Penny I don't know.
__Amy Maybe he's dying. That would be so romantic.
__Penny He's not dying.
__Amy Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.
__Penny How about this?
__Bernadette Maybe.
__Amy Come on.
__Penny Yeah, okay, no.
__Bernadette Do you think you'll sleep with him tonight?
__Penny Absolutely not. Look, we're just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.
__Amy If he were dying, would you sleep with him?
__Penny What?
__Amy Assuming he were dying of something that couldn't be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.
__Penny Okay, he is not dying.
__Bernadette You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I'm a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I'm not in his HMO network.
__Penny Screw it. I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. It's just dinner.
__Amy With a dead man.
__Penny Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I'm so nervous.
__Bernadette Relax. You know Leonard's always been crazy about you. It's gonna be great.
__Penny I know, but we've finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?
__Amy Guess it'll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.
__Bernadette Sure, we'd love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.
__Leonard Okay, how do I look?
__Howard Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Raj Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
__Leonard I didn't defile your sister, we had a relationship.
__Raj I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that's defilement.
__Sheldon You want to know my opinion?
__Leonard Oh, boy, do I?
__Sheldon Sarcasm?
__Howard No.
__Sheldon All right, then. The reason you're fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.
__Leonard Where on earth did you get that from?
__Sheldon It's in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.
__Leonard That doesn't make it true.
__Sheldon It's called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.
__Leonard See you later.
__Raj If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard's mother? Sandra Bullock.
__Howard Why?
__Raj Because she's great in everything.
__Penny Oh, that's a good question. How about awkward?
__Leonard Yeah, that sounds right.
__Penny Yeah?
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard So, Polly, tell me about yourself.
__Penny It's Penny.
__Leonard Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.
__Penny Okay, uh, let's see. I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I've done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.
__Leonard Uh, let's see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.
__Penny Wow. Can they?
__Leonard Oh, God, no. The money's pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.
__Penny Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?
__Leonard Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.
__Penny What does that mean?
__Leonard Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don't help them set up their printer.
__Penny You are so funny.
__Leonard Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
__Penny Leonard, this is nice. I'm so glad we did this.
__Leonard Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?
__Penny Whoa. Not so fast.
__Leonard I'm sorry, what did I say?
__Penny Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.
__Leonard Oh, God.
__Penny What?
__Leonard You said always. You'll always have feelings for me.
__Penny So?
__Leonard So, that sounds more like something you'd say if you didn't want a relationship with someone. This isn't working out, but I'll always have feelings for you. I'm sorry I slept with your best friend, but I'll always have feelings for you. Here's the thing, Lisa, I'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you.
__Penny How would you say it?
__Leonard I have feelings for you.
__Penny It's the same thing.
__Leonard No, it's not. Always made it worse.
__Penny You're overthinking this.
__Leonard No, I'm not.
__Penny Yes, you are. You always overthink things.
__Leonard Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
__Penny See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.
__Leonard Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.
__Penny Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for.
__Leonard Wait, if you guys didn't talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.
__Raj He's got to be doing this on purpose.
__Howard Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?
__Leonard You're thirty years old and you live with your mother.
__Raj I guess it didn't go well.
__Sheldon We don't know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.
__Howard How about now?
__Sheldon Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he's being murdered. Now, back to our game.
__Raj You were in the middle of an erection.
__Sheldon Oh, of course. It's right here in my hand.
__Penny Do not overthink this.
__Leonard I don't understand.
__Penny Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
__Leonard Okay, but earlier it seemed like…
__Penny No talking.
__Leonard Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.
__Penny You hung in there, though.
__Leonard Well, there was a lot at stake.
__Penny So what do you want to do now?
__Leonard Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?
__Penny I don't know, it's complicated.
__Leonard Well, I'm a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.
__Penny Okay, it's just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.
__Leonard Why? What are you afraid of?
__Penny Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?
__Leonard What if I dump you?
__Penny Come on, be serious.
__Leonard Well, how about if we don't think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it's solid, then we'll roll it out to the public.
__Penny So we don't tell people we're back together?
__Leonard Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
__Penny Well, we don't really have to pretend.
__Leonard And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything's cool.
__Penny Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.
__Leonard I can't believe you kept this.
__Penny Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn't.
__Leonard That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you how much this means to me.
__Leonard Yeah, hi, hi. How's it going?
__Sheldon Uh, can't complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o'clock in the morning?
__Leonard Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?
__Sheldon I was using the bathroom.
__Leonard Yeah, well, so was I.
__Sheldon Really? I didn't see you in there.
__Leonard Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.
__Leonard The, the gas station across the street.
__Sheldon In your pyjamas?
__Sheldon Without shoes?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon On a cold winter's night?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
__Leonard Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.
__Sheldon Well, then, I guess it's plausible. Hang on a second, mister.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon It's customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Here's two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
__Leonard I don't want beef jerky.
__Sheldon It's not about you. It's about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.
__Leonard Fine.
__Howard Why?
__Sheldon We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I'd be obligated to do so.
__Bernadette I'm so disappointed it didn't work with him and Penny.
__Amy Me, too. Out of deference to them, let's not flaunt our happy relationship.
__Sheldon You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Leonard We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
__Sheldon Well, I doubt they'd want to talk about that, so we're fine.
__Howard I'm surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.
__Leonard Well, hey, we're grown-ups. We can still be friends.
__Bernadette Boy, I don't know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.
__Howard Why not?
__Bernadette I'm a very vengeful person.
__Howard Really?
__Bernadette With access to weaponised smallpox.
__Penny Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?
__Howard Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he's not gonna get it from you.
__Leonard Yeah, it's all good. We-We'll always have feelings for each other.
__Bernadette Oh, that's nice.
__Leonard See, she knew what always meant.
__Penny Wow, you're like a dog with a bone, aren't you?
__Leonard I'm just making a point.
__Penny Is the point that you don't know when to let something go?
__Sheldon People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I'd like to place my order.
__Penny Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can't be together? Because you always have to be right.
__Leonard Oh, that is not true.
__Sheldon I've got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
__Penny You know what? I just realized I'm on a break. I'll get someone else.
__Leonard Well…
__Sheldon Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.
__Penny Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
__Leonard Well, I was trying to act like we weren't seeing each other. That was the plan, right?
__Penny No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That's a little hard to do when you're always being such a tool bag.
__Leonard You know what? I don't have to stand here and take this crap. (Goes to Penny's apartment.)
__Penny The hell do you think you're going?
__Leonard Isn't sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
__Penny Yeah, kind of, yeah.
__Penny What do you mean?
__Leonard Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
__Penny That's because you overthink everything.
__Sheldon's voice Sheldon' Leonard, are you listening to me?
__Leonard What? Yeah.
__Sheldon This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
__Leonard I don't know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.
__Sheldon You're right, I'll give him a shot.
__Leonard Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?
__Penny Why, you guys going somewhere?
__Leonard No, I mean just you and me.
__Amy Ooh!
__Bernadette Ooh!
__Penny Uh, have you thought this through?
__Sheldon No, can't do it. Sorry, Quinto, you're going back.
__Bernadette What about me and Howard?
__Amy Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.
__Bernadette Where are you guys going to eat?
__Amy Penny?
__ Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?
__Penny Well, it's a little late for me to start saying no, isn't it?
__ Penny?
__Penny Sorry, just remembered I've got to stop by the drugstore.
__Amy Hang on, Dr. C. What's vexillology?
__Sheldon Vexillology is the study of flags.
__Amy Cool. I think I just learned something.
__Sheldon Did you have fun doing it?
__Amy I'll say.
__Sheldon Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we'll answer some burning questions. What's the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.
__Amy Sweet!
__Sheldon Why are you waving a white flag?
__Amy I'm surrendering to fun.
__Sheldon Now, today' you gotta know how to hold 'em, you gotta know how to fold 'em. Let's start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it's used to…
__Leonard Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.
__Sheldon Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?
__Leonard Sorry. I'm having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
__Sheldon And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
__Amy You okay?
__Sheldon No, I'm a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I'm still here. And, take two. Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
__Amy Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What's vexillology?
__Sheldon Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
__Amy It's Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
__Sheldon Confound it! You're right, it's brilliant. Let's take it from the top.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Me, too, I missed you.
__Penny You see me all the time. You sure you just don't miss the sex?
__Leonard Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?
__Penny I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we're gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.
__Leonard Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn't know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.
__Penny Okay, well, maybe not that slow.
__Leonard How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?
__Penny You know, just for fun, let's say I'm not.
__Leonard Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.
__Penny You mean like a beta test?
__Leonard Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren't involved in the development of the appli…
__Penny Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?
__Leonard No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That's our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.
__Penny All right. Let's give it a shot.
__Leonard Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list. At some point, we'll exchange.
__Penny Okay. Good night, Leonard.
__Leonard Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I'm back.
__Sheldon Cut! Take 47.
__Raj I will take that action.
__Sheldon The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn't discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.
__Howard Let's see the new phone.
__Raj I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?
__Howard Really? Me? That's, like, the best part.
__Raj Grab a corner. Whoa, what's your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.
__Howard Oh, yeah.
__Sheldon Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.
__Howard Oh, let me try the voice recognition.
__Raj Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don't get greedy.  Hello?
__Phone Hello.
__Raj What's your name?
__Phone My name is Siri.
__Howard Look at that. There's finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
__Raj Are you single?
__Siri I don't have a marital status, if that's what you're asking.
__Raj Yeah, you're right, that's too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?
__Siri I've found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.
__Raj I will see you gentlemen later.
__Howard She is gonna break his heart.
__Sheldon Careful, it's that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year's Who Con.
__Penny Uh, we're not counting this as a date, are we?
__Leonard Um, I'm not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.
__Penny When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV.
__Leonard Even Doctor Who?
__Penny Even Doctor Who.
__Sheldon All right, that's it. Who Con, you're out.
__Penny Well, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.
__Leonard Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.
__Penny What's this?
__Leonard My bug report to you.
__Penny Well, that's quite a list you got there.
__Leonard It's colour coded.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There's a key down here at the bottom. It's neat, huh?
__Penny Yep.
__Leonard So, have a good night.
__Penny Yep.
__Leonard Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.
__Amy What's baffling me is what you could've possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
__Sheldon How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
__Amy Her heart's full of love, no one cares what's in her mouth.
__Siri I am well.
__Raj What are you doing right now?
__Siri What am I doing? I'm talking with you.
__Raj You have a beautiful voice.
__Siri Thank you, it's nice to be appreciated.
__Raj I bet it is. Why don't women like me?
__Siri Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don't women like me?”
__Raj No need. I've already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?
__Siri My name is Siri.
__Raj Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.
__Siri Would you like me to call you Raj?
__Raj I'd like you to call me sexy.
__Siri From now on, I'll call you sexy. Okay?
__Raj Okay.
__ I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.
__Raj Thank you, darling.
__Siri You are most certainly welcome, sexy.
__Sheldon Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.
__Raj I'm sorry?
__Sheldon You've taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
__Raj I haven't bonded with it.
__Sheldon Oh, no, of course. I understand. You're afraid the world isn't ready for your taboo love. Your secret's safe with me.
__Raj It's just a phone.
__Barry Kripke Cooper.
__Sheldon Kripke.
__Barry Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we're going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o'cwock, pot wuck.
__Raj Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.
__Siri All right, I'll remind you.
__Barry You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?
__Barry's Siri Barry' I'm sorry, Bawwy. I don't understand wecommend a westauwant.
__Barry Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.
__Barry's Siri Barry' I don't know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.
__Barry See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.
__Raj Hey, don't talk to her like that. She's a lady.
__Barry Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.
__Leonard Hey. You ready to go?
__Penny Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.
__Leonard Can you finish it later?
__Penny No, I can't. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we'd have more fun things to talk about if I read more.
__Penny Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
__Leonard They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don't they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don't get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I've addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It's kind of a surprise.
__Penny All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren't so tall. We wouldn't want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Yeah. Oh. Here's my list for you, right there.
__Leonard All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it's coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I'm sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it's right here.
__Howard Great.
__Howard Yeah, what are we eating?
__Raj Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.
__Bernadette Who's Siri? Is he dating somebody new?
__Howard Yes. His phone.
__Bernadette Oh. Is that cute or creepy?
__Howard Uh-huh.
__Siri Playing smooth jazz.
__Raj Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can't believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.
__Bernadette I don't know if I want to stay.
__Leonard I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
__Penny Okay, you're kind of really great.
__Leonard You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
__Penny Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.
__Leonard Right. Sorry, sorry.
__Penny And stop apologizing all the time.
__Leonard Right. Sorry.
__Penny All right, let's shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?
__Leonard I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
__Penny Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.
__Penny No, you've got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.
__Leonard Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
__Penny Well, thank you for a really cool evening.
__Leonard Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
__Penny Things are looking good.
__Leonard So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don't know how much time I have.
__Penny Good night, you.
__Sheldon Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.
__Amy Und ich bin eine pretzel!
__Sheldon Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…
__Amy Mit…
__Sheldon Flags.
__Raj Thank you. (Enters a door marked “The Office of Siri” Inside is a red-headed woman sitting at a huge console desk.)
__Siri Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you.  Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you'd like to make love to me, just tell me.  I'm sorry. I don't understand.
__Raj No!
__Sheldon Emergency preparedness drill.
__Leonard Oh, no, come on!
__Sheldon Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.
__Leonard I have to get a lock for my door.
__Sheldon I think you'll like the drill tonight. I've tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.
__Leonard Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.
__Sheldon Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?
__Leonard Fine.
__Sheldon All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.
__Sheldon You make that joke every three months. I still don't get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?
__Leonard I don't know, what am I doing?
__Sheldon Look around you, there's hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You're going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice.  Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!
__Leonard Aah!
__Sheldon And that's why we wear hard hats.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo' Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova' Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.
__Howard This is going right into my synagogue's newsletter.
__Raj Dude, if you're going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname.
__Howard I don't get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.
__Raj Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.
__Howard Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
__Leonard Because the cafeteria doesn't offer little packets of methamphetamine.
__Howard Emergency drill night last night, huh?
__Leonard Uh-huh.
__Raj How'd you do?
__Sheldon I' not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else's day.
__Leonard You know what, I'm so tired I can't even think straight. I'm going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?
__Sheldon You can't go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o'clock.
__Leonard Oh, can't you take the bus to the dentist?
__Sheldon Of course I can. It's coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that's the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.
__Raj They put you under for a cleaning?
__Sheldon Yeah, they have to, I'm a biter.
__Leonard Whatever, Sheldon. I'm exhausted. I'm not taking you to the dentist.
__Sheldon Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It's right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”
__Leonard You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It's ridiculous. I'm your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.
__Sheldon Well, it has. Ask anybody.
__Leonard I don't care. I'm done.
__Sheldon Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
__Leonard I don't know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.
__Sheldon Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall.  ‘Sup?
__Leonard Where do I sign?
__Sheldon Right here. Use your finger.
__Leonard There. Done.
__Sheldon All right. That's it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.
__Leonard I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.
__Penny What does that mean?
__Bernadette He's gonna learn to poop in space.
__Howard Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
__Raj Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
__Sheldon Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.
__Leonard ‘Sup?
__Sheldon ‘Sup? My apologies. I would've been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.
__Amy I saved you a dumpling.
__Sheldon Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.
__Amy I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy. I'm right in the middle of my addiction study. I've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow's the day we switch them to O'Doul's.
__Sheldon You're my girlfriend and you're not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where'd the magic go?
__Penny Sheldon, that's not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don't use them for what they're for, so what do I know?
__Bernadette Howard doesn't make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
__Sheldon Well, if Amy's too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You're Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here's a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?
__Raj Their meatballs are pretty good.
__Sheldon What's that?
__Raj Nothing, nothing.
__Stuart Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?
__Sheldon No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.
__Stuart Ninth?
__Sheldon You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?
__Stuart Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.
__Sheldon Great. Great. So, what's new with your family? How's your mother? Is she alive?
__Stuart Yeah.
__Sheldon And your father? Alive?
__Stuart Yes.
__Sheldon How about your grandparents, they alive?
__Stuart No.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?
__Stuart I'm sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?
__Sheldon Yes. And now, I can't make any promises, but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.
__Stuart Sheldon, I'm working. I can't take you to the dentist. Also, and I can't stress this enough, I don't want to take you to the dentist.
__Sheldon Can't help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.
__Howard You can't do Buzz. Buzz is taken.
__Raj Buzz Lightyear is not real.
__Howard No, that's not what I'm talking about.
__Raj Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?
__Howard No.
__Raj Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz.
__Howard Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.
__Raj All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?
__Leonard That's not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz.
__Howard Yeah, it's great, but I told you, I don't get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.
__Raj Maybe there's a way to get them to come up with it.
__Howard Like how?
__Leonard Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.
__Howard Did it work?
__Leonard No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.
__Raj Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I'll call you and they'll hear it. Plant the seed.
__Howard That's actually not a terrible plan.
__Raj They don't call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
__Leonard ‘Sup?
__Leonard Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?
__Sheldon Not necessary. No. I found a service that'll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.
__Leonard All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.
__Sheldon Are you suggesting that you've come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
__Leonard Absolutely. If you admit that you're a 30-year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own.
__Sheldon I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you'll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.
__Leonard Why is that good?
__Penny Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.
__Sheldon Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.
__Leonard What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
__Sheldon Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it's too bad you're no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It's not for you.
__Leonard It's just a blackout, I'm sure the power will be back on soon.
__Sheldon And I'm sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
__Penny You know, I got some candles in my apartment.
__Sheldon But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That's a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.
__Leonard You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let's go.
__Sheldon Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you're willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.
__Penny I've got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
__Sheldon Oh, he'll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he's gonna be bored out of his mind.
__Penny You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?
__Leonard I thought because our relationship's in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.
__Penny Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
__Leonard I can go so slow it'll be like there's a snail in your mouth.
__Penny Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there's nothing else to do right now.
__Sheldon Excuse me, Leonard.
__Leonard Since when don't you knock? It's like the only good thing about you.
__Sheldon Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We're in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.
__Leonard Fine, what is it?
__Sheldon I'm making s'mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
__Leonard S'mores, huh? Good for you.
__Sheldon Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.
__Sheldon Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s'more by myself. And then I'm gonna have s'more. By myself.
__Penny Aw.
__Leonard No, don't aw him. He brought this all on himself.
__Penny But he's sad.
__Leonard No, he's crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it'll suck you back in.
__Penny I think he misses his little buddy.
__Leonard Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.
__Sheldon This is a Bunsen burner. I'm a scientist, I know what I'm doing. Oh, drat. (His s'more is on fire. He dunks it in a glass of water.) Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.
__Sheldon What are you proposing?
__Leonard That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.
__Sheldon And how would I do that?
__Sheldon Every time?
__Sheldon Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother's Day or Father's Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard's Day.
__Leonard I kind of like the sound of that.
__Sheldon Of course you do. It's about you, like everything else.  Oh, thank goodness. I don't think I had it in me to make another glass of water.
__Leonard So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Can I sit in your spot?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Can I control the thermostat?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Do I get a card?
__Sheldon Of course you get a card. It's Leonard's Day.
__Penny Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.
__Sheldon Oh, I don't know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard's Day.
__Penny Leonard's Day?
__Sheldon Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you're good.
__Raj Oh, yeah. There's a reason he's Sir Elton John. They don't make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?
__Howard Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don't bother me!
__Mrs Wolowitz Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.
__Howard Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning.
__NASA Guy Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early.
__Howard No problem, Dr. Massimino.
__Dr Massimino The guys here call me Mass.
__Howard Mass. That's a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration.
__Mass Yeah. It's just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the…
__Howard Sorry. My phone.
__Mass What is that? Is that Rocket Man?
__Howard Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!
__Howard Not now!
__Mass Who's that?
__Howard My mom. Sorry.
__Howard No problem, Fruit Loops.
__Leonard Five.
__Sheldon Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
__Howard E.
__Sheldon And a funny Greek letter.
__Raj Gamma.
__Sheldon I said funny.
__Raj Upsilon?
__Sheldon Good one. And an electrical charge.
__Leonard Positive.
__Sheldon Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a  Okay. No, no. I'll start over. Professor
__Howard I haven't seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
__Sheldon Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn't.
__Leonard It's not funny. That mistake got published.
__Sheldon Stop! I'm going to wet myself!
__Howard I wonder what he wants.
__Leonard Doesn't look happy, so I'm guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.
__Seibert Dr. Cooper?
__Leonard Told ya.
__Sheldon Oh, President Siebert, I assume you'd like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.
__Seibert No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.
__Sheldon You don't like written suggestions. You don't like when I give them to you while we're urinating in the men's room. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.
__Seibert Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you're refusing to take your vacation.
__Sheldon I don't need a vacation.
__Seibert You're obligated to take one. And I'd also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I'll see you all on Monday, except for you.
__Sheldon But if I don't come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?
__Seibert Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.
__Sheldon Sarcasm?
__Howard No. You should go.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!
__Leonard What the hell are you doing?
__Sheldon Bleeding from my ears.
__Leonard What are you doing hiding back there?
__Sheldon I'm sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what's under the blanket, you tell him it's some lobster traps.
__Leonard Lobster traps?
__Sheldon Yes. That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
__Leonard What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
__Sheldon Will they, Leonard? (Puts on cap and long-hair wig)
__Leonard Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I'll drive you there.
__Sheldon And no more singing.
__Leonard Fine.
__Sheldon I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
__Bernadette Turn it over. I'm hoping my relatives think it's Hebrew.
__Amy This is really happening. I'm gonna be a maid of honour. I'm gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.
__Bernadette You mean my special day?
__Amy They're gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody's head.
__Bernadette If I ever actually ever get married.
__Penny Why wouldn't you?
__Penny Ouch.
__Bernadette Yeah. Howie's gonna freak out.
__Amy Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.
__Bernadette I just don't know how I'm gonna break it to him.
__Penny You know, I'm a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you're in bed with him. That's how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That's how I told his brother the same thing.
__Bernadette I don't know, I don't want to manipulate him with sex.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, that's what sex is for.
__Amy You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride's father. For example, you're adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose.  You would fetch a unicorn.
__Sheldon Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.
__Howard How about Florida? They've got Cape Canaveral, they've got Disney, they've got my Aunt Ida and the world's largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.
__Sheldon My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.
__Raj You know, if I had a week off, I'd go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you'll feel like you were born without bones.
__Howard I don't think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.
__Raj Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
__Sheldon It's like I'm living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.
__Howard I don't think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
__Leonard Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.
__Sheldon One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend's biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.
__Howard Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.
__Sheldon Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy's a biologist. I'll go work in her lab.
__Howard Isn't that just Feynman's idea?
__Sheldon Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you're an expert.
__Penny Hey, you.
__Leonard Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.
__Penny Yeah, I didn't have any quarters, so I've been sneaking stuff into other people's loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?
__Leonard It doesn't matter what I say, you're gonna tell me anyway.
__Penny What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
__Leonard Wow. That's rough.
__Penny So you're saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn't sign a pre-nup?
__Leonard Absolutely not. If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you're on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?
__Penny I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn't leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.
__Leonard Joke all you want, but you think about it.
__Penny Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.
__Amy I'm excited to work with my boyfriend. It's gonna be romantic.
__Sheldon Way to kill the mood.
__Amy Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that's the love story Disney should tell.
__Sheldon Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse's back? Ha-ha, I'm a freak!
__Amy Oh, I'm gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.
__Sheldon Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I'd better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?
__Amy No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.
__Sheldon What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You're gonna make him do the dishes? That's like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.
__Amy Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.
__Sheldon I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it's still alive. Let's do this.
__Raj No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where's the other white guy?
__Leonard I'm sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?
__Raj Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.
__Leonard Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
__Raj Oh, that's a shame, he's gonna be devastated.
__Leonard I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
__Raj Hmm. I'm gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor's handing out roses. Follow your heart.
__Howard Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.
__Leonard Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.
__Howard I know, it's not on my wedding diet. I don't care.
__Leonard Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.
__Howard A pre-nup? Wow.
__Howard I don't know.
__Raj Follow your heart.
__Howard You know what, it's not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It's completely reasonable.
__ Leonard; Good. That's a healthy attitude.
__ Yeah, actually, it's good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.
__Raj Like what?
__Howard I've got some rare comic books. The Vespa's almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three's Company.
__Raj Mr. Roper's dead? You can't just spring that on a guy.
__Amy Soap spots. Wash 'em again.
__Sheldon Y-you're being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.
__Amy Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it's, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.
__Sheldon Biologists are mean.
__ All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.
__Sheldon There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
__Amy I'm sure it was.
__Sheldon I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
__Sheldon You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
__ Later.
__ 366… 367…
__Amy How's it going?
__Sheldon How's counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.
__Amy Great.
__Sheldon Aw, nuts! One…
__ Later.
__ This is preposterous. I think you're giving me these tasks because you're afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I'll show you up.
__Amy Really? Is that what you think?
__Sheldon Yes, that's what I think. And I'm super smart, so it's probably true.
__Amy Hey, I've been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You've been here for three hours, and you've spent one of them in the bathroom.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
__Amy Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right.
__Sheldon Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged. It's the same reason Einstein failed math.
__Amy Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
__Sheldon You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they'd offer to toast it for me, too.
__Sheldon All right. I'm no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.
__Amy You're getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It's the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you.
__Sheldon It's not. I'll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.
__Amy Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
__Sheldon No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
__Amy No. But your thumb does.
__Sheldon Oh, dear.
__Amy Yeah, you're a biologist.
__Sheldon I'm on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
__Howard What happened to your thumb?
__Sheldon You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we'll be here all day, let's just move on.
__Barman What can I get you?
__Sheldon Ah, seeing as I'm on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don't let me have too many of those.
__Howard We're grown men, we drink at bars.
__Penny No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
__Howard Oh, yeah, sure.
__Penny You and Amy? Good?
__Sheldon Oh, better than good.
__Penny You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
__Howard I'm not signing a pre-nup.
__Penny All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.
__Sheldon Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound.
__Amy What do you want?
__Sheldon I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.
__Amy Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
__Sheldon I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
__Amy That's not an apology.
__Sheldon That is your opinion.
__Amy I want a real apology.
__Sheldon I'm sorry that you weren't able to…
__Amy No.
__Sheldon That my genius…
__Amy No.
__Sheldon That the soap was…
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon Fine. Sorry.
__Amy You're forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They're still dirty from yesterday.
__Sheldon Next year I'm going to Epcot.
__Howard No. I'm not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn't have to hear it through the nerd-vine.
__Bernadette So, what are we gonna do?
__Howard You really want me to sign a pre-nup?
__Bernadette I don't know. My dad's pretty insistent on it, though.
__Howard Why don't I talk to your dad, man-to-man?
__Bernadette Really? Oh, that'd be so great.
__Howard Done.
__Bernadette I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he's retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don't worry, he won't shoot it. It's more of a fashion statement.
__Howard Okay.
__Bernadette And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don't bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you're Jewish.
__Howard Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?
__Bernadette So the thing to watch for, if he's shouting at you, you're okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.
__Howard You know, this isn't that pressing. Why don't I talk to him about it in May.
__Howard They've got a phone.
__Howard I guess. Still, it's a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.
__Leonard What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
__Howard I wonder how long Sheldon's got.
__Sheldon These shrimp are all the same size. There's no the logical order to eat them in.
__Leonard Can't be very long.
__Raj Hey, look, there's Rothman's empty office. Sad.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Mm, indeed.
__Howard So sad.
__Sheldon Dibs.
__Kripke What's up, fewwas?
__Kripke Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.
__Sheldon This is not your office. It hasn't been assigned yet.
__Sheldon Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.
__Leonard You just called dibs.
__Sheldon Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.
__Kripke I awwived at the office first. I'm the pwoverbial earwy bird.
__Rothman Gentlemen.
__All Professor Rothman.
__Rothman Good evening.
__All Good evening.
__Raj I'm glad that men are wearing hats again. They're so distinguished.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.
__Amy What's huge is what you've done for me.
__Penny Oh, no, Amy, I haven't done anything.
__Amy No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I'm like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.
__Penny Okay.
__Amy I wanted to get you something you didn't have.
__Penny Wow. I-I don't know what to s… Wow.
__Amy Do you like it?
__Penny Do I like it? Wow.
__Amy So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?
__Penny Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I'd have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…
__Amy No problem.
__Penny Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.
__Siebert Can't this wait?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. We just need a word.
__Siebert Now? You realize I'm your boss, and I am holding my penis?
__Kripke Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I'm sowwy. This guy's got no wespect for boundawies.
__Siebert What do you want?
__Kripke Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman's office is wightfully mine?
__Siebert Can't you take this up with your department chairman?
__Sheldon We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
__Siebert Gentlemen, there's a task I'm trying to accomplish here, and I'm having trouble doing it.
__Sheldon Oh, my. President Siebert, I don't mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you're interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that'll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.
__Kripke Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I'm sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.
__Sheldon Oh, he's just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.
__Siebert Gentlemen, I'm going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you're both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman's office, I couldn't give the furry crack of a rat's behind.
__Kripke Well, as wong as we're here, I might as well take a weak.
__Sheldon Kripke?
__Kripke Yes?
__Sheldon You're in my spot.
__Penny So big.
__Bernadette And ugly.
__Penny So ugly. What am I gonna do?
__Bernadette I don't know. You can't take it down. You'll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.
__Penny Is there any chance I'll learn to love it?
__Bernadette That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
__Penny All right, it's got to go.
__Bernadette What will you tell Amy?
__Penny How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you're not in it?
__Bernadette Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard's mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I've suffered enough.
__Penny Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.
__Bernadette Mmm, too bad you're not as strong as the dude in the painting.
__Howard It's numbered.
__Raj Ooh, limited edition. Nice.
__Sheldon Oh, that'll be Kripke.
__Leonard What's he doing here?
__Sheldon We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn't work, I'm going to poison his tea.
__Kripke Cooper.
__Sheldon Kripke. Come in. I'm making tea. Would you like a cup?
__Kripke Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don't want tea. Wet's get down to bwass tacks.
__Sheldon Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…
__Kripke We're not fwiends.
__Sheldon Well, that's a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman's office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.
__Kripke How about I take Wothman's office, and you go suck a wemon?
__Sheldon You sure I can't get you that cup of tea?
__Raj How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
__Kripke What the fwig is that?
__All Hail.
__Kripke How does it work?
__Sheldon Oh, it's very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
__Kripke I'm sowwy. Can you wepeat that?
__Sheldon Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
__Kripke Almost got it. One more time.
__Sheldon Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…
__Howard Sheldon, stop. He's screwing with you.
__Sheldon Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I'd smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.
__Howard It's the 21st century. You can't have a duel.
__Leonard H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?
__Sheldon Voyager trivia, or model trains.
__Kripke You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven't watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.
__Leonard It's gonna be hard to find something you're both equally good at.
__Raj Is there anything you're both equally bad at?
__Both Sports.
__Sheldon Five what?
__Leonard Balls in the basket.
__Sheldon Ew!
__ Later. Sheldon dribbling ball, approached Kripke, throws it wildly at a pile of mats in the corner.
__ It's out, wight?
__ Later. Kripke, dribbling ball, watched by Sheldon, dribbles it all the way into the back wall.
__ Time. Wan out of woom.
__Leonard You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
__Raj Yeah.
__Leonard I get it.
__ Later. Kripke chases ball across room chased by Sheldon. Sounds of collision. Sheldon chases ball back across the room chased by Kripke.
__ Later. Ball hits Sheldon in back of head.
__ Hey! He did that on purpose,
__Leonard No, he didn't. Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let's try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.
__Kripke Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.
__Leonard No. No, I'm not.
__Sheldon Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force.  I'm gonna need more force.
__Kripke Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn't come down.) Do I get points for that?
__ Later. A trampoline has been added. Sheldon tries first, ball hits backboard, bounces back in his face. Kripke tries next, with a run up, ends up crashing into the back wall again.
__ Later.
__ All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It's no longer funny. Let's try something else.
__Sheldon What do you propose?
__Leonard Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.
__Kripke Oh, you are going down, Cooper.
__Sheldon I don't think so, Kripke. I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day.
__Leonard All right, that's enough trash talk. One, two, three.
__Howard Sheldon was higher.
__Leonard Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.
__Sheldon Who's unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
__Penny I cannot believe you've never seen Grease.
__Amy My mother didn't allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
__Bernadette I've got to go. I've got to get up early. My company's testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn't shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.
__Amy I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.
__Penny Good night, real Amy.
__Amy You don't have to say good night to painting Amy, 'cause she's never leaving.
__Bernadette Good night, real Penny.
__Penny Bye.
__Bernadette Good night, transvestite Penny.
__Penny Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.
__Amy You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.
__Penny Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It's just going to be my gift to you. Bye.
__Amy Thank you. Wait. Where'd the painting go?
__Penny It's right over there.
__Amy Why?
__Penny I have no idea. That is weird.
__Amy You hate it.
__Penny No. No, no. It's just, it's a little big.
__Amy I feel like an idiot.
__Penny No, come on, you're not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.
__Amy Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don't need your pity.
__Penny Oh, Amy, come on.
__Amy I'm just glad I didn't go for the sculpture.
__Raj I'm happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.
__Sheldon Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.
__Raj Thank you.
__Sheldon Yeah. Call first.
__Rothman Oh. Hello.
__Sheldon Professor Rothman. This isn't your office any more. You're retired.
__Rothman I think the word you're looking for is invisible.
__Amy Don't bother.
__Penny Oh, Amy, please.
__Amy I'm so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.
__Penny I know.
__Amy I was a fool from Summer Lovin' to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
__Penny You're right. You're absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
__Amy Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.
__Penny I don't think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
__Amy I bought you a painting that's 12 square feet in area. There's a number.
__Penny Amy, come on…
__Amy If you don't like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.
__Penny Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don't want to lose you out of my life.
__Amy I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble believing you right now.
__Penny Grab your hammer.
__Amy No. Damage is done.
__Penny Okay, look, I didn't want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.
__Amy Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.
__Penny Yeah, th-th-th-that's what it is, so…
__Amy You have such a good heart.
__Penny Huh, I try.
__Amy Come on.
__Penny Well where are we going?
__Amy We're going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
__Penny Well, what about Bernadette?
__Amy Oh, screw her. She's just lucky we let her hang out with us.
__Sheldon I'm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
__Howard Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?
__Sheldon Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn't in my new office. No. It's next door, in Professor Davenport's office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.
__Leonard Why is there a hole here?
__Sheldon Why is there a hole in my new office? I' There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.
__Raj Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That's nice.
__Sheldon Is it? Listen.
__Raj What, you don't like wind chimes?
__Sheldon No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.
__Howard The bird?
__Sheldon Yeah, It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes.
__Raj So?
__Sheldon You don't get it, do you? That's a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he's out of tune on purpose. He's mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?
__Howard The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
__Sheldon No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they're running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!
__Leonard Sheldon, relax.
__Sheldon How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
__Leonard If you're not happy, why don't you just let Kripke have the office?
__Sheldon What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We're trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!
__Amy Little higher on the right.
__Penny Now?
__Amy Little more. No. That's got it.
__Penny Yeah, okay. That's, uh, that's good.
__Amy I'll let you in on a little secret.
__Penny Yeah, good call.
__Amy But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.
__Penny You're talking about the painting, right?
__Amy Sure.
__Leonard What happened?
__Sheldon I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
__Sheldon It's called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.
__Leonard Hang in there. I'll be right back.
__Sheldon Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.
__Barber Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hello. I'm here for my haircut with Mr. D'Onofrio.
__Barber I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's in the hospital. He's pretty sick.
__Sheldon Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?
__Barber I can cut it for you.
__Sheldon You're not Mr. D'Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio. You believe this guy?
__Leonard Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it. He's a barber.
__Sheldon He's not a barber, he's the nephew. He's an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Sheldon When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.
__Sheldon Yes, there are.
__Leonard Have you ever seen them?
__Sheldon No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn't have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?
__Barber Your what?
__Sheldon To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.
__Leonard Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.
__Sheldon Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it's on you.
__Barber So my kid said the funniest thing today.
__Sheldon Nope.
__Leonard When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Sure. What are you doing?
__Sheldon I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
__Leonard Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.
__Sheldon Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
__Howard Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
__Raj Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.
__Howard Yeah, but it's from NASA, so it's oh eight hundred.
__Raj But it says eight a.m.
__Howard You read it as oh eight hundred.
__Raj It doesn't have an oh in front of it.
__Howard You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut, and you're dying of jealousy.
__Leonard So, what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?
__Sheldon Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don't churn our own butter, we don't, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin' don't get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…
__Leonard Sheldon, be nice.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.
__Raj You could go to my guy. He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they'll massage your scalp. It's about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.
__Howard Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I'm going
__ to astronaut training to Sheldon can't get a haircut?
__ Now who's dying of jealousy? Oh, it's you.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I'm looking for a barber and I'm running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you're quiet, you can hear it.
__Amy What about Supercuts?
__Sheldon I tried once. They do men's and women's hair in the same room at the same time. It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
__Amy Well, this isn't a crisis. Why don't you just let your hair grow out a little?
__Sheldon Why don't I let my hair grow out? Um, why don't I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?
__Amy Well, I don't know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I'm gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.
__Bernadette Hi, sweetie.
__Howard I miss you.
__Bernadette I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day.
__Howard Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.
__Bernadette Cool. How do they do that?
__Howard It's pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it's going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.
__Bernadette You threw up?
__Howard Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there's no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you're screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.
__Bernadette That sounds mean.
__Howard No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn't want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?
__Bernadette Sure, why?
__Sheldon Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?
__Nurse Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?
__Sheldon Oh, no, no, I'm just here to get my hair cut.
__Nurse I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!
__Sheldon I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.
__Leonard Hmm.
__Penny Well, is it or isn't it?
__Leonard You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it's your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.
__Penny Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can't go here because of my lighthouse, and he can't go here because of my pointy-head guy.
__Leonard Like I said, complicated game.
__Penny So did I win or not?
__Leonard Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that's, that-that's what chess is all about.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.
__Sheldon Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?
__Penny Okay, what just happened?
__Leonard I don't know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I'm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.
__Penny Uh, sweetie, are you all right?
__Sheldon No, I'm not all right. It's been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.
__Penny Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.
__Sheldon Leonard, explain it to her.
__Leonard Oh, uh, he's crazy.
__Sheldon I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it's clear now, I've been wasting my time.
__Leonard Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
__Penny You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again. We don't know what's gonna happen.
__Sheldon Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen. But I see your point.
__Leonard I think this could be good for you. Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit.
__Sheldon You're right. I should embrace the chaos.
__Leonard Great. What are you going to do first?
__Sheldon I don't know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I'm going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.
__Leonard I got to tell you, I'm a little worried about him.
__Penny If I were you, I'd be worried that a girl who's never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.
__Bernadette Howie, what happened to you?
__Howard We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.
__Howard Uh-huh. Except you don't have food or water, and they don't have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.
__Bernadette Do you sleep in tents?
__Howard No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.
__Bernadette Poor baby.
__Howard But I did it. I survived. I wasn't sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.
__Bernadette You're so brave. I'm proud of you.
__Howard I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.
__Bernadette Are you crying?
__Howard No, I don't think it's possible. I'm severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.
__Bernadette Howie, if you're not able to do this, come home. It won't change how I feel about you.
__Howard Thanks, honey, but I can't quit. If I do, I'll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.
__Bernadette Well, is there anything I could do to help?
__Howard No. Wait. Send more underwear.
__Sheldon Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn't know that I had bongos.
__Leonard Sheldon, it's three o'clock in the morning.
__Sheldon Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
__Leonard I was sleeping.
__Sheldon Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
__Leonard No, he doesn't.
__Sheldon Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
__Penny What the hell?!
__Leonard Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.
__Penny Why did you get bongos?
__Sheldon Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I'd give that a try.
__Leonard Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
__Penny Oh, Leonard, it's three o'clock in the morning. I don't care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.
__Sheldon Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
__Leonard Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.
__Sheldon Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.
__Leonard W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.
__Sheldon Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.
__Penny Where are you going?
__Sheldon Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs.  Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.
__Howard What are you doing here?
__Bernadette I'm here to help you get through this. You can't do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.
__Bernadette Oh, I love you.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, your bath is getting cold!
__Howard Don't worry, once she falls asleep, I'll spoon you like an armadillo.
__Leonard Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
__Amy That was kind of uncalled for.
__Leonard No, it was called for.
__Penny All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.
__Sheldon Penny, you're not trained. You're not licensed. Most importantly, you don't have access to my haircut records.
__Penny All right, honey, look, we've known each other for a long time now, right? I've taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you're sick, you've even saw me naked once.
__Leonard I'm sorry, duh, what?
__Penny It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I'm doing. Please let me cut your hair.
__Sheldon Amy, what do you think?
__Amy There's not a hair on my body I wouldn't let this woman trim.
__Sheldon Fine, let's go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.
__Amy There's only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
__Leonard What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
__Sheldon Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.
__Sheldon At the end of the haircut, Mr. D'Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.
__Penny Well, sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.
__Sheldon That's okay, I never understood them anyway.
__Penny Okay, what do you think?
__Sheldon Hmm, well, it's a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.
__Penny Ha, told you. Okay, I'm just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.
__Sheldon Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.
__Penny Okay.  Okay, yep, we're all done now. It's just, it's good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.
__Sgeldon Thank you very much.
__Penny You are welcome. Yeah, I'm gonna have to move.
__Leonard Oh, I don't know. I kind of promised myself I'd get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.
__Howard You're about to walk up three flights of stairs.
__Leonard Good point, I'm in.
__Raj You know what would be great? Let's do it like the old days.
__Leonard You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?
__Raj Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.
__Howard Turn off our phones so our moms can't call.
__Leonard It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
__Howard They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
__Raj We were badass back in the day.
__Leonard All right, let's do it.
__Howard 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.
__Raj It's on like Alderaan.
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon
__Raj Woo-hoo!
__Sheldon Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego's? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
__Leonard We are going to play the online game.
__Sheldon The online game? Bully!
__Amy Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party.
__Sheldon Just tell her I can't come.
__Amy She'll be disappointed if we don't show up.
__Sheldon She's 93. She won't be disappointed for very long.
__Amy No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it's none.
__Sheldon Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.
__Amy You use it to get your way.
__Sheldon I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
__Amy You gave me your word. You're coming with me.
__Leonard We'll miss you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That's for babies.
__Howard Yeah, but it's got lightsabres.
__Sheldon Yeah, please, Amy! It's got lightsabres!
__ Credits sequence.
__Stuart Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?
__Sheldon Yes. I'm attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?
__Stuart Uh, I don't know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.
__Sheldon Do you supply the the tennis ball?
__Stuart No.
__Sheldon Then no. What else?
__Stuart Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.
__Sheldon Well, she'd just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.
__Sheldon Oh, it's not your fault. I've been to the model train store. I've been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.
__Leonard I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
__Sheldon No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren't anything but flippin' pains in the bottom.
__Leonard That's what your father used to say?
__Sheldon Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.
__Howard Look, if you don't want to go to the party, just don't go. You're a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she'll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.
__Raj I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn't help.
__Sheldon Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.
__Howard Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation.
__Sheldon You're right. I'm smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
__Penny You don't have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
__Leonard Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.
__Penny Really, what were you hoping for?
__Leonard I don't know, maybe that you'd be a little upset, and then you'd realize that I'm a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.
__Penny Okay, I'm an actress. Ask me again.
__Leonard Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
__Penny Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn't see you at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can't put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.
__Leonard Ay papi? What is that?
__Penny An acting choice.
__Leonard Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?
__Penny Choo got a problem with that, papi?
__Leonard Uh-uh.
__Sheldon Penny!  Penny!  Penny!
__Penny Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
__Sheldon Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.
__Penny Gummy bears? Thank you.
__Sheldon Now that you're in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party.
__Penny Not a chance.
__Sheldon All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.
__Leonard Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I've been burned more than once.
__Penny All right, sweetie, I'm not going to get involved in your relationship.
__Sheldon Oh, come on. It's just a simple favour. Now, when's the last time I asked you to do something for me?
__Penny Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
__Sheldon When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn't a medical emergency?
__Penny Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
__Sheldon All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.
__Penny What's that?
__Sheldon I'm going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Amy I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt's nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It's like a vacation for your teeth.
__Sheldon All right.
__Amy You sure you're okay with this?
__Sheldon Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
__Amy Thank you. That means a lot to me.
__Sheldon Oh, don't thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt's awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.
__Amy Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you're going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn't that a little rude?
__Sheldon Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won't hear a word the old geezers are saying.
__Amy You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I've already told everybody I'll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.
__Leonard You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
__Raj Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.
__Leonard Well, we're always the good guys. In D&D, we're lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we're the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.
__Sheldon Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
__Howard Hey, guys, I got a surprise.
__Leonard Uh, if it's yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.
__Howard No. Bernadette's going to be playing with us. So, that's pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.
__Howard I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she's parking the car right now.
__Sheldon Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
__Leonard Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long for it to be funny.  I was wrong, it's still funny.
__Amy My boyfriend's a jerk.
__Penny Well, I know he didn't cheat on you, so what happened?
__Amy I had to go to my aunt's party all by myself, and everybody was like, where's this boyfriend you're always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?
__Penny Who's Armin the miniature horse breeder?
__Penny I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
__Amy Oh, that's good.
__Penny Mm.
__Amy I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
__Penny Sure, I get that. I mean, he's your first boyfriend and all.
__Penny Yes. On purpose.
__Amy He's handsome, he's lanky, he's brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.
__Penny Well, sickly is the new sexy.
__Amy Yeah.
__Penny Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you're in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.
__Amy Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
__Penny That's hilarious. No.
__Sheldon Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn't as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn't make the land speeder go.
__Bernadette Pew!
__Leonard Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
__Raj Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn't know how much fun it was killing stuff.
__Leonard All right, I think we got them all. Let's divide up the loot.
__Bernadette Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we'll match.
__Howard But I worked hard to get this armour.
__Bernadette Sorry, I just thought it'd be nice if people knew we were a couple.
__Howard Fine, I'll change.
__Sheldon Hah-hah!
__Penny Oh, come on. They're playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…
__Amy Like that?
__Penny Wow. Yeah, b-beginner's luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I'm gonna drink this entire cup and then I'm going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?
__Amy Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.
__Penny Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on.
__Amy That'd be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
__Penny Wars.
__Amy What?
__Penny Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
__Amy What's the difference?
__Penny There's absolutely no difference.
__Amy How do I get him to treat me better?
__Penny All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I'd say give him the silent treatment.
__Penny Hmm.
__Amy Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.
__Penny All right, then we're gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.
__Amy I don't think I'd be good at that.
__Penny That's why you're lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I'm not allowed into. Both Chili's.
__Bernadette I can't help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
__Sheldon That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
__Amy Sheldon Cooper, I've got a bone to pick with you, and I'm about to do it in front of all your friends.
__Penny Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!
__Amy I'm gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.
__Penny Ooh, burn!
__Amy And if you don't start treating me better, I'm leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.
__Sheldon Armin who?
__Amy Armin… damn it.
__Amy You're hurting me.
__Penny No, Sheldon hurt you.
__Amy Before; now it's you.
__Penny Oh.
__Sheldon I think I understand. You're the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can't lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.
__Penny Sheldon, she doesn't want your stupid…
__Amy Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let's go.
__Sheldon Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat.  Oh, grow up, Leonard.
__Raj But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it's like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I'll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!
__Penny And that's how a girl makes a scene. I'm sorry, sweetie. You're right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let's go.
__Amy What about the Science Center?
__Penny I'll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
__Amy Rain check.
__Bernadette I'm gonna go, too.
__Bernadette I'll miss you.
__Howard I'll miss you more.
__Bernadette No, I'll…
__Raj Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it's supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.
__All Hear! Hear!
__Raj I can't believe this is only 64 calories.
__Howard That's my ride, got to go.
__Sheldon Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.
__Penny Okay, you're right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.
__Sheldon Oh, that's very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I'll come a-knocking.
__Howard Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in. I'm supposed to ask you if you're bringing someone to the wedding.
__Raj I'll let you know.
__Howard Well, can you make it soon. There's a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette's mom, and the other three, mine.
__Sheldon Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.
__Leonard Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster's wedding.
__Sheldon They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.
__Howard Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom's trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.
__Raj Alright, uh, fine, I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.
__Leonard Who you bringing?
__Raj Who are you bringing?
__Penny He's bringing me. Who are you bringing?
__Raj Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells.
__Howard Come on, who is it?
__Raj I'm not telling. I'm from Asia. I'm mysterious. Deal with it.
__Sheldon Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?
__Howard No, uh, I don't think so.
__Sheldon Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.
__ Credits sequence.
__Mrs Koothrappali Pretty good, can't complain.
__Dr Koothrappali Oh I'm sure you can. Just give it a minute.
__Raj Listen, uh, there's something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn't ready until now, but I think it's time.
__Dr Koothrappali It's finally happening. You're coming out of the closet, aren't you?
__Mrs Koothrappali We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.
__Raj No, I'm not gay. If anything, I'm metrosexual.
__Dr Koothrappali What's that?
__Raj It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
__Dr Koothrappali Well, if you're not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?
__Raj ‘Cause I, I'm tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I'd like you to help me find uh, a wife.
__Mrs Koothrappali And just to clarify, a female wife?
__Raj Yes.
__Dr Koothrappali Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.
__Mrs Koothrappali We married for love.
__Dr Koothrappali And it's been wonderful.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm glad.
__Sheldon It's like looking at the universe naked.
__Penny Hi, you guys got a minute?
__Leonard Sure, what's up?
__Penny Well, I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke the other night about me eating all your food.
__Sheldon Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group's resident cut-up.
__Leonard I'm sorry, you are our resident cut-up?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Prove it.
__Sheldon Knock, knock.
__Leonard Who's there?
__Sheldon Interrupting physicist.
__Leonard Interrupting physi…
__Sheldon MUON!
__Penny Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!
__Sheldon Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!
__Leonard Where did you get that?
__Penny Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.
__Leonard You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
__Penny Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.
__Sheldon Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
__Penny Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?
__Sheldon Not this time. Then they wouldn't be special. Thanks Penny.
__Penny You're welcome. Don't worry, I didn't forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.
__Penny Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!
__Leonard Awesome!
__Sheldon Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.
__Penny Oh, that's great. Let's open it up and put him in there.
__Leonard Ah!
__Sheldon Oh dear Lord. No!
__Sheldon They're mint in box.
__Leonard They're Collectables.
__Penny C'mon can't we just open one up and take a…
__Leonard Once you open the box it loses its value.
__Raj Oh yes. In my culture it's expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.
__Bernadette The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
__Howard Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.
__Raj Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she's here.
__Howard Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
__Raj It's different. You're people don't worship lox.
__Howard Well clearly you've never been to brunch with my cousins.
__Bernadette So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?
__Raj Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I'm sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I've been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.
__Girl Excuse me, are you Rajesh?
__Raj Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.
__Lakshmi Nice to meet you too.
__Raj Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.
__Bernadette Hello.
__Raj And this is Howard.
__Howard Nice to meet you.
__Lakshmi You too.
__Raj Please have a seat.  I'm thinking double wedding!
__Sheldon Is someone there?
__Spock Down here, on your desk.
__Sheldon Spock?
__Spock I need to speak with you.
__Sheldon Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
__Spock It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.
__Sheldon Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
__Spock I'm not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.
__Sheldon But it's mint in box.
__Spock Yes, and to open it would destroy it's value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not going to dignify that with a response.
__Spock Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?
__Sheldon To be played with.
__Spock Therefore? To not play with it would be?
__Sheldon Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you're right. I'll do it.
__Spock Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.
__Sheldon Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right?  Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I'm so excited, but this is wrong. I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it. I did it. Oh, that's what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise.  Energise.  Don't be broken. Please don't be broken.  What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard's toy) It's only logical.
__Raj Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.
__Lakshmi Impressive. What goes into making something like that.
__Raj Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.
__Raj Well, let's see. Yup, three missed calls.
__Lakshmi Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.
__Raj I'd like to tell them things are going well.
__Lakshmi Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we're on the same page.
__Raj Okay, what page are you on?
__Lakshmi I'm on the one where I'm on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I'm going to do it so they don't find out I'm gay.
__Raj Say again.
__Lakshmi I'm gay.
__Raj Like, dude on dude, but with women?
__Lakshmi I know a fake marriage isn't an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.
__Raj Why me, of all people?
__Lakshmi Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you're, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.
__Raj I'm not gay.
__Lakshmi Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I'm sorry, but you're wearing more perfume than I am.
__Raj That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it's unisex.
__Raj I like to boogie.
__Lakshmi Got you.
__Raj W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
__Lakshmi That's disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.
__Raj Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don't want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.
__Spock Hello again, Sheldon.
__Sheldon What is it now, tiny Spock?
__Spock I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard's. You should be ashamed of yourself.
__Sheldon You're the one who told me to play with it.
__Sheldon No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.
__Spock Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he's never going to open it, so he won't know it's broken. And I have a toy that isn't broken. Everybody's happy.
__Spock Well I am unhappy.
__Sheldon I thought where you come from they don't have emotions.
__Spock I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.
__Sheldon You know what you are? Well, you're a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it's time you beam on out of here.
__Spock Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.
__Sheldon Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. (Throws Spock away. Get's attacked by a Gorn. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.
__Howard Yep, one sec.  Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she'd found out I'd broke my retainer.
__Raj Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It's about Lakshmi.
__Howard Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
__Raj We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she's a lesbian.
__Howard What do you mean, she's a lesbian?
__Howard Then why did she even go out with you?
__Raj She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I'm actually thinking about doing it.
__Howard Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is 'cause it's crazy.
__Raj Look, Howard, you're in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.
__Howard Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette's or my mom's.
__Raj It's a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don't have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I'm married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.
__Howard Why don't you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn't slept with more women than you.
__Raj Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
__Howard So you're seriously thinking about marrying someone you're never going to have sex with.
__Raj I can't believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
__Howard Yes, to other gay people.
__Raj Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Nothing. I said nothing.
__Penny That was weird.
__Leonard Really? I don't even notice any more.
__Penny I cannot believe you guys aren't going to play with these.
__Leonard Well I told you, you don't, it's mint in box.
__Penny I dunno. I just think it's a waste.  Relax. I'm just looking at the box.
__Sheldon Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.
__Penny What is your problem?
__Sheldon My problem is that I don't want you to break Leonard's toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.
__Penny Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don't want it to just sit in this box.
__Leonard You know, you're right. I mean, it's from you, I'm never going to sell it. I'm opening it.
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Mmmmm!
__Leonard It's broken.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Oh, nice job, man-hands.
__Penny I didn't break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.
__Sheldon Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let's all be mad at Stuart.
__Penny You know, I paid a lot for this. Let's take it over there and show him.
__Leonard Absolutely.
__Sheldon Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn't tell you.
__Leonard Why would you open mine?
__Sheldon I didn't. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
__Leonard Well, you should talk to Stuart.
__Sheldon I can't because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that's a lie.
__Penny What is the truth?
__Sheldon My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
__Leonard Okay, that I believe.
__Penny Mmm.
__Sheldon Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That's a lie.
__Leonard So, is that one mine.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Well, hand it over so I can open it.
__Sheldon Okay. Leonard, even though I don't have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.
__Leonard And that's a lie, right?
__Sheldon Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
__Bernadette Raj, Howie told me what's going on with you and Lakshmi.
__Raj What, you told her?
__Howard I told everybody.
__Bernadette We believe there's someone out there who'll love you for you.
__Howard Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn't marry this woman.
__Bernadette Not necessarily. I think we've found someone for you to cuddle with.
__Raj Oh, my goodness. Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?
__Howard Her. We thought you two would hit it off.
__Raj I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let's see if you fit in my man purse.
__Bernadette Metrosexual my ass.
__Raj I don't mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.
__Howard Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.
__Leonard You're kidding.
__Raj Why?
__Howard He's coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he's looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.
__Leonard That's amazing. You'll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.
__Howard You're right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.
__Raj Oh, boy, Sheldon's going to freak out.
__Leonard Yeah, he worships Hawking.
__Howard I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.
__Raj That's really nice of you, Howard.
__Howard Hm, it's no big deal.
__Leonard Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.
__Sheldon Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity's understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it's two a.m., get out of my bedroom?
__Leonard Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
__Sheldon Well, I believe I've done it. And I'm only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.
__Leonard Really?
__Raj That's incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.
__Sheldon Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn't going to make any sense to you.
__Howard Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.
__Sheldon Yeah, good for you, and don't stop working on it.
__Raj Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
__Howard Yep.
__Leonard Still going to introduce him?
__Howard Not on your life.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard I told you, no.
__Sheldon But I said I'm sorry.
__Howard No, you said, would it help if I said I'm sorry?
__Sheldon And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
__Howard Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?
__Sheldon Um, to go to Jewish heaven?
__Howard Jews don't have heaven.
__Sheldon Then to avoid Jewish hell?
__Howard Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
__Sheldon Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.
__Howard Oh, you can't be serious.
__Sheldon Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there's another human being.
__Howard Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
__Sheldon Yeah, okay, I can see you're going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.
__Howard Get out of my lab.
__Sheldon Oh, now they're so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?
__Howard Get out.
__Sheldon How about dolphins?
__Howard Out!
__Howard It was great. We talked about movies.
__Sheldon Oh!
__Howard I showed him some card tricks.
__Howard He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
__Sheldon Oh!
__Howard Something got you down there, bunky?
__Sheldon Howard, please, I'm begging you.
__Leonard Raj, you're our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?
__Raj Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn't believe in to end his life quickly.
__Sheldon Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.
__Howard You're kidding.
__Sheldon No, sir, no, I took my dad's desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.
__Howard You don't seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.
__Sheldon It's actually 01100111.
__Howard No!
__Sheldon I'm not asking for me, I'm asking for Hawking.
__Howard Let me try gansta, hells no.
__Leonard What if he doesn't?
__Sheldon He will, he's really smart.
__Howard That's an interesting idea. Why don't you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
__Sheldon How do I do that?
__Howard You walk away.
__Sheldon Walking away.
__Leonard You do realize you own his ass right now.
__Howard I do.
__Raj You can make him do anything you want.
__Howard Yeah, I know, I'm just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.
__Raj Well, don't be too mean.
__Sheldon Hey, fellas, I'm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.
__Raj I wouldn't mind a glass.
__Sheldon I wasn't talking to you.
__Raj Bring him to his bony knees.
__Howard Sheldon, come on back.
__Sheldon Yes, yes. What did you decide?
__Howard I'll give your paper to Professor Hawking.
__Sheldon Great, thank you. Oh, that's terrific.
__Howard But in exchange, I'd like you to do a few things for me.
__Sheldon What kinds of things?
__Howard Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?
__Sheldon Of course.
__Howard You should be so lucky.
__Howard Well, I thought I'd start you off by polishing my belt buckles.
__Sheldon Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.
__Sheldon That's a lot of belt buckles.
__Sheldon You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw's forks never had that.
__Howard Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.
__ Sheldon, these look great. They're like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How'd you get them so shiny?
__Sheldon Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.
__Howard Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
__Sheldon My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
__Howard Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.
__Sheldon And you want me to return it for you?
__Howard No, no, no, mon petit cherie.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny It's not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
__Penny Wow, are these Amy's? Kind of trashy, good for her.
__Sheldon Those are Howard's.
__Penny Ugh. Why are you washing Howard's man panties?
__Sheldon Because if I don't, he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He's a famous physicist.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, I know, he's the wheelchair dude who invented time.
__Sheldon That's close enough.
__Penny I don't understand, why doesn't Howard just introduce you to the guy?
__Sheldon Because he's punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don't think I'm condescending, do you?
__Penny Well…
__Sheldon Oh, I'm sorry, condescending means…
__Penny I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.
__Sheldon Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.
__Penny Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.
__Sheldon Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
__Penny See, there it is, there's that twinkle.
__Sheldon Well, I can't help it. That's an involuntary twinkle.
__Penny What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?
__Sheldon I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
__Penny Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.
__Sheldon I knew it.
__Bernadette Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im.
__Howard It's not her fault. She's getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid's costume.
__Bernadette Oh, my God, that's terrible.
__Howard Hey, I gave you first crack at it.
__Bernadette Why are you doing that? You're being mean to him.
__Howard He's mean to me all the time. You've heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
__Bernadette If you don't want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they're great.
__Howard Oh, come on, the man torments me. I'm just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.
__Bernadette It's not the same thing. Sheldon doesn't know when he's being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
__Howard Fine, I'll just make him do a couple more things, then I'll stop.
__Bernadette No, you have to stop now.
__Mrs Wolowitz Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!
__Bernadette Oh, damn. I'm sorry, I can't make it, but Sheldon's going to go with you! And that's the last thing you do to him.
__Mrs Wolowitz It's this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It's like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!
__Sheldon What do you want me to do?
__Mrs Wolowitz We're gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.
__Sheldon I'm not sure how to do this.
__Mrs Wolowitz It's easy, just pretend you're putting away a sleeping bag.
__Sheldon Sleeping bags don't usually sweat this much, but okay.
__Mrs Wolowitz Now zip me up.
__Mrs Wolowitz You're right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?
__Sheldon Oh, no, you know, I'm not really the holding kind of… Oh!
__Leonard What are these?
__Howard Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?
__Raj Wow, that's amazing.
__Howard Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.
__Sheldon I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.
__Howard I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.
__Sheldon Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
__Howard I don't know.
__Sheldon Oh, for heaven's sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.
__Howard All right, Sheldon, there's only one thing left I want you to do. Don't worry, it's an easy one.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Howard Give me a compliment.
__Sheldon Fine. You have very tiny hands.
__Howard No, about my job. I want you to tell me I'm good at what I do.
__Sheldon You're obviously good at what you do.
__Howard Well, then why are you always ripping on me?
__Sheldon Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It's just that what you do is not worth doing.
__Leonard It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me. I'd take it and run.
__Howard Thank you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
__Howard Sorry, I can't.
__Sheldon What, why not?
__Howard I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.
__Raj I thought he might be a little more excited.
__Leonard Give it a second.
__Hawking I know.
__Sheldon I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
__Hawking My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.
__Sheldon I know.
__Hawking Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.
__Hawking That's nice. Too bad it's wrong.
__Sheldon What do you mean wrong?
__Sheldon No, no, th-th-th-that can't be right. I-I don't make arithmetic mistakes.
__Hawking Are you saying I do?
__Sheldon Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It's just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.
__Hawking Great, another fainter.
__Raj Okay, uh, I'd pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I've always dreamed of having.
__Sheldon Wrong. Leonard?
__Leonard Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.
__Sheldon Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we?
__Howard Kangaroo, uh, I'd be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.
__Leonard Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body.
__Sheldon Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.
__Leonard Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
__Sheldon All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I'll just snack on this sunlight.
__Raj He got us again.
__Leonard No, he didn't.
__Raj Anyway, if it's okay with you, we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.
__Sheldon Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you're half swan.
__Howard Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.
__Raj You don't want strippers? You're the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
__Howard What can I tell ya, I'm not into that stuff any more.
__Leonard Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you. And still, you're the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.
__Sheldon You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
__Howard Well, it's probably not for me.
__Raj Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They've got that wine train.
__Sheldon Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I'm in.
__Raj Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There's a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It's magic.
__Leonard Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.
__Leonard Well, I don't know. It's a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn't that make you a little jealous?
__Penny Oh, come on Leonard, it's you. What's going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you'd do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.
__Leonard Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.
__Penny Really? What is the craziest thing you've ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.
__Leonard Oh, come on, that's got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.
__Penny Well, have fun tonight.
__Leonard Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.
__Penny Yeah, there is.
__Leonard You know, there's nothing wrong helping some woman's kid get through their S.A.T.'s.
__Sheldon It's not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
__Leonard Are you drinking whisky?
__Sheldon Indeed. If I'm to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That's yucky.
__Leonard Whoa, it's a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don't you think?
__Wil Wheaton Hey, you guys.
__Leonard Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.
__Wil Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei's house.
__Sheldon I'm confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.
__Wil Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.
__Sheldon Oh. I guess you're just friends with anybody.  Aagh!
__Leonard Oh, yeah, no worries.
__Stuart And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
__Leonard Oh, all right.
__Stuart And gas money to get home.
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Stuart Great. You know what? This is my grandfather's watch.
__Leonard Oh.
__Stuart 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.
__Leonard Wow, that's very nice.
__Stuart Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it's yours.
__Raj Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he's a jolly good fellow…
__All For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.
__Kripke Yes, yes, yes. He's a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?
__Howard Actually, Barry, we're not going to have strippers tonight.
__Kripke Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?
__Stuart You want to buy a watch?
__Bernadette Um, these are gift bags we're going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie's relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.
__Penny Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.
__Amy All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you'll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?
__Bernadette Amy, please.
__Amy Keeping in mind that whoever's on top may set the tone for the marriage.
__Penny Okay, show's over.
__Amy Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don't you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?
__Penny I don't care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard's name? Not who's going to sit on who?
__Bernadette I've actually been thinking I' Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.
__Penny Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.
__Bernadette Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.
__Penny Oh, that's cool.
__All Hear! Hear!
__Sheldon And, apparently, Wil Wheaton's best friend.
__Wil Sheldon…
__Sheldon Talk to the hand.
__Raj Does anyone have any words they'd like to say about our man of the evening?
__Sheldon Yeah, I do.  As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard's expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you'd be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let's see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you're actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that's a zinger, because you're not. I've always thought that you'd make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you'd be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don't see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don't!
__Leonard Sheldon…
__Sheldon Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.
__Leonard So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn't even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…
__Kripke Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up.
__Leonard Right. To Howard.
__All To Howard.
__Leonard I totally had sex in the ocean.
__Stuart Okay, I'll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can't help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I'm 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.
__Raj Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who's next?
__Kripke I'll go. Howard, I'm gonna say something to you that evewybody's thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That's not unweasonable.
__Raj Hear, hear.
__All Hear, hear.
__Raj Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn't know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.
__Kripke Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine. (Tucks a dollar in Raj's pants.)
__Raj I'm not done, but thank you.  I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I'm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.
__Howard She was my second cousin.
__Sheldon And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!
__Raj Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one's my favourite!
__Howard Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down.
__Raj Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?
__Howard Don't remember. Please sit down.
__Raj The only threesome I've ever had in my life, and I'm proud to say it was with this man right here.
__Howard Oh, please shut up.
__Raj Oh, oh, don't get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.
__Wil Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.
__Sheldon Jeepers, I'm drunk.
__Bernadette Funny. You boys have a nice time?
__Howard Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.
__Bernadette That's nice.
__Howard How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.
__Raj's Voice Raj' Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one's my favourite.
__Raj You know, we're not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.
__Bernadette You ain't goin' anywhere, Threeway.
__Howard Bernadette, listen…
__Bernadette You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you've been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!
__Raj Seriously, you don't even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.
__Howard Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn't hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.
__Bernadette Don't you try and blame this on him.
__Raj Thank you, Bernadette.
__Bernadette Zip it, pervert!
__Amy I'm curious what's bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?
__Penny Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn't?
__Amy Right. And that was…
__Penny Not.
__Bernadette When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.
__Penny Well, if that's what you like, I'll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of 'em.
__Bernadette Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
__Penny Well, a little. You hear stuff.
__Bernadette Why didn't you tell me
__Penny Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.
__Bernadette My God! I thought you were my friend.
__Amy I don't think that was helpful.
__Raj Dude, I am so sorry.
__Howard It's not your fault, it's mine. I did all that stuff, not you.
__Leonard Actually, you did do one of them together.
__Sheldon Here.
__Howard What is this?
__Sheldon You're upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
__Howard No, but what is it?
__Sheldon Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it's been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.
__Howard I don't know what my next move is.
__Leonard Well, Howard, I don't know much about women.
__Howard Yeah?
__Leonard No, uh, that, that's it. I don't know much about women. Raj, you got anything?
__Raj I've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
__Howard I'm not calling the girl from Comic-con.
__Raj All right. More Sailor Moon for me.
__Sheldon I just threw up the bachelor party.
__Bernadette No, leave me alone.
__Amy Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
__Penny Amy.
__Amy Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I'm just trying to clean up your mess.
__Howard Oh, hi.
__Penny Hey.
__Howard I need to talk to Bernadette.
__Penny Well, I don't think she wants to talk to anyone right now.
__Howard All right, well, could you at least give her a message?
__Penny Yeah, sure, I guess.
__Howard Tell her I'm really sorry, and if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she's disgusted by, is the guy that I'm disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn't exist any more, he's gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.
__Penny Oh, my God, Howard. That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. And it came out of you.
__Bernadette Howie?
__Howard Penny has a message for you.
__Bernadette I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother's, travels through walls.
__Howard Do you want me to go?
__Bernadette No. Come here. I'm still really mad at you.
__Howard I get that.
__Bernadette Is there anything else about your past I should know?
__Howard Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I'll tell you later.
__Bernadette Okay.
__Howard So, is the wedding still on?
__Bernadette Yeah, the wedding's still on.
__Amy Oh, thank God. I'm still a maid of honour.
__Penny Oh, what the hell.
__Amy This is kind of hot.
__Penny What's with the robe?
__Leonard I'm gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.
__Penny No, you're not.
__Penny If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.
__Leonard Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.
__Voice Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission.
__Howard Yes, yes, I've been doing my push-ups. I'm still stuck at nine, but that's going all the way down with no one holding me.
__Howard You're kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I'm really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too.  Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I'm not gonna die in space! I'm gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.
__Assistant Okay.
__Leonard Do you think maybe it's tight because you're wearing long underwear?
__Sheldon Yes, of course that's why it's tight.
__Leonard All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?
__Sheldon You're kidding. Shouldn't the question be why aren't you?
__Leonard why are you?
__Sheldon Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don't like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?
__Assistant Why don't you slip this on?
__Sheldon Said the hangman offering a noose.
__Raj Well, that wasn't as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.
__Howard Well, that's it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.
__Leonard I'm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I'm a little relieved you're not going.
__Howard Why?
__Leonard Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.
__Howard Well, their technology isn't that bad.
__Raj When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.
__Howard All right, well, whatever. I wasn't worried.
__Raj You weren't?
__Howard Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.
__Raj Oh, please. I don't remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.
__Howard Make all the jokes you want, but there's only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.
__Sheldon Ah, much better.
__Leonard You must be burning up.
__Sheldon A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever's in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!
__Assistant Uh, where's he going?
__Leonard He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
__Sheldon Keys! Keys! Keys!
__Leonard Before I come in, you should know, I have gas.
__Penny For the record, not your worst opening line.
__Leonard Check it out. It's the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
__Penny B-Before I do it, if you're a cop you have tell me, right?
__Leonard Just try it.
__Penny Okay.  What's it supposed to… Oh, my God, this is so freaky!
__Leonard You're a mean one Mr. Grinch.
__Penny Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?  Leonard, I am your father.
__Leonard I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
__Penny Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we've been taking things slow?
__Leonard Mm-hmm.
__Penny Well, I've been thinking, and maybe I'm ready to take things a little faster.
__Leonard Oh, great.
__Leonard And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you're gonna get.
__Penny You know, just-just one thing. Look, we're in a really great place right now, and I don't want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.
__Leonard So we won't let it get weird.
__Penny Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.
__Leonard What about  Cookies!
__Amy Seven o'clock, right on time.
__Sheldon It's not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
__Amy Well, dinner's almost ready.
__Sheldon I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that's a hot date.
__Amy Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.
__Sheldon What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
__Amy With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I've decided that we should make progress in ours as well.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn't even know each other, and now I'm in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?
__Amy I had a feeling you'd be reluctant, which is why I'm going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.
__Sheldon Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.
__Amy I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
__Sheldon And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you're not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there's only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that's called school.
__Amy Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I'm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.
__Sheldon Well, seems what's on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.
__Amy We'll see. Let's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?
__Sheldon Super Mario Bros. theme?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon I see what you're doing. You're attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won't work.
__Amy Fine. There's no reason we still can't have a lovely dinner. Why don't you have a seat.
__Sheldon Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.
__Amy May I offer you something to drink?
__Sheldon You know I don't drink.
__Amy Not even strawberry Quik?
__Sheldon I love strawberry Quik. It's my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.
__Amy Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.
__Sheldon Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
__Amy Just like your mommy used to make.
__Sheldon Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.
__Penny Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
__Leonard I don't know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.
__Penny Okay, well, they sure as hell don't say that.
__Leonard It was the heat of the moment.
__Penny No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?
__Leonard I'm sorry. Just, just give me another chance.
__Penny Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?
__Leonard Again, I'm sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.
__Penny You can't take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?
__Leonard Okay, at some point, we'll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don't we just start doing that now?
__Penny You're kidding.
__Leonard No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.
__Leonard Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
__Bernadette You're kidding.
__Howard No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.
__Bernadette Oh, you're in a good mood.
__Howard Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be? You know, I'm marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon.  Oh, hang on. Oh, it's NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What's up? No kidding. Really? Well, that's great news. Great, great news. All right, I'll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon.
__Bernadette What's so great?
__Howard It looks like I'm going into space after all.
__Bernadette Oh, Howie, that's wonderful!
__Howard Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.
__Bernadette What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.
__Howard Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they're putting me on an earlier launch.
__Bernadette When?
__Howard A week from Friday.
__Bernadette What? We're getting married that Sunday.
__Howard You're right. I, I can't go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that's not a good reason. I'll call him back.
__Bernadette Wait. I don't want to be the one who stands in your way.
__Howard Well, too bad, you already did. It's a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.
__Bernadette No. That's not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We'll have the wedding when you get back.
__Howard But what about all the plans and the guests?
__Howard You're right, he is! Your dad's gonna be furious. There's no way he's gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.
__Bernadette I'll talk to him. He won't say no to his little girl.
__Howard No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.
__Bernadette But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He's gonna make you cancel your space flight.
__Howard We can only hope… that he doesn't.
__Leonard Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?
__Sheldon I'm fine.
__Leonard Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?
__Sheldon Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?
__Leonard We got you that book last year. Wasn't everything in there?
__Sheldon No, I'm having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.
__Leonard Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.
__Sheldon Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol' ladies.
__Leonard I guess we are. So, what's going on?
__Sheldon Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.
__Leonard I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you.
__Sheldon It's awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it's usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.
__Leonard Shame on her.
__Sheldon They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.
__Leonard She's good.
__Sheldon I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
__Leonard You mean, like in bed or in the shower?
__Sheldon No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy's dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?
__Leonard Well, if you had a physical relationship, I'd say propose during sex. Turns out that's a real mood killer.
__Sheldon I assume we're talking about you now?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon So, that's how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?
__Leonard Pretty much.
__Sheldon Well, no wonder the women are winning.
__Mr. Rostenkowski I'm just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.
__Howard Family pictures, or… holy crap, that's a dead person.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it's a trick question.
__Howard I'm not sure.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Nah, you'll never get it. It's a fraction.
__Howard How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Walnut?
__Howard No, thank you. I'm allergic.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He's dead now.
__Howard From nuts?
__Mr. Rostenkowski Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way.
__Howard Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Yeah, so?
__Howard So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you're going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I've got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Where are you going?
__Howard I'm sorry. May I be excused?
__Mr. Rostenkowski No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you… You just gonna stand there?
__Howard I'm sorry, I didn't know, is this going to… Well, I should sit… May I be seat… Well, I'll just sit.
__Mr. Rostenkowski When I first met you, I didn't like you.
__Howard I'm aware of that, sir.
__Mr. Rostenkowski But then you and I had some time together.
__Howard Uh-huh.
__Mr. Rostenkowski It did not get better.
__Howard Right, right.
__Mr. Rostenkowski That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.
__Howard Oh, I am. And just so you know, I'd still be an astronaut, even if I didn't go to space. I've got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.
__Mr. Rostenkowski No, no, you got to go. You can't turn down an opportunity like this.
__Howard But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
__Mr. Rostenkowski You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud.
__Howard Um, okay.
__Mr. Rostenkowski You got a problem with that?
__Howard All right, look, I'm gonna level with you. I'm terrified about going into space. What if I don't make it back?
__Mr. Rostenkowski It's gonna be okay, son.
__Howard You really think so?
__Mr. Rostenkowski Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she'll find a new guy.
__Leonard Hey. Off to work?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Have a nice night.
__Penny Okay, you, too.
__Leonard Penny, just, wait. I've been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.
__Penny Yeah, I've been thinking about it, too.
__Leonard I noticed you never answered me.
__Penny You're right.  No.
__Leonard Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?
__Penny Yep.
__Leonard Is it still weird 'cause I proposed?
__Penny Yep.
__Leonard I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
__Penny No!
__Leonard I played that pretty well.
__Amy Hello, Leonard.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Amy We're playing doctor. Star Trek style.
__Sheldon I'm in hell, Leonard. Don't stop.
__Cosmonaut Launch step twelve acknowledged.
__Howard Hey Mike?
__Mike Massimino Yeah.
__Howard I changed my mind. I don't want to do this.
__Mike Good one.
__Sheldon 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.
__Amy I love his eidetic memory, it's so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?
__Sheldon Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.
__Amy The uterus quivers, does it not?
__Leonard There's Howard's rocket, live from Kazakhstan.
__Bernadette Oh, God, I'm so nervous. I don't think I can watch.
__Raj You're nervous? I've been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I'm wearing my fat pants.
__Sheldon Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard's keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.
__Bernadette Give me those damn Pringles.
__Mission Control Da.
__Mike Okay, we're in the final countdown. How you doing over there?
__Howard Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Check.
__Cosmonaut He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?
__Howard No, it's 'cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.
__Cosmonaut Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.
__Mike Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.
__Cosmonaut Congratulations.
__Howard Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.
__Cosmonaut You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?
__Howard Not exactly. Listen, if you don't mind, I'm not really up for chatting. I'm just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.
__Bernadette Come on, Howard. I'm not falling for that again.
__Howard No, here.
__Bernadette Oh, Howie. A little star, it's beautiful. Put it on me.
__Howard Okay, but I'm going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.
__Bernadette Oh, my God.
__Howard Take that, every guy who's ever bought you anything.
__Bernadette This is the most amazing gift I've ever gotten.
__Howard Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.
__Mrs Wolowitz ‘m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?
__Howard No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!
__Bernadette Howard, I don't want to wait until you're back to get married.
__Howard What?
__Bernadette I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
__Howard But I'm leaving in two days.
__Mrs Wolowitz What about Apple Jacks?
__Howard I don't need to take cereal.
__Mrs Wolowitz What kind of breakfast do you think they're going to give you in Russia?
__Howard They invented blintzes. I'll be fine.
__Mrs Wolowitz They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn't mean they hand them out to you when you go.
__Bernadette We'll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we'll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.
__Howard Wow. Okay. Let's get married.
__Mrs Wolowitz You know what, I'll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.
__Leonard That's so great.
__Howard I mean, we know it's short notice, but we'd love you all to come with us.
__Amy No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.
__Bernadette That wasn't going to be our processional music.
__Sheldon Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn't sound like something I'll enjoy.
__Leonard Come on, Sheldon, it'll be fun.
__Sheldon That's what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
__Bernadette So, what do you say, Amy?
__Amy Can I wear my maid of honour dress?
__Bernadette Seriously? You're going to wear that thing to City Hall?
__Amy It's all I have left. You're going to take that from me, too?
__Amy I know.
__Leonard Where'd you get a beer?
__Raj From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they're in rival drug gangs, and they're getting married. Shh, no one can know.
__Amy Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?
__Sheldon It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?
__Howard You proposed to Penny?
__Leonard I don't want to talk about it.
__Raj Where did he pop the question? What did you say?
__Leonard She said no, can we drop it now?
__Penny It wasn't a real proposal.
__Bernadette Why wasn't it a real proposal?
__Sheldon He asked her during coitus.
__Howard Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?
__Bernadette Howard, don't talk like that on your wedding day.
__Howard I'm sorry, Ma… Bernadette. Ma… Burna… You're ma Bernadette.
__Penny Good move telling Sheldon.
__Leonard What, I can't propose? I can't talk to my friends? Is there anything else I'm not allowed to do?
__Amy All right, that's enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.
__Registrar Folks, can I have your attention. It's five o'clock, we're going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.
__Bernadette Oh, no.
__Howard I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I'm an astronaut and I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.
__Registrar Yeah, me, too. I'll see you there.
__Bernadette I can't believe we're not going to get married.
__Amy Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.
__Mike You know you're going to wind up walking it.
__Cosmonaut I know.
__Howard Uh, shouldn't you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?
__Mike Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.
__Dimitri Okay, I'm going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.
__Mike Is that better?
__Howard Thanks.
__Bernadette No, isn't that kind of tacky?
__Penny Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.
__Bernadette Are any of them still married?
__Penny Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…
__Bernadette There's got to be some place special we could do it.
__Sheldon Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?
__Leonard Will you shut up?
__Howard I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.
__Raj Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you're willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.
__All Oh!
__Leonard That's so cool.
__Howard Oh, wait to go, Raj.
__Raj I keep telling you, if I wasn't an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.
__Howard Okay, so we know we're going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.
__Leonard How about our roof?
__Bernadette Oh, I like that.
__Howard That's great.
__Amy Oh, my gosh. I can't believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.
__Howard So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who's going to do the ceremony.
__Penny Well, that's easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they'll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.
__Bernadette Great, well, who's it going to be?
__Sheldon I'll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.
__Bernadette No.
__Sheldon What do you see in her?
__Howard Leaking? What's leaking?
__Dimitri Fuel. Shh.
__Mission Control Not bad. We feel okay to go.
__Dimitri Okay, thanks Mission Control.
__Howard There's fuel leaking and we're still going to go?
__Mike Don't lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.
__Dimitri This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.
__Howard What happens on the tenth time?
__Dimitri Problem.
__Raj Oh, thanks, man.
__Sheldon You didn't have to do that.
__Howard Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.
__Leonard Oh, wow.
__Sheldon Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.
__Howard What?
__Sheldon While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.
__Howard Yeah, so?
__Sheldon I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can't be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.
__Leonard I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.
__Sheldon Well, what if it's his only way out? I can't risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we're even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.
__Howard It's the groom.
__Amy Can't come in. Bad luck to see the bride.
__Howard Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I'll be right back.
__Bernadette Why can't she drive herself?
__Howard She doesn't want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I'm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour's van.
__Bernadette All right, just hurry!
__Howard Okay, I'll see you later, Ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.
__Raj What, we're ready when I say we're ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we're ready.
__Howard Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?
__Mrs Wolowitz I'm fine where I am. I don't want to fall off the roof.
__Howard You'll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
__Raj Penny.
__Mr Rostenkowski Your new mother-in-law's a piece of work.
__Bernadette Not now, Dad.
__Mr Rostenkowski She's got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.
__Bernadette Here you go? What am I, a football?
__Mr Rostenkowski Like that guy could catch a football.
__Raj Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.
__Mrs Wolowitz Louder!
__Bernadette They all got ordained, they're all marrying us, it's adorable, if you want to hear come closer.
__Raj Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I'm going to need a minute.
__Penny Okay, I'll, I'll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you're in love, it doesn't matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.
__Leonard Hmm.
__Penny Problem?
__Sheldon I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
__Penny Oh, grow up.
__Leonard Hey, I didn't say it.
__Amy All right, that's enough from the both of you.
__Penny Well, he started it.
__Amy Well, I'm ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.
__Leonard Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that's the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.
__Sheldon Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu' taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.
__Bernadette Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.
__Sheldon Fine, I'll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one's life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I'm so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.
__Raj I believe you two have prepared vows?
__Howard Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.
__Mrs Wolowitz Speak up!
__Howard Hey, from now on, she's the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn't imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can't imagine spending one day of it without you.
__All By the power vested in us, by the state of California…
__Sheldon And the Klingon High Council…
__All We now pronounce you husband and wife.
__Dimitri Me, too.
__Howard I have strongly mixed feelings.
__Penny Did I miss it?
__Leonard No, come on in. Hurry.
__Bernadette I love that man.
__Raj Me, too.
__Penny I can't believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.
__Leonard This is it.
__Sheldon Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.
__ Oy vay!
__Leonard Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.
__Raj Right now, Howard's staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.
__Sheldon I must admit, I can't help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.
__Leonard You know, it's not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other's recycled urine.
__Stuart Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.
__Raj I wonder what he's doing right this very second.
__Leonard Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.
__Raj Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
__Sheldon Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.
__Howard I can hear you without the phone,
__Mrs Wolowitz Don't be snippy. I'm just excited to talk to my baby.
__Howard I'm excited to talk to you, too.
__Mrs Wolowitz So, what's this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?
__Howard How about calling her my wife?
__Mrs Wolowitz Wives don't take boys from their mothers.
__Howard They do. That's why we marry them.
__Mrs Wolowitz I just hope I'm not dead from a broken heart before you get back.
__Howard Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.
__Mrs Wolowitz Good. They should know what a horrible son you are.
__Howard Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?
__Amy Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.
__Penny That's hot. You kids better use protection.
__Amy How long does this stay on?
__Penny Just a couple of minutes. You've really never done this before?
__Amy Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.
__Penny Oh, my gosh, that's awful. The other kids make fun of you?
__Amy No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how's everything going with you and Leonard?
__Penny Uh, I don't know, it's still kind of weird. We haven't really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.
__Amy Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.
__Leonard Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…
__Sheldon You don't even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.
__Leonard I know what the anthropic principle is.
__Sheldon Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?
__Leonard Where do you stand on it?
__Sheldon Strongly pro.
__Leonard Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.
__Raj Hey, guys.
__Sheldon Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
__Raj I'm all for it.
__Sheldon Attaboy!
__Leonard Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't?
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard. Let's not take a saw to the branch we're sitting on, shall we?
__Raj Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don't need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.
__Leonard Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny.
__Raj Oh, okay. Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?
__Sheldon As I've stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh, chills. Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.
__Raj Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.
__Sheldon Darn. If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us.
__Raj Really? I can come? Thanks.
__Leonard Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?
__Sheldon Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can't outsource that to an Indian.
__Howard Hey, there's my beautiful bride. Can you see me?
__Bernadette I can. How are you?
__Howard I'm amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it's all so unbelievable.
__Bernadette Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
__Howard Oh, yeah? That's nice.
__Bernadette It was. Until I found out you never told her we're not gonna live with her. Let's talk about that for a minute.
__Howard Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?
__Bernadette You said you told her, but you never did!
__Howard Okay, okay, I know you're upset, but let me share something I've learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you're looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that's got to make you feel better.
__Bernadette How clear is the image of me on that screen?
__Howard Pretty clear.
__Bernadette Do I look like I feel better?
__Howard I mean, it's not, like, HD quality.
__Bernadette Listen, mister, you're gonna talk to your mother and you're gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.
__Dimitri Like he's been doing since he got here.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm glad you like it. Raj picked it out.
__Amy Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.
__Sheldon Tell him yourself.
__Raj Yoo-hoo! Over here!
__Amy I don't understand. What's he doing here?
__Sheldon I invited him.
__Amy On our date? Sheldon, that's not okay.
__Sheldon Yes, it is. There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.
__Amy You found a loophole?
__Raj Sorry I started without you. I'm a little nervous. It's been a long time since I've been on a date.
__Amy I can't believe I bleached my moustache for this.
__Raj You should go to my girl. She'll knock out those sideburns for free.
__ Later.
__ You know, Amy, I don't even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let's use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.
__Amy Go home.
__Raj I don't understand.
__Amy Sheldon, how could you do this? It's our second anniversary.
__Raj It's your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right.
__Amy Thank you.
__Raj My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn't this romantic?
__Sheldon Oh, I hope that's a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.
__Leonard No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.
__Penny That is so sweet.
__Leonard I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.
__Penny Go Sports?
__Leonard Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn't want to look ridiculous.
__Penny This is awesome. I love it!
__Leonard Good, I'm glad.
__Penny Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.
__Leonard Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.
__Penny Ah, thank you!
__Leonard So, where exactly are we in this relationship?
__Penny Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.
__Leonard You're right, I'm sorry. Let's watch the game.
__Penny Great.
__Leonard I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.
__Penny Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?
__Leonard Absolutely. You're the girl, I'm the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard Oh, I'll get it. Go sports.
__Raj Hello-lo-lo.
__Leonard What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.
__Raj I was, but it's their anniversary and I didn't want to be a third wheel, so I figured I'd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.
__Leonard Well, it's not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.
__Penny No, we don't! Come on in!
__Leonard I can't believe I shaved my stomach for this.
__Howard Who is it?
__Dimitri A woman who says she's your mother but sounds like your father.
__Howard Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.
__Mrs Wolowitz I'm not going near that fakakta thing. I'll catch a computer virus.
__Mrs Wolowitz Oh, so now you're an astronaut and a doctor?
__Howard What do you want, Ma?
__Mrs Wolowitz Your wife says you have something important to tell me.
__Howard Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and…
__Howard Ma…
__Mrs Wolowitz It's okay. Your father left me, you left me, I guess I'm just the kind of person people like to leave.
__Howard It's not definite. I'll talk to Bernadette.
__Mrs Wolowitz Don't bother. I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I'm no trouble when I die.
__Howard Stop it, Ma. I'm sure I can get Bernie to come around.
__Mrs Wolowitz I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can't let a woman tell you what to do.
__Howard Okay, okay.
__Dimitri Oy. I can't believe these people won the Cold War.
__Howard Now, can we please change the subject?
__Mrs Wolowitz Fine. Explain why you've been gone so long and I haven't gotten a single letter. Not even a lousy postcard.
__Penny Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
__Raj Well, it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?
__Penny All right, who's ready for another beer?
__Leonard I'm good.
__Raj No, thank you.
__Penny Girls.
__Raj Oh, I'm having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?
__Leonard That's great. Get out.
__Raj What? Why?
__Leonard Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.
__Raj Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you've always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.
__Penny Okay, hold on…
__Raj Now, don't blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.
__Leonard Some people might say it was romantic.
__Raj Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night.
__Leonard Okay.
__Penny That's enough.
__Raj I'm just saying that after everything you've been through, you get to look into each other's eyes and say “I love you.” And that's beautiful.
__Leonard Actually, to this day, she's never really said it.
__Raj Oh, Penny. That's ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it.
__Penny Raj.
__Raj Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!
__Sheldon Every time you drink alcohol.
__Amy You know what's wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.
__Sheldon Your point being?
__Amy Dessert is served.
__Sheldon I just had cobbler.
__Amy You know what? I'm done with this.
__Sheldon W-Where are you going?
__Amy I'm leaving.
__Sheldon You can't leave. I need you.
__Sheldon Yes. You're my ride.
__Amy Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.
__Sheldon All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don't know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.
__Amy Sheldon, that was beautiful.
__Sheldon I should hope so. That's from the first Spider-Man movie.
__Amy I'll take it.
__Sheldon Good. Now, I assume we're splitting the cheque?
__Stuart Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.
__Stuart No, no. It's okay. Hang out.
__Raj You sure?
__Stuart Yeah, you're my first customer today.
__Stuart I'm, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?
__Raj What are you drinking?
__Stuart Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.
__Raj Perfect for the night I'm having. Thank you.
__Stuart Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.
__Raj Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog's water bowl.
__Stuart You're kidding.
__Raj She's kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?
__Stuart Cheers.
__Raj Cheers.
__Stuart A little music?
__Raj Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
__Stuart Mmm.
__Raj Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I'm on a white sand beach in Rio.
__Stuart Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.
__Raj I should go.
__Stuart Yeah.
__Raj Uh, thank you for the drink.
__Stuart No problem.
__Raj Hey, Stuart.
__Stuart Yeah?
__Raj Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?
__Stuart Yeah, I-I'd like to, but I'm a little tight on funds.
__Raj No problem. My treat. I'll swing by after work.
__Stuart Okay.
__Raj Okay.
__Stuart I could do worse.
__Howard Hey, I'm a grown man. I'm gonna live with my wife. My mother's just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.
__Bernadette Was she upset?
__Howard Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.
__Bernadette Thanks for fixing it. I love you.
__Howard I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I'll talk to you tomorrow?
__Bernadette Good night, Rocket Man.
__Dimitri Loops. You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother.
__Howard I know.
__Dimitri What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?
__Howard Oh, I'm never going back.
__Penny Ooh, one gravy boat.
__Amy That's from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.
__Bernadette In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.
__Penny One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.
__Amy When I get married I'm going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.
__Penny Ew, why?
__Amy ‘Cause I've always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
__Bernadette So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?
__Amy Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don't tell Sheldon. He's still a flight risk.
__Bernadette What about you, Penny?
__Penny What about me what?
__Bernadette Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?
__Penny Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.
__Bernadette But do you think you'll ever get married?
__Penny He's a sweetie.
__Amy You're not answering the question. Do you love him?
__Penny Yeah, sure, of course I love him.
__Bernadette It doesn't sound like it.
__Penny Well, I do.
__Bernadette Do you tell him that?
__Penny No, he'd just take it the wrong way.
__Amy What does that mean?
__Penny It means he is special and smart and nice and…
__Bernadette Are you gonna break up with him?
__Penny No. Maybe. I don't know.
__Penny That's the thing, I'm not. I'm not unhappy at all. It's just, I don't know, I, I've been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?
__Bernadette Oh, that's not really a fair comparison. I'm basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.
__Penny Amy, you?
__Amy Can't help ya, kid. Whenever I'm around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard You don't have to shout, Raj. It's not like I'm an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.
__Leonard So, is it everything you hoped it would be?
__Howard It's better. I wake up every morning and I just can't believe I'm on this incredible adventure.
__Howard Excuse me. I'm talking to my friends.
__Mike You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.
__Dimitri If you do good job, next time we give you brush.
__Howard Funny. We're always giving each other a hard time up here. It's kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.
__Sheldon Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.
__Leonard Go ahead.
__Sheldon 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over.
__Howard Yes, I read you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Copy that. Over.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon I am talking to a man in space. If you don't have the  then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.
__Howard You're out of your mind,Sheldon.
__Sheldon That's a negative. My mother had me tested. Over.
__Mike Come on, scrub it up, Loops.
__Howard All right, all right. I gotta go. There's a meteor shower.
__Mike You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.
__Howard Bye.
__Sheldon Over and out.
__Raj Bye, buddy!
__Stuart Hello.
__Raj Hey, Stuart, come on in.
__Sheldon What are you doing here?
__Stuart Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.
__Sheldon Excuse me. I didn't authorize this.
__Leonard Sheldon, you are not in charge.
__Sheldon That's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
__Raj What's the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn't want to sit by myself.
__Sheldon The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we're going to be a faceless mass of six.
__Leonard It'll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.
__Sheldon Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?
__Stuart I can take them or leave them.
__Sheldon At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.
__Stuart Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?
__Sheldon Well, it's hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn't crunch during the film and it's Raisinets.
__Stuart Okay. Should we go?
__Sheldon Yuh-uh, one more question, if you're going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.
__Stuart All right.
__Sheldon Wolowitz went to MIT. What's your educational background?
__Stuart I went to art school.
__Sheldon Equally ridiculous. Let's go.
__Amy Well, I like it.
__Sheldon Yeah, of course you do. You're a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.
__Amy Just watch the movie.
__Sheldon It's not fair. Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.
__Amy There might be a reason for that.
__Sheldon Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.
__Amy Penny said she's not sure she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.
__Sheldon Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
__Amy So?
__Sheldon So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches' brew of his soda and spit?
__Amy It's complicated.
__Sheldon String theory is complicated. That's just yucky. Don't get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let's say that's true. Why doesn't Penny just end the relationship?
__Amy She's not sure how she feels.
__Sheldon How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They're fish with a sword for a nose.
__Amy Regardless, don't say anything to Leonard.
__Sheldon Now you're asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?
__Amy Yes, please, Penny will kill me.
__Sheldon Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it's another fish with a tool on its head.
__Stuart Raisinet?
__Sheldon Shh, we're trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.
__Sheldon I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won't go as far forward as it used to.
__Leonard Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
__Sheldon Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.
__Leonard I'm starting to get a sense of it. Don't worry. I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
__Sheldon Thank you. I appreciate that. You're good people, Leonard. There's something I need to tell you.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon I can't tell you.
__Leonard Why?
__Sheldon I can't tell you why I can't tell you. So I guess there's two things I can't tell you.
__Sheldon Good night. I'm sorry. This is really important.
__Leonard What is it?
__Sheldon I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?
__Sheldon Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I'm going to pause to let that sink in.
__Leonard Okay, I think I understand.
__Sheldon You do?
__Leonard The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.
__Sheldon That is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
__Leonard What?
__Leonard I was. Now I'm having a nightmare. What do you want?
__Sheldon Never mind. I still can't tell you.
__Penny Oh, my God. Sheldon?
__Sheldon You frightened me.
__Penny What are you doing in my bedroom?
__Sheldon Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn't hear it.
__Penny How did you even get in, you weirdo?
__Sheldon Yeah, really? I've seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it's weird?
__Penny What do you want, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you're up, we could talk.
__Penny Talk about what?
__Sheldon Oh, I don't know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.
__Penny Sheldon.
__Sheldon Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.
__Penny Okay, go home, crazy man.
__Sheldon Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today's North Korea, he's downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.
__Penny Okay, what did Amy tell you?
__Sheldon Oh, very well. I can't keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.
__Penny Okay, you listen to me. I think it's really sweet you're trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?
__Sheldon Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I'm a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
__Penny Of course not.
__Sheldon Homeostasis refers to a system's ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
__Penny Worst bedtime story ever.
__Sheldon My point is I don't like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we're on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I'm not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.
__Penny Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?
__Sheldon I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?
__Penny Get out.
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Please don't hurt my friend.
__Penny That is the last thing I want to do.
__Sheldon Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?
__Penny Get out.
__Penny What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in?
__Amy Hang on, please. Hello?
__Sheldon Yeah, just a heads- Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She's pretty mad.
__Amy I know. She's yelling at me right now.
__Sheldon All right then, so we're all on the same page. Yes.
__Bernadette There's my hubby. How's everything going up there?
__Howard Oh, it's okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.
__Howard Nothing. Everything's fine.
__Bernadette Howard.
__Bernadette No, what are they doing?
__Howard Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.
__Bernadette Oh, Howie.
__Howard You can see it if you want. It's on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.
__Bernadette Why don't you stand up to them?
__Howard What am I supposed to say?
__Bernadette I don't know. Say, being mean is lame, what's cool is being nice.
__Howard Great, I'll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.
__Bernadette Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?
__Howard No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.
__Raj Focused Locust.
__Stuart Temple of Yip.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.
__Stuart All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.
__Sheldon Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.
__Raj So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.
__Stuart We're gonna try to meet some girls.
__Raj ‘Cause that's what we do.
__Stuart Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.
__Raj In case you didn't follow that, I'm the coffee.
__Sheldon Leonard? Maybe you'd like to go with them to meet girls.
__Leonard Why would I be interested? I have Penny.
__Sheldon Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I'd get a back-up.
__Leonard You can't just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
__Sheldon Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?
__Leonard Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.
__Sheldon But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.
__Leonard What's your point?
__Sheldon Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
__Leonard This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?
__Stuart I like Mark Ruffalo, too.
__Sheldon Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.
__Penny Really?
__Leonard Yup. I told him if he didn't bite the hygienist, I'd take him for ice cream.
__Penny Mmm.
__Leonard I didn't have to take him for ice cream.
__Penny Uh-huh.
__Leonard You okay? You seem a little distracted.
__Penny Look, there's something I need to tell you.
__Leonard Oh. Yeah, okay.
__Penny I don't really know how to say this.
__Leonard Just say it.
__Leonard Mm-hmm.
__Penny I didn't know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.
__Bernadette Oh, sure, you had no choice.
__Penny He looked at me like this.
__Amy Well, if that's all it takes, it's a good thing you don't have a dog.
__Bernadette Don't worry. You'll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.
__Penny Look, it's fine. We're not getting married, okay? We're keeping things, you know, homeostasis.
__Amy It's so cute when she tries.
__Penny It's from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You're amazing. I'm so lucky to have you in my life.  Okay, stop it.
__Bernadette Oh, Howie.
__Howard What's wrong? You look upset.
__Bernadette Nope, this is my proud face.
__Bernadette Hey, how's my little astronautie hottie?
__Howard Okay, I guess. It's just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.
__Bernadette Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you'll be home.
__Howard I know.
__Bernadette I got to get back to work. I love you.
__Howard Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?
__Bernadette What do you want me to do?
__Howard Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?
__Bernadette Really, you're serious? Okay.
__Howard Oh, baby, you're killing me.
__Sheldon Oh, thank you, Penny.
__Penny M-hmm.
__Sheldon Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.
__Penny Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what's in it?
__Leonard Mmm, doesn't matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.
__Sheldon Yeah, it's journals and research papers I wrote as a child.
__Penny Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?
__Penny Really, your potty training journal?
__Sheldon Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn't start typing until I was six.
__Penny August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?
__Sheldon There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.
__Penny Oh, disgusting.
__Leonard No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track.
__Penny Why do you need all this stuff?
__Leonard No, no, no, no.
__Penny Sorry!
__Sheldon I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
__Penny Of course, it is, it's been in the news. And it's a very famous boson.
__Sheldon Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.
__Penny Yeah, that's basically what I said.
__Sheldon Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.
__Leonard I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
__Penny You really think there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?
__Leonard So, you're going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
__Sheldon That's a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.
__Leonard Not gonna happen.
__Sheldon Well, if I didn't think you could handle it, I wouldn't be asking.
__Leonard If you want help, just hire a grad student.
__Penny Maybe I could do it.
__Sheldon You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.
__Penny A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I'm just a blonde monkey to you, aren't I?
__Sheldon You said it, not me.
__ Credits sequence.
__Ms Jenson No, thanks. I'm fine.
__Sheldon Now, are you sure? Everyone's smoking them. I think they're the best.
__Ms Jenson I don't do drugs.
__Sheldon Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They're not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you're from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you're summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn't cause any hearing loss.
__Ms Jenson No, of course not. How did you know about that?
__Sheldon I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.  I trust you paid off those parking tickets.
__Ms Jenson Yes, I did.
__Sheldon Hearing unimpaired, good.
__Ms Jenson Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.
__Sheldon Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.
__Ms Jenson It's not flattery if it's the truth.
__Sheldon Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.
__Raj Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable. (Entering Sheldon's office) Hey, Sheldon, hope you're hungry, they're serving macaroni and…  che-ee-ee-ese.
__Leonard Smooth. Hi.
__Ms Jenson Hello.
__Leonard Sheldon, aren't you going to introduce us?
__Sheldon No. I have people for that now. You're up.
__Ms Jenson I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's new assistant.
__Leonard Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I'm Leonard. This is Raj.
__Alex It's nice to meet you. I'm so excited to be working with Dr…
__Sheldon Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.
__Alex I should probably get to work.
__Raj Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.
__Howard Uh, no, not really.
__Bernadette What's wrong?
__Howard Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?
__Bernadette Uh-huh.
__Howard It's delayed. We're gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It's the Russians, so you don't know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.
__Bernadette Come on, Howard. No one's leaving you up there.
__Howard I don't know how much longer I can take this. I can't sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I'm down to my last three Tums.
__Bernadette You're going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
__Penny Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.
__Amy Oh, I don't know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell's gynecologist.
__Penny Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so… who are you calling?
__Amy I'm going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the room.
__Alex Dr. Cooper's office.
__Amy Oh, hello. Who are you?
__Alex I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's assistant. Can I help you?
__Amy I'd like to speak to Sheldon.
__Alex I'm sorry. He's asked me to hold all calls unless you're Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.
__Amy All right. Well, tell him Amy called.
__Amy He knows my last name. I'm his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I'll send you a PDF.
__Alex All right, I will tell him you called.
__Penny What?
__Amy Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn't mention that Alex was a girl.
__Penny Maybe he didn't notice.
__Amy You're right. I don't have to worry about Sheldon.
__Penny No, you do not.
__Amy It's her I have to worry about.
__Penny Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.
__Amy Oh, really? Look at this face (Sheldon's picture on phone) How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?
__Penny Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.
__Amy I'm not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant. (Throwing open Sheldon's office door) Aha!
__Penny Can we go now?
__Amy Hang on. (Rubs Sheldon's telephone receiver under her armpit)
__Penny What are you doing?
__Amy Isn't it obvious? I'm spreading my scent to mark my territory.
__Penny Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.
__Amy Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.
__Sheldon Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy's problem?
__Raj I'm in her head. Let the dance begin.
__Alex Here's your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.
__Leonard This should be fun.
__Sheldon Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?
__Alex Yes.
__Sheldon Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
__Alex Rainbow, not chocolate.
__Sheldon Two cherries?
__Alex One on top, one on the bottom.
__Sheldon Stems removed?
__Alex Um, top one, yes. I didn't check the one on the bottom.
__Leonard Oh!
__Alex I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.
__Sheldon It's all right, Alex. I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed.
__Leonard Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?
__Alex Um…
__Sheldon Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it's appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?
__Leonard Given her what?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon It's a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that's just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.
__Leonard Oh, sure. Please join us.
__Alex Oh, okay. Thank you.
__Leonard So, Alex, what's the topic of your dissertation?
__Alex I'm looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth's L-Five Lagrange point.
__Leonard Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali's field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.
__Alex Is that true? Is he all right?
__Leonard No. But compared to your boss, he's the poster boy for sanity.
__Alex It's okay, I've been around scientists all my life. My dad's an astronomer at SETI.
__Leonard Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.
__Alex So, what kind of research are you doing?
__Alex Ooh. Military?
__Leonard Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.
__Amy You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank's your problem, not mine.
__Alex You're very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon Cherry stem! Cherry stem!
__Howard Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don't have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.
__Bernadette Okay.
__Howard Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I'll leave the door unlocked.
__Bernadette Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you're having a little anxiety.
__Howard No, no, I'm fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon 'cause froggy wants to come home.
__Penny There's nothing to be brave about. Everything's fine.
__Amy Really? I don't know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon's assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.
__Penny Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don't even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.
__Amy So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he's desirable.
__Penny Well, of course he's desirable. I mean, he's great. He's smart, he's sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.
__Amy So it does bother you.
__Penny Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn't bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn't stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.
__Amy And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.
__Leonard Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.
__Penny Oh! You're kidding.
__Penny Wow. Anything else?
__Leonard Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn't talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.
__Penny Oh, is that it?
__Sheldon Oh, good, Leonard, you're here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.
__Leonard What do you got?
__Leonard What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it's not exactly groundbreaking.
__Sheldon The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
__Alex Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.
__Penny Oh, it's about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I'm Penny.
__Alex Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
__Penny In a way. We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
__Alex Oh. Well, you're lucky. He seems very talented. And I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him.
__Penny My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
__Alex She seems nice.
__Sheldon Notice people on your own time. We're working.
__Howard Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.
__Bernadette Howie, stop that. NASA's watching this! Put your pants back on!
__Howard Whee! Whee!
__Leonard It'll be good to have him back.
__Raj The Fantastic Four reunited.
__Sheldon Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We'll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard's gym membership.
__Raj We're not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
__Sheldon Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you're the tiebreaker.
__Leonard I don't have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.
__Sheldon Well, I don't sell my friendship that cheaply.
__Stuart I can go thirty.
__Sheldon Welcome aboard, old chum.
__Raj Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard's final descent has begun.
__Sheldon He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.
__Howard Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz
__Mike What's that?
__Howard The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don't have one for falling out of space! We did it! We're on the ground! We survived!
__Mike That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go.
__ Credits sequence.
__Man in Suit That's nice.
__Bernadette He's coming back from outer space.
__Man in Suit I think this flight's coming from Houston.
__Bernadette No, I mean, he… Never mind. There he is! Howie!
__Various others Howie! Howie!
__Howard Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.
__Howie Mandel Uh, I think they're here for me, Ringo.
__Howie Mandel Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he's an astronaut.
__Bernadette I missed you so much.
__Howard I missed you, too. Where are the guys?
__Bernadette Oh, it's just me.
__Howard Oh, I get it. They're waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don't worry, I can act surprised.
__Bernadette No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me.
__Howard Gesundheit. You okay?
__Bernadette I am now that you're back. Come on, let's go home so I can tear off those little pants.
__Howard Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.
__Amy Me, too. But we'll see him tomorrow.
__Sheldon Yes, it's just that in all the years I've known him, he's never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.
__Penny You're unbelievable.
__Sheldon I know.
__Leonard All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?
__Penny How about boys versus girls?
__Sheldon Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I'm not on has a decided disadvantage.
__Penny Once again, unbelievable.
__Sheldon Yeah, once again, I know.
__Penny All right, round one. Here.
__Sheldon Got it.
__Penny Okay. Ready, set, go.
__Amy Uh, box? Uh, window?
__Leonard Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.
__Amy Uh, gift? Uh, Present!
__Penny Present! Yeah!
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?
__Leonard In what universe is that a present?
__Sheldon It's not a present, it's the present. Look. There's you and me. There's Penny and Amy. We're playing Pictionary. In the present.
__Penny Oh, my God, we're gonna kill them.
__ Later
__ It's a quark-gluon plasma.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon It's asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
__Leonard Nothing with quarks.
__Sheldon It's an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
__Leonard No.
__Penny It's a chocolate chip cookie.
__Amy Yes.
__Leonard How could you miss that?
__Sheldon Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.
__Leonard Penny got it.
__Sheldon Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You're welcome.
__ Later
__ Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.
__Amy Penny, aren't you gonna draw something?
__Penny Relax, we got time, this is so fun.
__Sheldon There.
__Leonard A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don't…
__Amy Now?
__Penny Soon.
__Sheldon Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.
__Leonard I don't know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?
__Penny All right, that's enough.
__Amy Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?
__Penny Yep!
__Sheldon Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn't enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.
__Penny Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.
__Sheldon Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
__Bernadette Yeah, I'll be right there.
__Howard Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?
__Bernadette It's just allergies.
__Howard Okay.
__Bernadette Took some Benadryl. I'll be fine. So, did you miss me?
__Howard Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…
__Bernadette Ew. Excuse me.
__Howard Sweetie, we don't have to do this now.
__Bernadette Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.
__Howard You okay?
__Bernadette A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.
__Howard Okay.
__Bernadette Now, kiss me.
__Howard Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?
__Bernadette That was amazing. You made me feel things I never…
__Howard Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.
__Sheldon Don't know.
__Penny I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome where they'd actually chop somebody's ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.
__Sheldon I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
__Leonard Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It's a pretty well-rounded game.
__Sheldon Lot of big talk from a man who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.
__Sheldon All right. Let's play Physics Fiesta.
__Penny Oh, come on, what is that?
__Sheldon It's a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?
__Leonard En el acelerador de particulares.
__Sheldon Bueno, mi amigo.
__Penny No, no, we're not playing some dumb made-up game.
__Sheldon All games are made up. They're not found in nature. You don't just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
__Leonard Just pick another game.
__Amy Why don't we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
__Leonard No good, Sheldon doesn't float.
__Sheldon That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.
__Amy All right, let's keep it simple. How about darts?
__Sheldon No, that's not fair either.
__Penny Why not?
__Sheldon Darts is a bar game. You've been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
__Leonard Yeah, that's when it started.
__Sheldon Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they're all out.
__Penny Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I've won a few, but that's just because I spill when I'm drunk, so…
__Amy We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Uh-uh.
__Amy Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn't light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard? I thought I wasn't going to see you till tomorrow.
__Howard Yeah, well, Bernie's not feeling well, so I thought I'd stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.
__Mrs Wolowitz Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I'm not decent.
__Howard All right. Woman hasn't tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she's not decent?
__Man's Voice Man' You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?
__Mrs Wolowitz Shh, you need to whisper.
__Howard Ma, who is in there?
__Mrs Wolowitz Uh, nobody. The TV is on.
__Man's Voice Man' I only got one sock. Where's my other sock?
__Howard Who is that?
__Mrs Wolowitz I told you, it's the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it's hilarious.
__Howard If you're busy, I can come back.
__Mrs Wolowitz Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.
__Dr Schneider Oh, hello, Howard.
__Howard What are you doing here?
__Dr Schneider Um, house call.
__Howard You're a dentist.
__Dr Schneider Yes, yes, I am. I think he's on to us.
__Sheldon Hurry up, find him, find him.
__Leonard I'm trying. Don't yell at me.
__Sheldon For goodness' sake, he's wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.
__Leonard I know what he looks like.
__Amy Oh, there he is, I got him.
__Penny Yes, we win again.
__Sheldon How could you not find him?
__Leonard Because he's hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There's Waldo.
__ Later. Penny and Sheldon have their foreheads on light sabres and are spinning.
__ 57, 58, 59, that's one minute.
__Amy Long division, long division. Go, go, go.
__Sheldon I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm not okay.
__Leonard Get up, we can't lose at math.
__Penny 37.
__Amy Yes.
__ Later
__ Ready, set, wrestle.  One, two, three, pin.
__Penny Mwah!
__Sheldon Stop that.
__Penny Mwah!
__Sheldon Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.
__Raj Oh, my God, you're back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.
__Howard Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I'm like an inch and a half taller. I'm going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.
__Raj Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn't think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
__Howard Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little under the weather and my mom's kind of under my dentist.
__Raj Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
__Howard Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
__Raj So you're wandering all around by yourself? That's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to.
__Howard It's okay, you know, we space cowboys don't do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.
__Stuart Oh, hey, man, welcome back.
__Howard Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?
__Stuart I, I kind of live here now.
__Raj Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
__Stuart Ah, he's spoiling me and I love it.
__Howard Wow, so you guys are like buds now?
__Raj Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.
__Stuart Plus, he doesn't have a girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend.
__Raj It's like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other's holes.
__Stuart Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.
__Raj Which part?
__Stuart Just all of it.
__Howard Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?
__Stuart Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.
__Howard Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that's cool.
__Raj Oh, Howard, it's still our thing. Come with us, we'll, we'll get you a scalped ticket.
__Howard So I'd be sitting by myself?
__Raj We'll switch. You'll come sit with me after intermission.
__Stuart So I, I, I'd be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?
__Howard No, no, you guys go. Have fun.
__Raj Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?
__Howard Absolutely. See you, Stuart.
__Stuart Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?
__Howard At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
__Sheldon Wait. I'm a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?
__Leonard Sheldon, we haven't won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face.
__Sheldon That's rude.
__Amy One, two, three, eat.
__All Not now!
__Sheldon Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!
__Leonard Snort it down and keep eating!
__Howard I don't think so.
__Waitress Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You're an astronaut.
__Howard Yes. Yes, I am.
__Waitress Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?
__Howard Oh, thank you so much. I've been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don't care, my wife's sick, I went to my mom…
__Waitress You want the cheesecake or not?
__Stuart Well, Howard, that's very nice of you.
__Leonard Yeah, maybe. Open it first.
__Howard It's my official NASA portrait.
__Stuart To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.”
__Sheldon For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.
__Raj Hey, Stuart, I see you're getting ready for your Halloween party.
__Stuart Yeah, it's my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time's the charm.
__Raj Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
__Raj You know, you don't worry about money. I'll take care of everything.
__Stuart Really?
__Raj Yeah, you'll love it. Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.
__Howard But you know what wasn't a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it's your last night on Earth. You'd think you'd get one porn channel.
__Leonard Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
__Sheldon Interesting hypothesis. Let's apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.
__Leonard Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?
__Howard Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don't go there for the food, you go there for the view.
__Sheldon It's fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I've always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?
__Howard Not really.
__Sheldon Oh, well.
__Howard You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny I hope so.
__Amy Question. Do you think your husband's fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?
__Penny It's not getting any better.  Ugh. It's Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.
__Bernadette I thought you liked Halloween.
__Penny I do, it's just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.
__Bernadette Like my husband?
__Penny I'm, I'm sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard's foreskin?
__Bernadette Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we're going.
__Penny Yeah, I'm gonna go. It's just not my idea of a good time.
__Bernadette Leonard does thing he doesn't like to make you happy.
__Penny Well, yeah, he's my boyfriend. Isn't that, like, his job?
__Amy Then what's your job?
__Penny Letting him make me happy.
__Bernadette I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
__Amy That's not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.
__Bernadette You could start by taking an interest in his work.
__Penny Yeah, that's kind of a problem.
__Amy Why?
__Penny Not really clear on what he does.
__Bernadette He's an experimental physicist.
__Penny Yeah, I'm not really clear on what that means.
__Amy He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
__Penny Yeah, you're really just making it worse.
__Amy I think I'm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
__Sheldon Two tea bags in one cup? You're not at a rave.
__Sheldon I couldn't agree more.
__Amy Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.
__Sheldon Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart's party and all eyes turn to see America's most beloved and glamorous couple.
__Amy Yeah?
__Sheldon R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.
__Amy Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don't even like.
__Sheldon Okay, I'm gonna let that slide because I know you're hopped up on tea bags.
__Amy I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can't we find something that we're both happy with?
__Sheldon Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?
__Leonard Hey, what are you doing here?
__Penny I just thought I'd stop by and say hello.
__Leonard Oh, what a nice surprise. I don't think you've ever seen my lab before.
__Leonard No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.
__Penny You're kidding.
__Leonard Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
__Penny Ooh! What's going on in here?
__Leonard Oh, no, no, no, don't look in there.
__Penny What, is it secret?
__Leonard No, it's a nitrogen laser. It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.
__Penny Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.
__Leonard Sign right there.
__Penny Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What's, what's that?
__Leonard Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
__Penny Wow. High-techie-techie. What's this little box?
__Leonard That is a pencil sharpener.
__Penny Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?
__Leonard It's actually pretty neat.
__Penny Yeah?
__Leonard Yeah. It's a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I'll show you. We'll just put this pencil over here.
__Penny Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
__Leonard Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila.
__Penny Wow. That is amazing.
__Leonard You know, there's a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.
__Penny What do you mean?  Oh! Wow!
__Leonard Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  just be information  on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.  So it's possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.
__Penny Hmm.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
__Leonard You should visit more often. What are you doing?
__Penny Take off your clothes.
__Leonard What? Here? Now?
__Penny Yeah. You got a problem with that?
__Penny Really? Never?
__Leonard No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn't long enough.
__Howard Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.
__Raj On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
__Sheldon Night of the Living Garlic Bread?
__Raj It's funny because bread sounds like dead.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.
__Raj Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That's a good one. They'll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?
__Howard That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where's your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?
__Leonard Hello, boys.
__Sheldon What are you smiling at?
__Leonard Nothing.
__Howard You know where's there's a lot of nothing.
__All Space.
__Bernadette Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.
__Howard So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?
__Bernadette Okay, we need to talk.
__Howard What?
__Bernadette Howie, I know you went to space. I'm incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.
__Howard I don't talk about it every minute.
__Bernadette Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.
__Howard What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.
__Bernadette I'm just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.
__Howard So, I did this amazing thing and I'm never allowed to mention it?
__Bernadette Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
__Howard Okay, no problem. It won't happen again.
__Bernadette I love you.
__Howard I love you, too. I can't tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was… you know. What, I can't even point?
__Penny Whoa! That's heavy.
__Leonard Yeah. Oh, uh, you don't have on any jewellery, do you?
__Penny No. Why?
__Leonard A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he's on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.
__Penny Whoa! That is very cool.
__Leonard Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I'm the super villain Magneto.
__Penny Getting a little less cool, Leonard.
__Leonard But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
__Penny There we go.
__Sheldon A Tardis makes no sense. It's a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don't get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.
__Raj Do you have a preference?
__Howard I don't care. Get the Tardis.
__Sheldon Yes! This party just became a major rager.
__Raj Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?
__Howard Yeah, sure, whatever.
__Raj I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones' mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.
__Howard Nothing.
__Howard Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj No.
__Sheldon We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you're doing.
__Raj It's called being nice.
__Sheldon Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I'll try it.
__Howard You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won't talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.
__Leonard Hello, boys.
__Amy You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.
__Sheldon No, I don't think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it's a lost cause.
__Amy No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he's not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.
__Sheldon What's a hickey?
__Howard Fine.
__Bernadette Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that's like the funniest thing I've ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?
__Howard To tell you the truth, I'm not really in the mood.
__Bernadette What are you talking about? It'll be fun. All your friends'll be there.
__Howard Yeah, some friends. They all think I'm boring. Maybe you should go without me.
__Bernadette No, if I'm there alone, people might think I'm just a really short person from Avatar.
__Howard I'm sorry. I just don't want to go.
__Bernadette Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I'm gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.
__Howard Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.
__Bernadette Yeah, well, now you're a Smurf. Keep walking.
__Bernadette Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?
__Penny No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.
__Bernadette And Albert Einstein?
__Leonard Ja, und later she's going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.
__Penny I thought we said in the car, no accents?
__Leonard Sorry, Officer.
__Girl dressed as a Witch Hello. It's a great party.
__Stuart Thank you.
__Witch The monster foods, they're really fun.
__Stuart Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I'm fun. I'm not clinically depressed at all.
__Amy Sheldon, get in here.
__Sheldon I should've picked hickey.
__Amy I'm Raggedy Ann, and he's Raggedy C-3PO.
__Sheldon It was a compromise. I lost.
__Raj Can you believe Stuart's walking around taking credit for this party?
__Howard Who cares?
__Raj What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ's on fire, there's a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.
__Howard You're right, the party's fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven't heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.
__Raj Is this about the space thing again?
__Howard Well, I'm not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!
__Bernadette Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?
__Howard Great, now I'm in trouble. You happy?
__Bernadette You, out! You are being very rude.
__Howard No, I'm not. They're all being rude. And you're being rude.
__Bernadette Me? What did I do?
__Howard Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.
__Bernadette I don't sound like that.
__Howard You're my wife. You're supposed to be on my side.
__Bernadette I'm always on your side.
__Howard Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I'm ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I'm just…
__Bernadette Just what?
__Howard Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.
__Bernadette Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.
__Bernadette No, I'm not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.
__Howard I love you.
__Bernadette I love you, too.
__Penny Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.
__Leonard Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.
__Howard I don't know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.
__Buzz Here you go. It's a Milky Way. The Milky Way's a galaxy in space. I've been in space. Here's a Mars bar. I'm an astronaut. And this one's a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?
__Howard Okay, I get it.
__Howard Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now.
__Leonard Don't worry, this is exactly how you look when you're dancing in clubs.
__Raj You're welcome, ladies.
__Sheldon Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen.
__Raj Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.
__Sheldon Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?
__Howard That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.”
__Sheldon I'll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it's not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with…
__Raj I'm not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.
__Sheldon Friends! It's Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I'll have everything I've ever wanted since I was six years old.
__Leonard That's really nice, Sheldon, I'm happy for you.
__Sheldon And I'm happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.
__Howard Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.
__Sheldon And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you'll be off to the races.
__Leonard Sheldon, I don't think this actually means…
__Sheldon Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it's only a matter of time before we're coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I'll be Coop. He'll be Wheels. If he's okay with that.
__Raj All right. Crank up the AC, boys, it's gonna get hot in here!
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy I once looked in Sheldon's underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
__Bernadette There's a book under here.
__Penny Oh, I'll get that.
__Bernadette I got it.
__Penny No, no, it's…
__Bernadette I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?
__Penny No, it's not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.
__Bernadette That's great. I didn't know you wanted to go back to school.
__Penny It's just one history class. Look, I didn't finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.
__Amy Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.
__Bernadette Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?
__Penny No, I'm not embarrassed. I just didn't want anyone to know because I haven't told Leonard yet.
__Amy Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?
__Penny Because it's me going back to school, and he's gonna be all “you can do it,” and “how can I help?” and “I'm so proud of you.” Ugh!
__Bernadette I just can't believe you could keep something like that from him.
__Amy You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.
__Penny Really? You can't think of anyone weirder?
__Amy I can, but she's sitting right there.
__Amy Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.
__Sheldon It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I'm spanking him so hard his grad students won't be able to sit down.
__Amy You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.
__Sheldon What's your point?
__Amy It's exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
__Sheldon Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That's right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.
__Amy Oh, you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points.
__Sheldon Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.
__Amy Sorry.
__Sheldon Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract  Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain.
__Leonard It's crunchy. Just the way I like it.
__Penny Yeah, I don't think the water was really boiling.
__Leonard It's great. I love it.
__Penny Okay, listen, there's something I need to tell you. I've been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.
__Leonard Oh. That's great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?
__Penny I don't want you to make a big deal out of it.
__Leonard Why do you think I'd be like that? I get it, you're taking one class. It's nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.
__Penny You're making it a big deal.
__Leonard Sorry. Whatever. It's all good.
__Penny Anyway, that's it. I just thought you should know.
__Leonard Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?
__Penny It's really good. We've been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.
__Leonard Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.
__Penny Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor's black, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.
__Leonard Can I take a look?
__Penny No, Leonard, this is my thing.
__Leonard Okay, I get it.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard It's like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn't want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.
__Penny Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you're lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.
__Leonard Really? ‘Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.
__Howard Why?
__Raj Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I'm making fun of them.
__Howard That's ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.
__Raj Dude, my accent is brilliant.  Hey, my snow-white American friends, let's put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we're all obese.
__Howard This is what you sound like. I think I'm talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I'm wearing a set of giant dentures.
__Raj Sheldon, do I really sound like that?
__Howard Tell him he sounds like that.
__Raj Sheldon, you okay?
__Sheldon It's been three days. Why hasn't Stephen Hawking played a word?
__Raj The guy's a genius. Maybe you weren't challenging enough for him.
__Sheldon Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.
__Howard There's the problem. You can't beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy's a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.
__Sheldon Really?
__Howard One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.
__Raj Good Lord, what have I done?
__Howard Terrible.
__Raj All right, hotshot, let's hear your Indian.
__Howard I can't sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.
__Raj Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
__Leonard I did a bad thing.
__Sheldon Does it affect me?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play.  Stephen Hawking.  Stephen Hawking.  Stephen Hawking.
__Leonard Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn't want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.
__Sheldon Stephen Hawking hates me.
__Leonard I don't know what to do. I mean, the paper's terrible. But if I tell her, she'll know that I read it and she'll get really mad.
__Sheldon I was beating him so bad, he doesn't want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?
__Leonard Is it possible we're having two different conversations?
__Sheldon How would I know? I'm not listening to you.
__Leonard Hang on. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We'll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.
__Sheldon I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we're not friends anymore.
__Leonard He's probably busy. You're worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I'm sure he'll play, and you'll see that everything's fine. My turn. I can't let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it's bad without letting her know that I read it?
__Sheldon Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking's not busy because I can see he's playing other people right now.
__Leonard Maybe since you're so good, he's taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school…
__Sheldon Wolowitz told me he's a big baby. But I didn't know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It's all Amy's fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.
__Leonard Sheldon, I wasn't done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she's my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren't I allowed to help her?
__Sheldon Yeah, I hear you, brother.
__Leonard No. You need to give me some advice.
__Sheldon Fine. Women, huh?
__Leonard No, specific to my situation.
__Sheldon Blonde women, huh?
__Leonard Empathetic.
__Sheldon It sucks to be you.
__Leonard I quit.
__Sheldon Leonard, wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.
__Penny Leonard. It's eight a.m. It's like the middle of the night.
__Leonard I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.
__Penny Oh, wow, that's so sweet. Hey, what's this?
__Leonard Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?
__Penny Elves? Come on, Leonard. It's too early for Lord of the Rings.
__Penny Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?
__Leonard Don't ask me. A little elf did it.
__Penny So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
__Leonard No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.
__Penny What?
__Leonard No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.
__Penny You changed every word.
__Leonard That's not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That's all you.
__Penny You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn't want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.
__Leonard Please don't be upset. I just, I didn't want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.
__Penny Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn't have to be dating someone who's only a waitress.
__Leonard Oh, come on, you know that's not true.
__Penny Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?
__Leonard I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.
__Penny Yeah, well, next time don't. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker
__ and the Elves, okay? This is, Give a man a fish, he eats it. Teach a man to fish, he, sells it or something. Whatever, I don't know, it's just a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!
__Sheldon No. It would appear as if I've lost him. Stupid brain.
__Raj It'll be okay.
__Sheldon How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking's a genius and he talks like a robot. It's everything I've ever wanted in a friend.
__Raj Yeah, but if he's a sore loser, maybe you're better off without him.
__Sheldon You're right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.
__Howard So, now all you have to do is let him win.
__Sheldon Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.
__Howard What are you waiting for? Hit send.
__Sheldon I can't. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.
__Raj So don't do it.
__Sheldon Oh, but I want to be Hawking's friend.
__Howard So do it.
__Sheldon Oh, but if I do, I'll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.
__Raj Then don't do it.
__Sheldon I won't. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.
__Howard Good for you.
__Sheldon ‘Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.
__Penny Nope. I have no reason to… “B” mad at you. Minus.
__Leonard Wow.
__Penny That's right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.
__Leonard I don't know what to say.
__Penny Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you're smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I'm the one who learned a lesson. I'm so stupid, Penny. Duh.
__Sheldon She sounds exactly like you.
__Penny I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.
__Bernadette Good.
__Penny So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.
__Amy Understood.
__Bernadette Got it.
__Penny Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.
__Bernadette Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.
__Penny Believable? You saying I'm not smart?
__Bernadette No, no!
__Amy You're smart.
__Penny That's better.
__Amy I feel like I'm in high school again.
__Bernadette Yeah, doing the prom queen's homework so she'll like us.
__Leonard Well answer it. I want to hear.
__Sheldon Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.
__Stephen Hawking Hello. I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.
__Sheldon Oh, me, too.
__Stephen Hawking Or should I say Dr. Loser? Ha, ha, ha.
__Sheldon Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir.
__Stephen Hawking Do you like brain teasers?
__Sheldon Oh, I love brain teasers.
__Stephen Hawking What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck. Neener neener.
__Wil Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I'm happy to be here.
__Amy Cut.
__Sheldon What's wrong?
__Amy Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.
__Wil Wooden?
__Amy Don't worry, it wasn't terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.
__Sheldon My friend, Wil Wheaton.
__Wil Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.
__Sheldon So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
__Wil Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what's interesting about this flag…
__Amy Cut.
__Wil What was wrong with that?
__Amy It's called Fun with Flags. They're not at half-mast, nobody died. Let's try and keep it upbeat.
__Wil Um, no offence, but I've been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.
__Sheldon It's true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.
__Amy You'll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.
__Wil So do I.
__Amy Great. So, this time let's try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.
__Wil And cut. You realize that I'm doing this for free, right?
__Amy Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth. Let's try it again. Everybody's having fun. And action.
__Wil Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.
__Amy Cut.
__Wil Problem, first-time director?
__Sheldon Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.
__Amy He was overacting on purpose.
__Sheldon Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
__Wil Listen, Sheldon, I'm really happy to do this for you, but not if she's gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.
__Amy You gonna let him speak to me like that?
__Sheldon Well, you're my girlfriend and I don't want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend and I don't want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket.  What do you think?
__Amy Can I speak to you for a second?
__Sheldon I'll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.
__Amy I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.
__Sheldon Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He's a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.
__Amy Fine. Then maybe I should go.
__Sheldon Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I'll see you at dinner tonight?
__Amy You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
__Sheldon Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Don't take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
__Bernadette You ready to go?
__Howard Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.
__Bernadette I don't understand why you keep your stuff here when there's plenty of room at home.
__Howard What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there's my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?
__Bernadette 50 cents sounds right. Let's go.
__Howard You know, it's kinda late. Why don't we just spend the night here?
__Bernadette Because we don't live here.
__Howard I know.
__Bernadette Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.
__Howard That's not true.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, I'm doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?
__Howard There's some underwear in the hamper.
__Mrs Wolowitz Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.
__Howard Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you're getting at. How about this weekend I'll box up all my things and move them to our place.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__Howard The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.
__Bernadette Or in the closet. We can decide later.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, help, my hand's stuck in the garbage disposal.
__Howard Let go of whatever piece of food you're holding.
__Mrs Wolowitz Are you kidding? It's a perfectly good chicken leg.
__Sheldon I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.
__Leonard I thought you had plans with Amy.
__Sheldon Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.
__Leonard Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
__Sheldon Yes, quite the kerfuffle.
__Leonard Then Amy got mad and left?
__Sheldon Walked right out the door.
__Leonard And you?
__Sheldon Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
__Leonard Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
__Sheldon Why's that?
__Leonard Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.
__Sheldon You're just repeating what I said. It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
__Leonard Trust me, call her.
__Sheldon Fine. It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us, because the buffet you're about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.
__Amy What?
__Sheldon You'll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me. Tell him you're not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.
__Amy I'm mad at you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they're angry, they're really just hungry.
__Amy I'm not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn't do anything.
__Sheldon Precisely, I didn't do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?
__Leonard Keep going, buddy, you're doing great.
__Sheldon Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.
__Bernadette Kitchen slammed again?
__Penny No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?
__Bernadette So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?
__Howard Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.
__Bernadette What's your excuse this time?
__Howard No excuse. It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically, we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one's on God.
__Bernadette That might be a little more convincing if you didn't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
__Howard My religion's kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.
__Bernadette Howie, you promised you'd move.
__Howard And I will.
__Penny Yeah, right.
__Howard I will. I'm obviously not going to live in my mother's house for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.
__Penny I've seen her burp you.
__Howard She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don't you have other tables you should be waiting on?
__Penny Yeah, but I told you, I'm not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
__Bernadette I'm starting to think you're right.
__Howard All right, I've had enough of this. I'm a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I've been to space. I will move out when I'm ready, and I don't need anyone badgering me into it.
__Penny Wow, excuse me.
__Howard That was just for her benefit. I'll move tomorrow. I love you. Don't leave me.
__Amy What?
__Sheldon I've been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.
__Amy Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?
__Sheldon First of all, you're welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton's body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so.  Fine. I'll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy…  She's hooked.
__Howard Boy, if these walls could talk.
__Leonard They'd say, why does he touch himself so much?
__Howard Yeah. I can't believe I'm not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.
__Howard I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M'S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.
__Raj When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
__Howard Sometime around the third Almond Joy.
__Leonard Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
__Leonard We're not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.
__Howard Fine, let's go.
__Sheldon Penny, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have a conversation about girls.
__Penny I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
__Sheldon Penny, please, I'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.
__Penny And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?
__Sheldon Well, it's been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don't think that's going to cut it.
__Penny You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
__Sheldon Will that calm my nerves?
__Penny It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
__Sheldon Sold.
__Penny Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?
__Sheldon The trouble isn't with me, Penny, it's with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.
__Penny Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It'll warm her twaddle.
__Sheldon It's a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they're both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they're bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.
__Penny Honey, you can't make people like each other.
__Sheldon Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I'm having a tea party.
__Penny You might want to pace yourself.
__Sheldon I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I'm doing.
__Penny Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
__Sheldon My problem is I'm out of tea.
__Penny Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.
__Sheldon Penny, please, I think I've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.
__Penny Sorry.
__Sheldon On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.
__Penny Welcome to Long Island, Tex.
__Sheldon Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don't have to look at them. She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.
__Penny Yeah, that she is. Here you go.
__Sheldon I'm a callous egomaniac. She's gonna leave me.
__Penny No, she won't.
__Sheldon No, she won't. I'm great.
__Bernadette I know this wasn't easy. You doing okay?
__Howard Oh, I'm fine. It's just her I'm worried about.
__Bernadette Aw, she'll be okay. She's a grown woman.
__Howard I know. It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her.
__Bernadette That's a lot for a kid to deal with.
__Howard She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.
__Bernadette She's lucky you were there.
__Howard You know, she's why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she'd smile. For a few minutes, she'd forget how lonely she was.
__Bernadette Aw, crap. Let's go.
__Howard Where we going?
__Bernadette Grab a box. We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.
__Howard No, but I want to live here.
__Bernadette Well, you should've thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.
__Bernadette No husband of mine is gonna break his mother's heart!
__Wil Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
__Sheldon Wouldn't you like to know?
__Wil Have you been drinking?
__Sheldon Just tea. S'the best tea I've ever had.
__Wil Why are you here?
__Wil Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.
__Sheldon You insulted my woman. I'm here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.
__Wil Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we're gonna fight?
__Sheldon My fists are not up here because I'm milking a giant invisible cow. They're up to beat an apology out of you.
__Wil Okay, I'm sorry.
__Sheldon Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.
__Sheldon You're asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I'll choose.  You were so good in Stand by Me.
__LeVar Hey, Sheldon, it's a pleasure to be here. Well, we've got some interesting flags for…
__Sheldon I don't know what she's talking about, but I'm obligated to agree with her. She's my girlfriend.
__LeVar Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?
__Sheldon It's a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
__Howard Oh, you silly doodlebug.
__Leonard You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
__Sheldon It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down.
__Howard Do you expect me to build this?
__Sheldon I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
__Howard Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
__Leonard Really?
__Raj He probably just goes to the bathroom.
__Leonard Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.
__Raj It's sad that you know that.
__Leonard Oh, that's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
__Raj Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.
__Howard We should figure out where he goes.
__Raj Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.
__Leonard Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?
__Howard Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.
__Penny That sounds like fun.
__Leonard Yeah, it was.
__Penny Oh, good, I guessed right.
__Leonard Who you talking to?
__Penny Oh, just this guy I met at school.
__Leonard Oh, great. We're still dating, right?
__Penny Relax. He's just a friend. We're doing an oral report together. He's really nice.
__Leonard I'm sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.
__Penny Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn't really know anybody.
__Leonard Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.
__Penny No. That's not true. There's French, there's Italian. No, you're right, it's the best.
__Leonard Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
__Penny It didn't come up.
__Leonard Well, maybe you should tell him.
__Penny What am I supposed to say?
__Leonard Say, can't talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.
__Penny Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
__Leonard Yes. Thank you.
__Penny Mm-hmm. Hmm.
__Leonard What did he say?
__Penny Nothing.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Did your boyfriend make you type that?
__Leonard I hate this guy.
__Penny Don't be like that.
__Leonard Come on, trust me, he's hitting on you.
__Penny No, he's not. We're just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he's supposed to come over tomorrow to work.
__Leonard Really? Here?
__Penny If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll switch partners, even though the thing's due next week and everyone already has a partner and I'll probably end up failing the class.
__Leonard That'd be great. Thank you.
__Sheldon Oh, hello.
__Howard Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?
__Sheldon No, thank you.
__Raj Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it's like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
__Sheldon I'm quite sure. Good day.
__Howard Well, where are you going?
__Sheldon Where are you going?
__Raj We just told you.
__Sheldon I just told you.
__Howard No, you didn't.
__Sheldon Well, it's your word against mine; see you in court.
__Howard Should we follow him?
__Raj I don't know, I'm torn. I want to know where he's going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.
__Alex Hi, guys.
__Howard Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?
__Alex No.
__Howard Don't you know his schedule?
__Alex All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.
__Howard Come on.
__Raj Boy, what I wouldn't give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.
__Raj I think it's an old storage room.
__Howard What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
__Raj Well, he's not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?
__Howard Not yet. What are you doing?
__Raj I'm listening.
__Howard Can't you face the other way and listen?
__Howard What the hell is he up to?
__Raj He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
__Howard Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?
__Raj Howard, please, you can't treat the man differently just because he's disabled. That's not okay.
__Sheldon To be honest, I didn't know you were here.
__Leonard It's not a big deal. He's just in her history class. They're working on a project together. I don't even know why I care. You know what, I don't care.
__Sheldon You think you don't care?
__Leonard This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
__Sheldon Oh, I don't know. I mean, statistically speaking, I'm sure you have something to worry about.
__Leonard What do you mean?
__Sheldon Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That's one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.
__Leonard Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks. I'm, I'm way above average in a lot of other things.
__Sheldon Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
__Sheldon You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
__Leonard I liked it better when you thought I wasn't here.
__Sheldon I'm not saying you don't have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you're a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You're a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.
__Leonard None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.
__Sheldon Well, unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon While unlikely, it's still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.
__Leonard Now you're just being ridiculous.
__Sheldon Am I? The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she's a chicken pecking for corn.
__Howard I think we're more like ninjas.
__Raj I don't want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.
__Howard Fine, I'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
__Raj No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we're ninjas.
__Howard Thank you.
__Raj But next time, we'll be cat burglars.
__Howard It's locked.
__Raj Are you sure?
__Raj It's locked.
__Howard Just keep an eye out. I'll have this open in a minute.
__Raj When did you learn how to pick locks?
__Howard When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.
__Raj How did that work out?
__Howard Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?
__Raj Hold on, hold on.
__Howard What?
__Raj Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.
__Howard Yeah, so?
__Raj What if it's booby-trapped?
__Howard Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.
__Raj Great, what's your pl…
__Howard Are we good?
__Raj Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
__Howard I don't know. The solution to an equation?
__Raj Maybe. It's a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
__Howard What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?
__Raj He's always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
__Raj Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.
__Penny Thanks, Cole. See you at school.
__Cole See you.
__Leonard I'll be right back.
__Sheldon I thought you left a long time ago.
__Leonard ‘sup?
__Leonard You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
__Cole No, I was just visiting a friend.
__Leonard Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?
__Cole Yeah. You know her?
__Leonard I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.
__Cole Really?
__Leonard Yeah. He's ganged up.
__Cole She told me he's a scientist.
__Leonard That's the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.
__Cole Well, thanks for the tip.
__Leonard No problem, brother. Stay frosty.  We're still dating, right?
__Leonard Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I'm pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter's degree was honorary.
__Alex May I join you, Leonard?
__Leonard Sure.
__Alex Thanks.
__Leonard Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He's got an English accent.
__Alex Ooh, I love English accents.
__Leonard Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he's hitting on her. She says he's just being nice and that I should trust her.
__Alex It's probably harmless. You know how it is. I'm sure you get hit on all the time.
__Leonard Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.
__Alex I don't know, I bet it happens more than you realize.
__Leonard Trust me, it doesn't.
__Alex You sure? You're cute, you're funny. Maybe you're getting hit on, and you don't even know it.
__Leonard Really?
__Alex Yep, pretty sure.
__Leonard Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.
__Alex No problem.
__Leonard Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
__Howard Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom's neck size.
__Raj It's the atomic number for technetium.
__Howard That stuff's radioactive.
__Raj Do you think he's building a bomb?
__Howard Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I'm not worried.
__Raj Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.
__Howard Why would you know that?
__Raj I'm sorry. We can't all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, isn't forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?
__Howard That's forty-two, dumb-ass.
__Raj Hey, hey. Feelings.
__Howard We should stop. I'm exhausted.
__Raj Yeah, me, too. We've got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?
__Howard Not me.
__Raj Let's go home. You want to get something to eat?
__Howard Sounds good.
__Raj What the balls is forty-three?
__Howard I have to know!
__Penny Hey, shouldn't you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?
__Leonard Come on, I'm sorry.
__Penny I just can't believe you don't trust me.
__Leonard I do, of course I do.
__Penny Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?
__Leonard Really?
__Penny Your picture's on my refrigerator.
__Leonard Oh. You know, I'm really starting to not like this guy.
__Penny What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
__Leonard I don't know. It-it-it's hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I'm standing right there. And they're all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It's my problem, not yours.
__Penny Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you're the one I'm with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you're driving me crazy.
__Leonard You know that's the first time you ever said that you love me.
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard We're just supposed to pretend it's not a big deal?
__Penny That's exactly what we're gonna do because you're about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you're gonna start crying.
__Leonard You're right, you should go.
__Penny All right.
__Leonard She loves me.  Hey, it's Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I'm always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.
__Raj That's good quality video.
__Howard It better be. It's the spare camera for the Mars rover.
__Raj How did you get your hands on that?
__Howard Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.
__Raj Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.
__Howard What the hell is that thing?
__Raj I don't know.
__Sheldon This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.
__Howard Wormhole generator test?
__Sheldon The first forty-three parallel universes I've checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different.
__Howard Oh, my God!
__Raj Holy crap!
__Sheldon Oh! It's eating my face!
__Raj Aah! It's eating his face!
__Sheldon I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
__Raj Sheldon, we're really sorry.
__Howard Yeah, really sorry.
__Sheldon Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It's exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.
__Howard But what are you doing in there?
__Raj And what does forty-three mean?
__Sheldon You don't need to know, you don't deserve to know, and you will never know.
__Raj Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.
__Leonard Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You're just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
__Raj No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.
__Leonard Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.
__Raj That's called a fashion choice.
__Leonard All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.
__Leonard Good boy. Here's a cookie.
__Sheldon Oh, thank you.
__Howard Hey, fellas, what's going on?
__Leonard Oh, mummies and zombies again.
__Howard Oh, they're not the same thing.
__Leonard You get a cookie, too.
__Howard Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?
__Raj Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, 294?
__Howard Yeah.
__Sheldon That's my parking spot.
__Raj Why do you have a parking spot? You don't have a car. You don't even drive.
__Sheldon It doesn't matter. That's my spot.
__Leonard Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.
__Howard Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I'm sure they'll give you another parking space.
__Sheldon I don't want another parking space. I want my parking space. It's perfect. It's a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.
__Howard Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.
__Sheldon Don't try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.
__Howard Are you listening to yourself?
__Sheldon I always listen to myself. It's one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.
__Howard Nope.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Well, he's not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.
__Sheldon Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?
__Leonard Sheldon, let it go. It's not a big deal.
__Sheldon No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It's like my dad always said, first they say you can't drink and drive, next thing you know, you can't let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.
__Leonard All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
__Sheldon Leonard, you're my best friend. Why don't you ever take my side?
__Leonard Because I can never understand your side.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, but could you be more specific?
__Howard My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.
__Sheldon Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren't using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn't it?
__Howard Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.
__Sheldon I'd love to help you out, but unfortunately , I'm using it.
__Howard Fine. I'm taking your diploma.
__Penny Yeah. So, how you doing?
__Amy A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?
__Penny Uh, no, they usually don't have to go out and get more wax.
__Amy I feel like I'm five pounds lighter.
__Bernadette Really? Only five?
__Penny Hey, anybody want a drink?
__Bernadette Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?
__Amy For hours. Fortunately, I couldn't understand most of it 'cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.
__Bernadette Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
__Amy I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they're bound to lock horns.
__Penny I'm assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?
__Bernadette I'm really sorry they took Sheldon's spot away. He shouldn't have to suffer just because Howard's such a big deal now.
__Amy I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.
__Bernadette What's that supposed to mean?
__Amy Well, I mean, Howard's never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.
__Bernadette You're right. And I'm sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.
__Amy If and when?
__Penny Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?
__Bernadette Hang on. None of Sheldon's theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.
__Amy That's an impressive accomplishment. He's now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don't have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
__Penny You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It's a bad idea.
__Penny Damn.
__Amy Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.
__Penny Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.
__Bernadette I don't have to take this. I'm gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I'll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn't mean it that way,
__Leonard Sheldon?
__Sheldon Cookie.
__Leonard I don't have any.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not giving it away.
__Howard Hi Sheldon.
__Sheldon He's in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.
__Leonard Howard, what are you doing?
__Howard He wasn't using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
__Sheldon Get off there.
__Howard Give me back my Iron Man helmet.
__Sheldon Give me back my parking space.
__Howard You don't need a parking space. You don't have a car.
__Sheldon You don't need an Iron Man helmet. You're not Iron Man.
__Howard Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.
__Raj I didn't pick up on that. That's a nice touch.
__Leonard Mmm.
__Sheldon Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.
__Amy Freaking pigs.
__Sheldon Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let's get out of here.
__Amy Wait, I'm leaving my car here?
__Sheldon Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.
__Amy Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.
__Sheldon All right, colour me intrigued.
__Amy What do you think?
__Sheldon I think you're high on paint fumes. And boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.
__Bernadette What can I tell ya? She's a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?
__Penny No, Leonard's taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee'll just keep me awake.  Oh, I'll get it.
__Amy Oh, looks like someone's on Team Bernadette. Where's Howard?
__Bernadette He's not here. What's wrong?
__Amy He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
__Bernadette Oh, no. Where was it parked?
__Amy In Sheldon's spot.
__Bernadette That doesn't make sense. Sheldon doesn't have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard's spot?
__Amy Don't play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.
__Bernadette Well, that doesn't make sense, either.
__Amy Why not?
__Bernadette Because I'm the one who had it towed.
__Amy You?
__Bernadette Didn't see that one coming, did ya?
__Amy Oh, yeah? Well, you're not gonna see this coming.
__Penny Ow! Ow!
__Amy Oh, my God,
__Bernadette Are you okay?!
__Amy Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I've been meaning to take to the bank.
__Bernadette Don't move. I'll get some ice.
__Amy Are you okay?
__Penny Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what's left of your pubes!
__Bernadette Here.
__Penny Thanks. Ah!
__Bernadette Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?
__Penny Gee, you think?
__Amy I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.
__Bernadette You hit her! What did I do?
__Amy You had my car towed.
__Bernadette You were parked in Howard's spot.
__Amy I was parked in Sheldon's spot.
__Bernadette Sheldon doesn't have a spot.
__Penny Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.
__Bernadette Okay, let's go.
__Amy I'll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
__Bernadette The tow truck didn't scratch your car.
__Amy How do you know?
__Bernadette ‘Cause I did it!
__Howard What the hell are you doing?
__Howard Okay, you need to move now.
__Sheldon No, I don't.
__Howard You can't stay there forever.
__Sheldon Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You've chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can't defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to…
__Howard Those aren't gonna help you, Sheldon,
__Sheldon Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?
__Howard I'm warning you, Sheldon!
__Sheldon Your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  Stop that.
__Howard Get out of my spot.
__Leonard What are you idiots doing?
__Sheldon He's trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.
__Howard Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
__Leonard You're both acting like lunatics. It's just a parking spot.
__Howard It's not just a parking spot. He can't handle the fact that I'm a bigger deal than he is now.
__Sheldon Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university's six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
__Howard Can you believe this guy?
__Leonard What I don't believe is that you tried to run him over.
__Howard Oh, like you've never thought of doing that. Don't hate me just because I lived the dream. (Horn beeps. Sheldon is sitting naked in Howard's car.)
__Sheldon Hey, sweet ride.
__Howard What are you doing in there?
__Sheldon Just breaking in your new car.
__Howard Stop that. You stop that.
__Raj Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.
__Howard All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…
__Raj Howard, that's not how we practiced it.
__Howard I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it's not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I'll park in the structure across the street.
__Sheldon Well, Howard, thank you. It's quite a gesture on your part. You've shown yourself to be the bigger man.
__Howard Thank you.
__Sheldon Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.
__Howard Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don't know what to say.
__Sheldon There is nothing to say. Except I'm the bigger man. I'm not kidding. Say it.
__Raj Just say it.
__Howard You're the bigger man, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.
__Sheldon To burying the hatchet.
__Bernadette You know, I'm kind of glad this happened.
__Amy Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.
__Penny Yeah, everybody's happy, great.
__Sheldon Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.
__Shopkeeper A what?
__Sheldon A naked man sat on it. Now, here's my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?
__Shopkeeper Lipid what?
__Sheldon Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.
__Shopkeeper Tuesday okay?
__Sheldon Don't rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
__Shopkeeper Let me write you a ticket.
__Sheldon Is that your son?
__Sheldon Looks like that laptop's seen better days. If you're interested, I'm selling this. It's only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut's penis.
__Leonard Why would it trouble you? It's, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.
__Sheldon It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.
__Howard and Raj Turtle power!
__Sheldon However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.
__Howard Yeah, so?
__Sheldon I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.
__Raj an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
__Howard It's heebie-jeebies.
__Raj I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.
__Leonard Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.
__Raj Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie's bad when my homegirl Sandy B can't save it.
__Leonard Penny's working tonight, I'm in.
__Howard Not me. I'm having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.
__Leonard Fun. We know how much you love that.
__Howard It's torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.
__Sheldon You know what I like to do when I'm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.
__Howard Thanks, Sheldon. I'll try that with my father-in-law.
__Sheldon No, you can't use that one. That's mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.
__Howard Great, thank you.
__Sheldon Actually, you can't have that one either. It's too good. Sorry.
__Raj What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?
__Sheldon Sadly, yes. Amy's taking me to a memorial service. It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he'll never make his way back to China.
__Leonard That should lighten the mood.
__Sheldon What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy Hello, Sheldon.
__Sheldon I'm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?
__Amy I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.
__Sheldon You're sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.
__Amy Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?
__Sheldon Me? No. No, I'm not that kind of doctor.
__Amy But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.
__Sheldon Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill. When you're feeling better, you'll think that's funny.
__Amy Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Amy.  Amy.  Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.
__Amy Thank you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You're welcome. Now let's get this over with.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Fine.
__Howard Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?
__Howard I'm sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How's that dinner coming?
__Bernadette I just put it in. It's gonna be a while.
__Howard I like rare chicken. Let's do this.
__Bernadette You could die.
__Howard Death by chicken. That's a pretty fowl way to go.
__Mrs. Rostenkowski Here's another beer, honey.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Thank you.
__Mrs. Rostenkowski It was good.
__Howard Had no idea you were the chatty one.
__Amy Sheldon, you don't get over the flu in half an hour.
__Sheldon Well, not with that attitude.
__Amy I have to say, I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?
__Amy Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.
__Sheldon Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.
__Amy Sheldon, this isn't helping. Why don't you just let me get some rest.
__Amy You, you want to rub something on my chest?
__Sheldon Yes. All over it.
__Amy Maybe we should start with that.
__Sheldon Now you're being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.
__Amy Oh, I'm counting on it.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.
__Howard Took the words right out of my mouth.
__Bernadette So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?
__Mr. Rostenkowski I'm going next weekend.
__Howard Oh, you like to fish?
__Mr. Rostenkowski Yes.
__Howard Sure. I can hear it in your voice.
__Mrs. Rostenkowski Oh, if he didn't like it, he wouldn't go.
__Howard You know, I hadn't thought of that.  Help me.
__Bernadette Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.
__Howard No, no. We know each other well enough. He's been talking my ear off all night.
__Bernadette Howie, I think you'd have fun.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Fine, you can tag along.
__Bernadette Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin'.
__Howard Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.
__Bernadette What thing?
__Howard You know, the thing.
__Bernadette Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.
__Mr. Rostenkowski All right, it's settled. You and I are going fishing.
__Howard Great.  Thanks for the help.
__Raj If you don't want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I'll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.
__Leonard Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.
__Howard Do either of you guys know how to fish?
__Leonard No.
__Raj No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.
__Howard Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.
__Howard Ew!
__Penny Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you're not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It's right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.
__Howard Really?
__Penny You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.
__Howard Okay.
__Penny What are you waiting for?
__Howard I don't know, for them to die of natural causes.
__Penny Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
__Howard Fine. There.
__Leonard I'm no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.
__Howard Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.
__Penny Hey, don't name him. Just jab a hook in his face.
__Raj You got this, buddy.
__Leonard Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.
__Amy That was great. Rub my chest again.
__Sheldon No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up.
__Bernadette How's the poor thing?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.
__Bernadette Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there's a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.
__Sheldon Uh, I'm going to draw you a soothing bath. Where's your bath thermometer?
__Amy I don't have a bath thermometer.
__Sheldon Fine. Then I'm going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
__Bernadette This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
__Amy Okay, okay, here's the deal. I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.
__Bernadette I don't understand.
__Amy I got better two days ago. It's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.
__Bernadette So you've just been lying to him?
__Amy See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.
__Bernadette I don't mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.
__Amy All right. I'll tell him.
__Sheldon Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?
__Amy I'll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.
__Howard No, I'm fine. Keep going.
__Penny All right. Now, you don't want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.  Oh, my God. What is with you guys?
__Leonard It's not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.
__Penny What, never?
__Leonard My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.
__Raj Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.
__Howard Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.
__Raj Yeah, okay, Howard wins.
__Leonard You know, maybe we didn't have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there's a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.
__Howard You're right. Oh! I should do this.
__Penny Great. Here you go. What you're going to do is you're going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.
__Howard Here we go. Oh!
__Penny Oh, look, it's a female. You can see all the eggs.
__Sheldon I'm surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren't recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.
__Amy Oh?
__Sheldon I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.
__Amy All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It's just been so nice having you take care of me.
__Sheldon It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.
__Amy I feel terrible I did this.
__Sheldon It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.
__Amy I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?
__Sheldon In a perfect world, I'd lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.
__Amy I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
__Sheldon Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn't kill a man. You know, it's a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.
__Amy Are you saying you want to spank me?
__Sheldon I don't want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.
__Amy That's true. I've been a very bad girl.
__Mr. Rostenkowski That's what you're wearing?
__Howard No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Maybe in cartoons.
__Howard Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.
__Mr. Rostenkowski All right, let's hit the road. I wouldn't mind shooting some ducks in the morning.
__Howard Wait, now we're shooting things?
__Mr. Rostenkowski I like using a big shell. You can't eat them afterwards, but it's fun watching them blow up.
__Mr. Rostenkowski So, why'd you agree to come?
__Howard ‘Cause Bernadette made me.
__Mr. Rostenkowski I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.
__Howard Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You're a big, scary cop.
__Mr. Rostenkowski You're an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she's only four feet tall.
__Howard So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Ah. There's an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?
__Howard No, but I'm not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Mazel tov. I'll teach you how to play.
__Howard Really? Thank you, sir.
__Mr. Rostenkowski Call me Mike.
__Howard Okay. Oh, boy, we're just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?
__Mr. Rostenkowski That's my wife and daughter you're talking about.
__Howard Great couple of gals.
__Amy One second. I want to put on some music.
__Sheldon Why?
__Amy I don't want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
__Sheldon Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let's begin.
__Amy Oh, my.
__Sheldon Excuse me. You're not supposed to be enjoying this.
__Amy Then maybe you should spank me harder.
__Sheldon Maybe I will.
__Amy Ooh!
__Leonard Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.
__Penny You're so butch.
__Leonard Aw, I got a little paper cut.
__Penny Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.
__Leonard Oh, before I forget, Saturday I'm planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.
__Penny Really? That's how you're gonna spend your Saturday night?
__Leonard Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.
__Penny Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?
__Leonard Little bit, yeah.
__Sheldon Yeah, oh, I'm sorry. I should've mentioned this earlier. You're not invited.
__Amy Why not?
__Sheldon Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.
__Amy By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
__Sheldon Yeah, like a bunch of savages.
__Howard But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I'm not there, then everyone will blame you. They'll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She's the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.
__Bernadette You're an idiot.
__Howard I'm your idiot. Forever.
__Stuart Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon A Christmas gift? You know I don't enjoy Christmas.
__Stuart What's wrong with Christmas?
__Sheldon Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words 'tis and 'twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?
__Howard Pirate with a peg leg?
__Sheldon Actually that helps, thank you.
__Leonard Would you just look inside?
__Sheldon Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They're my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that's a saucy twist. That leader's name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.
__Leonard It's actually ho, ho, ho, but you'll get the hang of it. Thought it'd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.
__Sheldon Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.
__Leonard Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa's village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.
__Raj Oh, man, the first monster I see, I'm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.
__Stuart Do you hear yourself when you say these things?
__Sheldon I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
__Leonard Fine. Howard, what do you do?
__Howard I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.
__Leonard And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
__Howard Okay, guys, let's make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.
__Raj No, screw that noise, I'm going in. Hang on, Santa, I'm coming for you.
__Leonard Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you're out of the game.
__Raj But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?
__Sheldon Lucky.
__Leonard Okay, come on, moving on.
__Raj Wait, doesn't anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you've got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.
__Stuart Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.
__Penny Hey, guys. I don't mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you'd like to see what you're missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette's wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there's Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I'm assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.
__Sheldon I know they're making a rhetorical point, I just don't know what it is.
__Penny See you, boys. We are going drinking.
__Raj Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died.
__Bernadette Sorry, Raj, it's girls' night out.
__Amy Maybe another time.
__Leonard Okay…
__Penny Come on.
__Raj Ooh! Girls' night, girls' night! Ooh! Ooh!
__Stuart How does he not hear that?
__Bernadette No!
__Penny No!
__Amy Geez, who's Forever 63 now?
__Raj Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don't worry. It's my treat.
__Amy Thanks.
__Penny Wow, you should come to girls' night more often. And not just because if you weren't here, this would be a can of Pabst.
__Raj My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she's going to die of gout.
__Bernadette Hey, let's help Raj meet a girl tonight.
__Raj No, no, no, I'm fine.
__Amy Let's get him laid!
__Raj Stop it. You're ruining girls' night.
__Penny Raj, you're a great guy, you're in a bar full of single women, let us help you.
__Bernadette Yeah, you're a real catch. I know you're shy, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have someone wonderful in your life.
__Raj That's sweet of you. But what can you do to help?
__Bernadette We'll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.
__Raj Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don't tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.
__Raj Okay, an eight is acceptable if she's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.
__Bernadette Bottom line, you'll take any woman who'll have you, right?
__Raj In a New Delhi minute.
__Leonard Oh, uh, yeah. I got 'em on Amazon.
__Stuart Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?
__Leonard I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.
__Stuart Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.
__Howard Can we please move this along?
__Leonard Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.
__Howard Excuse me, I'm a married man now. I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.
__Leonard Great. What do you do?
__Howard I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”
__Leonard It's locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.
__Stuart That's not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.
__Leonard Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.
__Howard Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?
__Leonard Walls are getting closer.
__Stuart Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.
__Sheldon Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.
__Leonard You're ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.
__Howard What are we supposed to do?
__Leonard Seven, six.
__Sheldon Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.
__Howard Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.
__Leonard Three, two.
__Stuart Somebody sing the damn song.
__Sheldon Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay 'round about, deep and crisp and even
__Leonard The walls are getting slower.
__Sheldon Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.
__Leonard The walls stop. You're safe.
__Howard That was amazing, Sheldon.
__Stuart How did you know that?
__Sheldon It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.
__Leonard Okay, continuing our quest.
__Sheldon W-W-Wait. There's still four more verses. You don't sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know'st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…
__Penny Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She's angry, she's drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.
__Amy That is some low-hanging fruit.
__Bernadette Oh, here he comes.
__Penny So, how'd it go?
__Raj Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.
__Penny Ooh!
__Bernadette Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
__Raj What?
__Bernadette I'm sorry, Raj.
__Penny Oh, honey, it's not you, it's them.
__Raj No, it's not. She was too beautiful for me.
__Bernadette Why would you say that?
__Raj It's true. I'm always attracted to women I can't have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.
__Amy The two of them? I don't understand.
__Raj Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.
__Amy And you liked Bernadette also?
__Raj That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends' girlfriends at a time. I'm very old-fashioned that way.
__Amy So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.
__Raj No, not really.
__Penny Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
__Bernadette Think harder.
__Raj Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn't, I mean, at all. What?
__Howard Done?
__Sheldon I think the word you're looking for is bravo.
__Leonard Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
__Sheldon Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
__Leonard I don't know. What's the difference?
__Sheldon Well it's a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.
__Leonard Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
__Leonard You see those, too.
__Sheldon Oh, it's like I'm really there.
__Stuart I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I've had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.
__Howard Good story.
__Leonard What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?
__Sheldon Yes. What, is there a problem?
__Leonard No, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.
__Sheldon Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year 'round. I've been known to enjoy this poolside.
__Leonard Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you've got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You're getting a little Yuletide spirit.
__Sheldon Oh, don't be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?
__Leonard Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.
__Stuart What was so bad about them?
__Leonard I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there because the paper would be graded.
__Sheldon No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.
__Leonard It wasn't amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.
__Sheldon Yeah, I'm familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.
__Amy It's fine. I'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn't have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I'd give him back his insulin.
__Bernadette Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.
__Amy Forget it. I don't expect you guys to understand.
__Amy You think that's bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.
__Raj Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I'm holding hands with another person.
__Amy I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.
__Raj It's kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
__Amy It is, isn't it?
__Raj But you're not alone anymore. Now you've got Sheldon.
__Amy I do. And don't worry, someday you'll have somebody, too.
__Raj Thank you. I hope she's half as lovely and amazing as you are.
__Amy Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I'm good. We can go now.
__Raj Damn it.
__Penny What?
__Raj Now that I know she doesn't like me, I'm kind of into her.
__Howard Great. Let's do it.
__Leonard The drawbridge is lowering.
__Sheldon Play through the pain.
__Leonard You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.
__Howard Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don't ever tell my mother I said that.
__Stuart I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.
__Sheldon But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.
__Howard Wait, what are you doing?
__Sheldon You can't talk, you're paralyzed. I get right up in Santa's big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn't that right?
__Leonard Uh, okay.
__Sheldon My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.
__Leonard This is weird, right?
__Sheldon Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn't bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain't one of 'em. And now you're here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today's not your day. I'm leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!
__Leonard Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa's dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.
__Santa Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.
__Sheldon Well, then, you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots.
__Santa Oh. I've been wanting to talk to you. I'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.
__Sheldon I understand.
__Santa But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.
__Sheldon Oh, I hope it's a train.
__Santa Oh, it's better than a train.
__Sheldon Two trains?
__Santa Better.
__Sheldon I'm getting three trains.
__Santa Okay, open 'em. (It's a cannon, pointed at Sheldon) This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!
__Sheldon Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense…
__Santa Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork.
__Leonard I can't blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.
__Sheldon No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I've never felt so alive.  Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night's recordings.
__Sheldon Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.
__Alex Hey, Leonard.
__Leonard Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.
__Alex Oh, I know, I'm the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?
__Leonard Well, most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we're done. How about you?
__Alex Oh, I'm gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.
__Leonard Ooh. That's his take on John Wheeler's quantum foam. That should be great.
__Alex Well, if you want, you can come with me.
__Leonard Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny.
__Alex Well, bring her.
__Leonard Well, she's not really into that kind of stuff.
__Alex Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Jenga, I win!
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig'em the Frog, Cap'n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It's a total breakfast sausage fest.
__Leonard Are we done with this?
__Raj Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.
__Leonard Terrific. Something weird happened and I don't know what to do about it.
__Howard What's going on?
__Raj How could you do that to me? You know I've been working it with Alex for weeks.
__Leonard Working it? You can't even talk to her.
__Raj I talk with my eyes.
__Howard You look like my little cousin when he's dropping one in his diaper.
__Leonard She knows I have a girlfriend. It's so weird.
__Raj Oh, my God. You're loving this.
__Leonard To my bones. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.
__Raj I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
__Sheldon Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?
__Raj Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.
__Leonard I didn't steal anyone.
__Raj Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
__Sheldon Well, that's not acceptable. I mean, I'm her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.
__Leonard I'm androgynous?
__Sheldon Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.
__Leonard What do you guys think I should do?
__Raj I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.
__Penny What is happening?
__Sheldon I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I'll be changing their names.
__Bernadette Who's involved?
__Sheldon Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let's call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.
__Penny You're talking about Leonard.
__Sheldon No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.
__Amy It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?
__Sheldon No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.
__Penny Wait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?
__Sheldon No, uh, no, I'm sorry. Who's talking about Leonard and Alex?
__Penny Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.
__Sheldon Okay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he's usually pretty smart about these things.
__Penny I'm gonna kill her.
__Bernadette I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.
__Amy She's right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.
__Sheldon Ladies, ladies, please. We're not here to talk about Penny, okay? We're here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat's out of the bag. Let me explain what's going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.
__Penny We know what's going on, Sheldon!
__Sheldon Well, what should I do?
__Bernadette Well, Alex is your employee. If she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.
__Sheldon Oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all. No, he's loving it. Yeah, he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six.
__Penny What? He's loving it?
__Bernadette Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.
__Sheldon Talk to her? That's all you've got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.
__Alex I think it's pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here's something at four o'clock. Give Alex a talking to?
__Sheldon Well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?
__Alex Is there a problem?
__Sheldon Let's not call it a problem. Let's call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.
__Alex What did I do?
__Sheldon You don't know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don't even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.
__Alex What? I didn't make a sexual advance on anybody.
__Sheldon Now, there's no need to get defensive. I'm not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.
__Alex What?
__Sheldon Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
__Alex This conversation is making me uncomfortable.
__Sheldon Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don't hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you're a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let's see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.
__Alex I have to go.
__Sheldon So does this fellow, but he can't without it burning like hot soup.
__Penny Oh, you seem extra happy.
__Leonard Uh, I guess I am.
__Penny Any particular reason why?
__Leonard I don't know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.
__Penny Mm-hmm. Anything else?
__Leonard Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.
__Leonard Oh. It. Was.
__Penny Hmm. Well, I'm glad you're having such a great day.
__Leonard Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
__Penny Oh, and who's that?
__Leonard What do you mean?
__Penny Oh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex.
__Leonard Um, why would I mean Alex?
__Penny Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!
__Sheldon Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.
__Leonard Why would you do that?
__Sheldon I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.
__Leonard At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
__Sheldon Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.  Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.
__Leonard Oh, my God, what did you do?
__Sheldon Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I'm a delight.
__HR Woman Come in.
__Sheldon Hello.
__HR Woman Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__HR Woman I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.
__Sheldon So I've been told. But I can't understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.
__HR Woman Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.
__Sheldon Like what?
__HR Woman Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.
__Sheldon Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You're a slave.
__HR Woman I'm a what?
__Sheldon Well, y-you, I-I'm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle…
__HR Woman Whuh-ah! Woah! You can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.
__Sheldon I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.
__HR Woman Hofstadter… Wolowitz… and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?
__Sheldon Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn't racist. He's also brown.
__Penny Oh, damn it, you are.
__Penny I don't care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?
__Leonard Of course not. No. Why?
__Penny Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.
__Leonard You do that?
__Penny No.
__Leonard Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.
__Penny Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?
__Leonard No, I'm not happy.
__Penny Why are you smiling?
__Leonard I'm sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.
__Penny Well, I do.
__Leonard Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.
__Leonard Come here. Tell you a secret?
__Penny What's that?
__Leonard With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.
__Penny Can I tell you a secret?
__Leonard Sure.
__Penny Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop.
__Penny What did you do?
__Leonard I don't know.
__Bernadette Why?
__Howard I don't know.
__Raj How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
__Howard I don't know. Seek professional help?
__Raj I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
__Howard Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?
__Leonard Sheldon threw us all under the bus.
__Howard Oh.
__Raj I feel like I've been called down to the principal's office. Although I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.
__Howard Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.
__Raj Well, this is all your fault.
__Leonard How is this my fault?
__Raj If you weren't screwing around with Sheldon's assistant, none of this would be happening.
__Leonard I wasn't screwing around with anyone.
__Raj Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.
__HR Woman Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it's been a while.
__Howard Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?
__Janine Fine. You must be Dr. Hofstadter.
__Leonard Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.
__Raj Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn't do anything.
__Janine Is that alcohol on your breath?
__Raj Howard built a sex robot.
__Howard That is not true. All I did was build a robot.
__Janine Did it have six breasts?
__Sheldon Well, hello.
__Leonard What are you doing here?
__Sheldon Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.
__Janine And I'm a little busy right now.
__Sheldon But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
__Janine And who was that?
__Sheldon You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I'm deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.
__Janine That's it. All of you, in my office now!
__Sheldon And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you're menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don't have to.
__Alex Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
__Sheldon Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.
__Sheldon Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I'm gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you'd better ace it, they're pretty mad.
__Leonard Oh, would you stop worrying about that?
__Penny I can't help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.
__Leonard That's great.
__Penny No, it isn't, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don't need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.
__Leonard Glasses? I really don't think that's gonna change… oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.
__Penny I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.
__Leonard Okay, come with me.
__Penny Where are we going?
__Leonard To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.
__Sheldon Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.
__Penny Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
__Penny Damn, you've got more makeup than I do. You've got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I'm borrowing this.
__Leonard Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.
__Sheldon That's a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister's makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.
__Penny I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
__Leonard That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
__Penny Is that better?
__Leonard Well, it's a lot smaller. It's more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.
__Sheldon So to answer your question, no, it's not better.
__Penny Well, then why are you going?
__Sheldon It's a comic book convention. You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one's still pretty good.
__Penny All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Oh, hang on a second. (Hands her the day's newspaper) Hold this.
__Penny What was that for?
__Leonard To show people when they don't believe me.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch. He can't stand being at a table where one person's having an omelette and another person's having a sandwich.
__Bernadette He's not exhausting at all.
__Penny Oh. It's Leonard. He says they're on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it's the mimosa, but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.
__Bernadette It's cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
__Amy When did Howard learn to sew?
__Bernadette When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom's pants out.
__Amy I don't even understand why they go to these conventions.
__Penny I know. The four of them work at a major university. They're all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
__Bernadette I don't mind it. I think Howie's just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I'm touching his inner child.
__Amy It's probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can't fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.
__Penny Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn't have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.
__Bernadette I've never even read a comic book. You guys?
__Penny Uh-uh.
__Amy No.
__Bernadette I mean, it's such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.
__Amy Seriously?
__Bernadette The comic book store isn't far from here.
__Penny That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?
__Leonard It is on.
__Sheldon But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on. I know I'd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.
__Howard Has it really only been ten miles?
__Leonard I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.
__GPS GPS (in Sheldon's voice): Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.
__Sheldon Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about. I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.
__Leonard What did you do?
__Sheldon I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
__Raj That is so cool.
__Leonard Counterpoint, no, it's not.
__GPS Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here's an interesting fact about interstates.
__Leonard Really?
__Sheldon Shh, he said it's interesting.
__GPS Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.
__Howard Look, Leonard, there's a bridge. Drive off it.
__Raj You know, we're not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
__Sheldon Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.
__Howard We've got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.
__Raj Great idea. I haven't had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.
__Leonard Yeah, that sounds fun.
__Sheldon Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.
__GPS Recalculating. While we're waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.
__Sheldon None of you will get it. It's Eisenhower.
__Amy Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.
__Stuart Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They're just girls. It's nothing you haven't seen in movies or in drawings.
__Penny Hey, Stuart.
__Bernadette We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
__Stuart Oh, well, I recommend you don't open a store and sell them.
__Penny No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we'd give it a try.
__Stuart Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga… I swear I will turn a hose on you.
__Bernadette What kind of comics do the guys like?
__Stuart Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.
__Amy All right, well, who's the best superhero?
__Stuart Shh! You can't ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?
__Penny Well then, what do you recommend?
__Stuart Well, uh, let's see. You've got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.
__Amy Ooh, I do love a bad boy.
__Penny As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
__Stuart If I were you, I'd go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it's intelligently written, and it doesn't objectify or stereotype women.
__Penny Ooh, Thor! He's hot.
__Stuart Yeah, he kind of is.
__Sheldon I know Mr. Data isn't supposed to smile, but here it comes.
__Howard Come on, guys. Let's do this.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm sweating my bald cap off.
__Howard So what's our first pose going to be?
__Raj I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
__Leonard I'll set the timer.
__Howard Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?
__Sheldon Mr. Data's weapon is his mind. I'm wielding it.
__Raj Phasers on the Borg! Charlie's Angels.
__Howard Okay, what's next?
__Raj Now let's do some sexy glamour shots. I'll set the mood.  Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That's right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…
__Leonard What? Hey, hey! Come back here!
__Raj Stop!
__Sheldon Stealing is against the law!
__Leonard I don't believe this.
__Howard Son of a bitch.
__Raj I'll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.
__Howard Oh, so is mine.
__Leonard Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?
__Sheldon Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame.  Nice going.
__Sheldon What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
__Leonard I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.
__Sheldon You're right. Nice going.
__Howard Car.
__Raj What is wrong with people? Why don't they stop?
__Sheldon Maybe we're better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
__Leonard Look at us, Sheldon. We're the crazy people.
__Sheldon Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.
__Howard Good idea. Why don't you get started on that?
__Leonard Come on, let's just start walking. There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.
__Sheldon What, you think just because you're wearing a captain's uniform, you're in charge?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon All right.
__Bernadette I don't know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!
__Penny Yeah, well, I have street smarts.
__Bernadette So, what'd you guys think?
__Amy Well, there was a lot of action.
__Penny Mmm.
__Amy And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what's the word I'm looking for?
__Penny Stupid?
__Amy So stupid.
__Penny I don't know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.
__Bernadette It's crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don't even exist.
__Amy What a waste of time.
__Penny I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
__Bernadette I don't think it's heavy. It's some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.
__Penny That makes even less sense, I mean…
__Amy No, no, no, it doesn't. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.
__Penny Okay, hang on, what if Thor's hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he's touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?
__Bernadette No.
__Amy Yes.
__Penny Well, which is it?
__Amy Maybe we missed something.
__Bernadette Let's read it again.
__Amy Yeah.
__Bernadette You want some tea?
__Amy Good idea. I'll help you.
__Penny Wait, I thought we were reading.
__Amy We are. We're just, uh, giving you a head start.
__Raj Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I've got poached testicles.
__Leonard Oh, you poor thing, you're sweating. That's so much worse than having your car stolen.
__Raj Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It's not gonna de-funk my junk.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We're Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.
__Leonard Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.
__Sheldon Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop…
__Guys in Passing Car Nerds!
__Sheldon I hate this planet.
__Bernadette Hold on, who decides who's worthy? Does the hammer decide?
__Penny Yes!
__Amy No! It can't decide. It's a hammer.
__Penny You said it's a magic hammer.
__Amy Yeah, but, it can't make decisions.
__Penny If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions, why can't Thor's hammer?
__Amy Okay, if you're going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.
__Leonard Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.
__Sheldon Scotty was on the original series, and we're Next Generation. So, joke's on you.
__Howard We're not with him.
__Penny Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?
__Amy Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
__Bernadette Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don't we go look at those?
__Penny Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that's right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.
__Leonard Our clothes, our wallets, phones.
__Raj And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.
__Policeman Makeup? Sure.
__Leonard Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It's cooler than it sounds.
__Policeman I don't know, sounds pretty cool.
__Raj It, it is. It's not just comic books. They've got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.
__Leonard Okay, he gets how cool it is.
__Policeman I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I'm guessing your moms?
__Leonard Thanks, but we've got it covered.
__Raj Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.
__Leonard Are you kidding me? After all we've been through, I just want to go home.
__Raj Don't be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.
__Howard I'm with Leonard. I'm done.
__Raj Fine, then I guess it's two against two. How do we decide?
__Sheldon Actually, it's three against one.
__Raj What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, we're not. We're an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we're idiots. And to tell you the truth, I'm starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.
__Raj Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That's funny.
__Amy Yeah?
__Bernadette Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.
__Amy No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.
__Penny Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?
__Amy Did that ever happen?
__Penny Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?
__Amy Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer 'cause Thor's touching it.
__Penny No, it's because they're in space. He's really just touching the strap.
__Amy The strap is part of the hammer.
__Bernadette No, it's not!
__Raj Are they actually arguing about comic books?
__Leonard No, that can't be right.
__Howard Maybe Thor's Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.
__Bernadette Then Red Hulk must be worthy.
__Penny How could Red Hulk be worthy?
__Sheldon There's only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
__Raj If it's an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.
__Sheldon Captain, what are your orders?
__Leonard I say we investigate.
__Sheldon Wait. They might be hostile.
__Leonard Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.
__First Car Thief Wow, that is interesting.
__Second Car Thief You learn something new every day.
__GPS Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?
__First Car Thief Ooh, another quiz.
__Second Car Thief Yes!
__Sheldon I'll eat later. Right now, I'm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.
__Penny It's hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
__Raj So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?
__Howard Let me see.
__Raj Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.
__Howard Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.
__Leonard Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we've bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don't you think?
__Penny Yeah, if that's your idea of what's cool, you should get one.
__Leonard Yeah, so, I'm out.
__Raj What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?
__Sheldon Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Don't waste my time.
__Penny Honey, if you want one, just get one.
__Howard You're still out, right?
__ Credits sequence.
__Kripke Cooper?
__Sheldon Nobel. Kripke. Don't look at my board.
__Kripke What's that?
__Sheldon That's a drawing of a really cool train. Don't look at that, either. What do you want?
__Kripke I have some bad news. You're working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I'm working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.
__Sheldon So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That's hard cheese, Barry. You're one of the good ones.
__Kripke No, they're making us work together.
__Sheldon That's ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn't even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!
__Howard Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.
__Raj They're here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I've ever spent.
__Leonard A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?
__Howard Easy. His family's loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.
__Raj Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I'm not dark chocolate. I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.
__Howard Oh, man. Look at my nose.
__Leonard Maybe it's a shipping problem.
__Howard What?
__Leonard Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
__Raj This sucks.
__Howard I can't believe I wasted all that money.
__Leonard Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn't let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.
__Leonard Well, sometimes there's a secret ending, like in The Avengers.
__Penny Yeah, but I don't think that's going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.
__Leonard They could show bloopers. Oh, no.
__Penny What is that?
__Leonard That is Sheldon's “I'm unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on, let's just go to your place.
__Penny Well, wait, if he's unhappy,shouldn't we talk to him?
__Leonard Shouldn't we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?
__Penny You doing okay, sweetie?
__Sheldon There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don't know where you're from, but where I'm from, that means I'm not doing okay.
__Leonard Want me to make you some tea?
__Sheldon Tea is for when I'm upset. I'm not upset. The university's forcing me to work with Kripke. I'm outraged.
__Leonard So, cocoa?
__Sheldon Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it's like to be paired with someone who's so incredibly annoying?
__Leonard Oh, teacher! Me! Me!
__Sheldon See, I did all this great work, and now he's just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.
__Penny What beverage do you make for that?
__Leonard Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
__Sheldon Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!
__Sheldon And yet, now you're in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.
__Kripke We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.
__Sheldon Why don't you show me yours first.
__Kripke You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.
__Sheldon How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
__Kripke Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other's work, meet again tomowow?
__Sheldon Fine.
__Kripke Nice twy. This is bwank paper.
__Sheldon And I am sure it's still more valuable than whatever's in here.
__Kripke Cough it up, Cooper.
__Sheldon Very well.
__Kripke If this one's bwank, too, I'm going to be fuwious.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Howard Get that waste of money out of my face.
__Raj It's only a waste of money if we don't play with them.  He's right, dawg.
__Howard Please, I'm working.
__Raj You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.
__Howard Oh, yeah? How's that?
__Raj Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it's three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.
__Raj Of course you have. They're an engineer's dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.
__Howard Yeah, but they're so expensive.
__Raj Oh, come on. You deserve one. You've worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.
__Howard Well, the prices have been coming down.
__Raj Oh, true. They're practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.
__Howard And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…
__Raj Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin' dream house.
__Howard We don't need Malibu Koothrappali's dream house.
__Raj Really, smart guy? Where's he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?
__Amy All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Amy Sheldon, what's going on?
__Sheldon I read his research, and, it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It's his mommy.
__Amy Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?
__Sheldon What do we have to lose?
__Amy How's that?
__Sheldon I feel like I'm being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why'd you stop?
__Sheldon I can't go in today. I'm sick.
__Leonard You're not sick. You just don't want to face Kripke.
__Sheldon No, look.
__Leonard 128.
__Sheldon See?
__Leonard What did you do, put this in your tea?
__Sheldon Oh, dear. Now I'm not even smarter than you.
__Leonard Sheldon, Kripke's not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.
__Sheldon Oh, don't play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.
__Leonard Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.
__Sheldon All right, geez. What a grouch.
__Leonard How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.
__Raj I think this thing was made in China.
__Howard Eh, what can you do?
__Raj Ooh, I, I think it's done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.
__Howard Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
__Raj And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.
__Howard Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.
__Raj Oh, I wish I was in better shape.
__Howard Stop holding your stomach in. I'll give you a six-pack with the computer.
__Raj Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.
__Howard All right, you can suck it in a little bit.
__Sheldon I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.
__Kripke Don't pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.
__Sheldon We do?
__Kripke You have a girlfwiend.
__Sheldon So?
__Kripke So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.
__Sheldon Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I'm getting.
__Kripke You wucky bastard.
__Sheldon What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.
__Kripke Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we're gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.
__Sheldon I'll do what I can. But it's not going to be easy, because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic
__Bernadette What?
__Howard Say hello to my little friend.
__Bernadette Oh, my God. That's so cute. I didn't think there could be a smaller version of you.
__Howard I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.
__Bernadette Oh, Howie, I love these.
__Howard I thought you might.
__Bernadette Were they expensive?
__Howard Didn't cost a thing. I made them myself.
__Bernadette How?
__Howard Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.
__Bernadette $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?
__Howard Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.
__Bernadette At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?
__Howard It's kind of dawning on me now.
__Bernadette I don't believe you. Howie, we can't afford to waste money on junk like this.
__Howard What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.
__Bernadette I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.
__Howard Yes, but we're married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don't like it, but that's how love works.
__Bernadette No, here's how love works. You're gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?
__Sheldon Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.
__Leonard Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
__Penny That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.
__Leonard I know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.
__Sheldon Of course.
__Penny You ever going to sleep with Amy?
__Sheldon That's awfully personal.
__Leonard We don't ask Sheldon things like that.
__Penny Maybe you don't, I do. What's the deal?
__Sheldon Well, word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.
__Penny All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?
__Leonard All right, we're down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?
__Penny Then what's the problem?
__Sheldon Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I'm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.
__Penny Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
__Sheldon It's a possibility.
__Penny Oh, my God!  Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Penny Oh, my God!
__Leonard Ow!
__Howard Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.
__Raj Wow, that's harsh.
__Howard Tell me about it.
__Raj Aren't you gonna eat lunch?
__Howard Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.
__Kripke Whatever. You get any wast night?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Kripke Gave it to her good, huh?
__Sheldon No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…
__Kripke Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?
__Sheldon I didn't notice.
__Kripke How could you not notice?
__Sheldon I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
__Kripke Ah, you're kiwing me, Cooper!
__Kripke Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?
__Sheldon Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
__Kripke A wocket? You'we a fweak! I wove it!
__Sheldon That's a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.
__Leonard Why would you say that?
__Sheldon You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It's called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.
__Leonard That was a huge spoiler.
__Sheldon Good.
__Leonard What is wrong with you? If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.
__Sheldon Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
__Leonard Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
__Sheldon Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.
__Leonard You are unbelievable. I don't know why I put up with you. You're controlling, you're irritating.
__Sheldon There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You're only proving my point, little lady.
__Leonard You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.
__Sheldon What? I'm annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don't yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts 'cause you think they're ugly. You're impossible.
__Leonard That's it. I don't, I don't have to put up with this.
__Sheldon Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.
__Leonard Aw. Here's what I think of your roommate agreement.
__Sheldon You pick that up right now.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.
__Leonard I don't care. I don't have to do anything you say because I don't think I want to live here anymore.
__Sheldon Where are you going?
__Leonard To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.
__Sheldon Crazy bastard?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Leonard, wait.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
__Howard Great. Come on in.
__Raj What, you don't say thank you?
__Howard It's my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.
__Raj Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette's company going to Vegas?
__Raj Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
__Howard Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
__Raj Is there a good anal leakage?
__Howard Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.
__Raj Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.
__Howard Hey, I got a favour to ask.
__Raj Sure.
__Howard My mom's been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
__Raj Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There's nothing funny about morbid obesity.
__Howard She's huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she's doing okay.
__Raj Dude, I'm a single man. Saturday night is my party night.
__Howard Really? What do you got going on?
__Raj I don't know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.
__Howard Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender's, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.
__Raj What time should I be at your mother's?
__Howard I told her around seven.
__Penny Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.
__Leonard Well, I've had it. I am done. I can't, I can't live with him for one more minute.
__Penny Wow. Where are you going to go?
__Leonard I was thinking here with you.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard That a problem?
__Penny No, not at all. No, it's, it's great. It's terrific. I, you know, I just can't help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how's he going to get by without you? Ernie.
__Leonard He's got Amy now.
__Penny Yeah, he does, but it's not the same.
__Leonard Why?
__Penny Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn't abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron's sister?
__Leonard Harry and Ginny get together?
__Penny Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can't do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.
__Leonard Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.
__Leonard Wow. It sounds to me like you don't want us to live together.
__Penny No. No, no, I do. I do. It's just, I mean, it's a really big step.
__Leonard Is it? We're together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn't do this?
__Penny Well, um, I'm just a little thirsty.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny I got nothing.
__Leonard Great. I'll go get my stuff.
__Penny Yeah. Okay, all right, don't freak out. You can make this work.
__Leonard Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.
__Penny Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.
__Raj No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I'm going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I'm a fireman rescuing an infant.
__Mrs Wolowitz Oh, please. You're a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.
__Mrs Wolowitz The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?
__Raj That would be lovely. Thank you.  Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?
__Mrs Wolowitz Don't mind me. I just cry when I'm lonely and have nothing to live for.
__Raj I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.
__Mrs Wolowitz Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?
__Raj Sure.
__Mrs Wolowitz I'll make one.
__Amy Children's toy.
__Sheldon The Next Generation phaser. That's Leonard's.
__Amy Children's toy.
__Sheldon One Game of Thrones collector's edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That's a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I'll keep it.
__Amy So, uh, what's your plan moving forward?
__Sheldon Uh, suppose I'll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.
__Amy Like a dog-boy.
__Sheldon Exactly.
__Amy What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
__Sheldon That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.
__Amy Great. Here I am!
__Sheldon Wait. Here who is where?
__Amy Me. Aren't I your perfect roommate?
__Sheldon Um…
__Sheldon Um…
__Amy Tell me one reason why this isn't a fantastic idea.
__Sheldon Um…
__Amy See? You can't. I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.
__Sheldon Um…
__Leonard What do you want?
__Sheldon Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.
__Sheldon Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I'll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I'll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.
__Leonard Cut to the chase, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Okay. Amy's decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That's a lot of product.
__Penny Hey. What's going on?
__Leonard Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.
__Penny Really? Interesting.
__Leonard Well, too late, pal. I'm not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn't that right?
__Penny It's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.
__Sheldon Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn't ready for.
__Penny Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn't mean you don't care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you're not comfortable with, and that's fine.
__Leonard Well, if he doesn't want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.
__Penny Well, maybe he doesn't know how to say it without hurting her feelings.
__Sheldon Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn't refute.
__Penny That is the worst, isn't it?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard I'm sorry, Sheldon. I can't help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door's about to slam in your face.
__Amy Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?
__Sheldon Um…
__Howard Hey. How'd it go last night with my mom?
__Raj Okay, I guess.
__Howard What time did you leave?
__Raj Actually, I'm still here.
__Howard What? You spent the night?
__Raj Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.
__Howard You wore my pyjamas?
__Raj Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.
__Mrs Wolowitz Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?
__Raj Oh, boy. Breakfast.
__Raj But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
__Howard If you don't leave now, she'll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.
__Raj Oh, Howard, stop.
__Howard Trust me, you're not Jewish. That's how they get you.
__Raj You're being silly. I can leave whenever I want.
__Howard Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?
__Raj They're on the chair, right over… Oy vey.
__Penny What did I do?
__Sheldon You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
__Penny Okay. Listen, the truth is I don't want him living with me.
__Sheldon Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
__Penny Yeah, and I've seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.
__Sheldon Hold on. If you don't want to live with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?
__Penny Well, you know how he is. He's sensitive and emotional.
__Sheldon That's because he drinks too much soy milk.
__Penny Well, I don't know what else we can do but tell them the truth.
__Sheldon I suppose there's no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.
__Penny Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.
__Bernadette Oh, thanks.
__Howard What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.
__Bernadette Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.
__Howard Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?
__Bernadette If you could bend that far, you'd be doing us both a favour.
__Howard Hey, Raj. What's up?
__Raj You were right. I can't get out of here.
__Raj I'm trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?
__Howard Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.
__Raj Come on, Howard, help me.
__Mrs Wolowitz Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.
__Raj Oh, my God. She's not gonna bathe me, is she?
__Howard Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.
__Raj But, Howard…
__Bernadette Should we go back and rescue him?
__Sheldon Is it kung pao chicken?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Brown rice, not white rice?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
__Amy Yes. I did good, right?
__Sheldon Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Yeah, why would you?
__Sheldon Hello. This is Sheldon.
__Amy And this is Amy.
__Sheldon We're not home right now.
__Amy ‘Cause we out dropping science, son.
__Together Leave a message.
__Amy Beep.
__Sheldon You can't live here.
__Amy What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn't break in.
__Sheldon No. It's not the message.
__Amy Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.
__Sheldon You did.
__Amy Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss 'cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you're ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can't live here.
__Sheldon It's Penny's fault.
__Amy What?
__Sheldon She doesn't want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She's the snake in our garden. She's the reason we can't be happy.
__Amy Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can't 'cause you don't want to live with Leonard.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Sheldon, what did you say?
__Sheldon I said the truth. You don't want to live with Leonard, and you know it.
__Leonard Since when don't you want to live with me?
__Sheldon Yeah, I think we should talk about that.
__Penny And since you love the truth so much, why don't you tell Amy you don't want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?
__Sheldon I thought we were talking about the other thing.
__Amy You're a coward.
__Sheldon Well, the evidence does support that.
__Penny Come on, Amy, let's go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.
__Amy You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.
__Penny Um…
__Sheldon Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
__Leonard ‘Kay.
__Sheldon Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Or maybe she doesn't. Let's find out.
__Raj No!
__Leonard Hmm?
__Penny This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.
__Leonard You're kidding. Did you Heimlich him?
__Penny No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy's choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich'ed him.
__Leonard You're a hero.
__Penny Yeah, that was the point of the story.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?
__Penny Um, I think so. Why?
__Leonard What do you mean, why? It's Valentine's Day.
__Penny Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.
__Penny No, I'm into it, I'm into it. Just, there's so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.
__Leonard Okay, well, this time it's going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don't see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!
__Penny You know, sometimes I think I've made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.
__Amy I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine's Day?
__Sheldon Oh, you caught that, did you?
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Everything okay?
__Howard Bernie's a little cranky since she's been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I've got a lot on my plate, too, because I've been busting my tail playing Assassin's Creed.
__Raj Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine's Day?
__Stuart Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?
__Raj Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.
__Stuart There must be something we can do.
__Raj Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don't have dates?
__ Stuart That actually sounds kind of nice.
__Stuart That's good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.
__Alex Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I've been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.
__Sheldon Oh, no, no. That's not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine's gift for my girlfriend.
__Alex You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.
__Sheldon Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let's see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.
__Howard Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.
__Leonard What you looking at?
__Howard Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine's Day since she's been such a pain in the ass.
__Howard Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.
__Leonard Oh, that's cool.
__Howard A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
__Leonard From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?
__Leonard Oh, wow.
__Leonard Oh, I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.
__Howard Oh, that's not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of…
__Leonard Want to come to dinner with us?
__Howard Yes, please.
__Alex Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy's Facebook page and read up on her interests.
__Sheldon Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let's knock them off.
__Alex Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.
__Sheldon Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?
__Alex No, I just thought it would be…
__Alex Okay. Um, I know she's a fan of The Canterbury Tales.
__Sheldon Mmm.
__Alex So I found this cool map that illustrates the character's journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.
__Sheldon But she's got Google Maps on her phone.
__Alex I don't know how to respond to that.
__Sheldon Well, I hope it's with a third good option, because these first two, buh.
__Alex Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy's a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.
__Sheldon Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.
__Alex Thank you.
__Sheldon I think I'll keep it for myself.
__Alex What about your girlfriend?
__Sheldon It's too late. I call dibs.
__Leonard Waugh, romance ninja.
__Penny Hey.
__Howard Sorry we're late.
__Penny No problem. We just sat down.
__Leonard Mmm, would you like some wine?
__Bernadette Yeah, fill her up. I'll tell you when to stop.
__Penny Is everything okay?
__Howard Terrific. Couldn't be better.
__Bernadette Oh, bite me.
__Howard Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.
__Bernadette Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I'd tell you.
__Leonard Uh, where what is?
__Howard She hid my Xbox like I'm a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.
__Bernadette I've been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.
__Howard I said I'm sorry.
__Bernadette Sorry doesn't clean my underpants, buddy.
__Howard I told you, turn them inside out.
__Bernadette And I told you to bite me.
__Leonard Trying to have a magical night here, guys.
__Penny Oh, son of a bitch.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Nothing. Nothing.
__Leonard No, tell me.
__Penny It's just this guy I used to date.
__Leonard Oh.
__Penny Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who's here with him now.
__Leonard You're kidding.
__Penny And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.
__Leonard I know it's not ideal, but don't let them ruin our night.
__Penny No, you're totally right. She could be skinny 'cause she's dying.
__Leonard That's the spirit.
__Penny You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Bernadette Uh-oh.
__Penny What? (Penny's ex is proposing to Gretchen) Oh, you got to be kidding me.
__Gretchen Oh, my God, yes. Of course I'll marry you.
__Leonard Two can play this game. Penny…
__Penny Get up.
__Leonard All right.
__Stuart Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.
__Raj Except on a date with anybody.
__Stuart Literally anybody.
__Stuart What?
__Raj Oh, yeah, think about it. We'd hang out, we'd read comic books, we'd see movies. It'd be like the best relationship ever.
__Stuart That does sound nice.
__Raj Then I'd take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.
__Stuart What?
__Leonard Isn't it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.
__Penny What, so I'm the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.
__Howard Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he'll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.
__Leonard You know what? Why don't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine's Day?
__Penny Yes, absolutely. Now they're doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.
__Leonard I thought we were letting it go.
__Penny We were; it's just, it's not fair, okay? They're bad people. It's not supposed to end happy for them, it's supposed to end happy for me.
__Leonard Um, it did end happy for you. You're here with me.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, I know.
__Leonard Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.
__Penny Oh, come on, don't make this about you.
__Leonard Oh, I'm not. It's about you.
__Penny Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine's Day sucks.
__Leonard This one does, and you're the reason why.
__Penny What?
__Bernadette You know, compared to them, I'm feeling pretty good about us.
__Howard Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I'll do that laundry.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__Howard I love you.
__Bernadette Love you, too.
__Bernadette Where you'd never look.
__Howard Damn it, it's in the washing machine.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Amy Happy Valentine's Day.
__Sheldon Okay. Shall we go to dinner?
__Amy Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.
__Sheldon Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I've been working on this facial expression all day.
__Amy And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine's Day.
__Sheldon What is that?
__Amy By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.
__Sheldon Really?
__Amy Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?
__Sheldon More than anything.
__Amy Well, then, that's what we're going to do.
__Sheldon Well, I don't know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone's ever given me. And that's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.
__Amy I'm your girlfriend. That's my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.
__Sheldon No. No, after everything you didn't do for me tonight, I want you to have it.
__Amy What's this?
__Sheldon Read it.
__Amy Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?
__Sheldon At the bottom.
__Amy In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler. And there's my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could've ever given me.
__Sheldon Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?
__Amy And you picked me.
__Sheldon It's like you said, you're my girlfriend.
__Amy Oh, Sheldon.
__Leonard Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it's like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.
__Penny Yeah, I know. I'm a total bitch.
__Leonard I'm not saying that.
__Leonard Fine, you win. You're a bitch. Why couldn't we just have a nice time?
__Penny I don't know. Maybe 'cause things are going so well between us lately and I've been really happy.
__Leonard Okay, you're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.
__Penny Obviously, I have some commitment issues.
__Leonard Glaringly obvious. Go on.
__Penny As long as things keep going great between us, you'll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I'm gonna end up saying yes, and then we're gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.
__Leonard Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.
__Penny What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?
__Leonard No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.
__Penny Really?
__Leonard Yes. It's all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.
__Penny Yeah, you got it.
__Leonard And I'm cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don't want to cry on a big screen like that.
__Penny Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.
__Leonard You do?
__Penny Leonard Hofstadter?
__Leonard Yes?
__Penny Will you be my valentine?
__Leonard Sorry. Maybe next year. I'm just kidding. Romance ninja. Let's have sex. Waugh!
__Raj We're glad you could make it.
__Nerdy guy Usually I spend Valentine's Day sad and alone. This year, I'm just sad.
__Stuart I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight's the night I know everyone else does, too.
__Nerdy guy I think you're cool.
__Stuart Great.
__Raj I got to tell you, we've got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We're all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn't make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We've got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let's give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.
__Girl That was cool. What you said.
__Raj You really think so?
__Girl Yeah, I do.
__Raj Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or…?
__Girl Okay.
__Raj Later, losers!
__Girl I have to go to the bathroom.
__Raj I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I've had it checked out, it's nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this.  I should have bought condoms.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Hello.
__Sheldon So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.
__Penny Yeah, I can't tell you how many times I've been at a party where everyone's talking about flags and I just couldn't join in.
__Sheldon Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.
__Penny Uh, I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?
__Sheldon What's wrong?
__Penny I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It's something we work on in my acting class.
__Sheldon Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn't the compliment it sounds like.
__Penny Yeah, let's try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you're all hunched like that, you're shutting the audience out, but when you're relaxed and open, you're inviting them in.
__Sheldon Right. And which one do I want?
__Penny Let's try open.
__Sheldon If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it's to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?
__Penny Um, well, I'm from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?
__Sheldon Gosh, Penny, what'd you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.
__Bernadette Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?
__Leonard Don't look under that rock.  Raj, you okay?
__Howard You in there?
__Raj Go away!
__Leonard Come on, buddy, open up.
__Howard We're worried about you.
__Raj Oh, just because I've stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.
__Bernadette Did something good happen?
__Raj Of course not. Nothing good ever happens.
__Leonard Whoa.
__Raj What?
__Leonard Nope, just, just, whoa.
__Bernadette It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.
__Leonard Raj, what's going on?
__Raj I was humiliated by yet another woman.
__Howard You didn't kill her and chop her up, that's not what we're smelling, right?
__Raj No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.
__Bernadette Oh, you poor baby.
__Howard I'm sorry. That's awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.
__Leonard Yeah, you can't stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.
__Raj Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.
__Leonard Lobsters overnight?
__Howard Oh, you're kidding. Let me see. Well, I'll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.
__Leonard The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.
__Bernadette Guys, we're trying to get him out of here, not you in.
__Raj You're wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.
__Howard Now what?
__Leonard I don't know.
__Sheldon Hello. How's the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
__Amy Fine. Just hold on. Mommy's on the phone! Sorry. We've cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.
__Sheldon Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.
__Amy Oh, that's right. How'd it go with Penny?
__Sheldon Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.
__Amy Subtle, but powerful.
__Sheldon I know. I'm still learning to control it.
__Amy Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?
__Sheldon Why would I do that?
__Amy Because she's your friend, and she did a nice job. I'm sure she'd like to hear it.
__Sheldon All right.
__Amy I didn't mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I'd like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.
__Sheldon Um…
__Penny You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
__Sheldon No. I didn't start yet, it's fine.
__Penny Okay. So, what do you need?
__Penny Really?
__Sheldon Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.
__Penny Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Penny Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.
__Sheldon Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?
__Sheldon Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.
__Amy Why? What happened?
__Sheldon She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don't worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.
__Amy Sheldon, that's very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.
__Sheldon Oh, so many crazy rules.
__Amy That better be Tootsie Rolls you're throwing at me!
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I'm obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I'll go to your dopey play.
__Penny Hey, I don't want you to go any more.
__Sheldon Why not?
__Penny You should go 'cause you want to go, not because you have to.
__Sheldon Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?
__Penny Okay. Do whatever you want.
__Penny Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.
__Sheldon All right. I don't want to, but at least that makes sense.
__Howard He's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.
__Sheldon Oh, brilliant. I've been itching to pull that trigger.
__Howard He's upset because he can't get anywhere with women.
__Sheldon Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I'm just funnin' ya.
__Girl Hi. I don't know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.
__Stuart Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.
__Girl Uh, yeah.
__Howard You're the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.
__Girl Sorry. Can you just give him this?
__Howard Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you're only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.
__Raj I don't want to celebrate.
__Howard Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.
__Raj Why would I want her number? I don't want anything to do with this woman.
__Howard Oh, come on, Raj.
__Raj No, you don't get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I'm a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.
__Howard Boy, I want to tell you it's her loss, but you are not making it easy.
__Raj You're, you're a good friend for trying to help, but, I've made my choice.
__Howard All right. Well, I'll see you around.
__Raj See you. No, wait, take her number. I don't want the temptation.
__Howard Okay.
__Raj I must be strong so I don't stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.
__Howard All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.
__Amy Sadly, I'm no longer associated with that project.
__Leonard Why? What happened?
__Amy Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you're unprofessional.
__Leonard I'm sorry. That I asked.
__Sheldon All right, let's get this stupid play over with.
__Leonard Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.
__Sheldon Why?
__Leonard You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.
__Sheldon Aw, for Pete's sake. Can we go now?
__Leonard Well, is that all of it? (Pulls a Rubik's cube from his pants.) Just set it down.
__Amy Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.
__Sheldon It's about streetcars? Oh, great. I won't need this. (Pulls out an etch-a-sketch.)
__Girl Hi.
__Raj Uh, would you like to come in?
__Girl Oh, no, I can't stay.
__Raj Oh.
__Girl I just wanted to say, I'm sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn't cool. So, uh, yeah. I'm sorry.
__Girl No, it's not any of that. It's just, I kind of have a hard time around people I don't know.
__Raj Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
__Girl I've been trying to force myself into situations that I'm not comfortable with. I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in. I don't even like comic books.
__Raj Yeah, me neither.
__Girl Then what were you doing there?
__Raj I lied. I love them. I only said that so you'd go out with me.
__Raj That's great. I'm broken, too.
__Girl Oh, no, you're not.
__Raj Oh, I totally am. If it wasn't for this beer, I couldn't even talk to you right now. I'm a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.
__Girl Well, how do I know you're not just saying that?
__Raj Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you'll see.
__Girl Okay. Text me. Bye.
__Raj You won't regret it. I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it's done.
__Actor Yes.
__Penny I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You'll be lonely when she passes on, won't you? I understand what that is.
__Actor To be lonely?
__Leonard She's pretty good, huh?
__Sheldon She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?
__Penny …when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That's how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.
__Sheldon She's remarkable.
__Leonard She really is.
__Amy Our Penny's a star.
__Sheldon How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can't remember no tomato on my hamburger?
__Howard I got whine.
__Sheldon I got the B word.
__Leonard Yeah, well, it's in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.
__Howard Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn't have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.
__Sheldon If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.
__Leonard Helping women? Y
__Sheldon Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.
__Leonard Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?
__Leonard You don't think it's worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
__Sheldon I think that's incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.
__Leonard You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?
__Howard Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.
__Sheldon Howard's disturbing recollections aside, I don't appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.
__Leonard Yes, I know, you're too smart for this.
__Sheldon Exactly. It's like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
__Leonard Got it. All right, I'm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.
__Sheldon I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.
__Howard Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we've really helped women today. Let's fire up the old Xbox.
__Leonard Guys, please don't make this a school project where I'm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.
__Sheldon We're not. This time you're the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
__Howard So, you think I'm one of the smarter kids?
__Sheldon No, you're a tool I was using to make my point.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
__Howard Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.
__Sheldon Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.
__Leonard Sheldon, you're always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
__Sheldon All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it's too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
__Leonard That's actually good. Why didn't I think of that?
__Sheldon Some people are otters, some people are rocks.
__Leonard I wonder if there's a way we could give the idea a trial run.
__Howard Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.
__Leonard That's great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.
__Sheldon Oh, hold on. While I'm comfortable speaking about science, I'm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.
__Howard What exactly are you looking up?
__Sheldon How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
__Leonard and Howard No!
__Penny Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I've slept with guys for less. It's a joke. Based on real events.
__Raj Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.
__Amy Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.
__Raj Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.
__Bernadette Why don't you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you're in the dark, she's holding onto you.
__Penny Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It's a joke. Based on real events.
__Amy I haven't been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.
__Bernadette Weekends are too crowded.
__Penny So, blow off work, go on a weekday.
__Amy Hooky? I've never played hooky in my life. My mom said that's how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
__Penny It's more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
__Bernadette Joke?
__Penny I can laugh about it now.
__Bernadette So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?
__Penny I'm in.
__Amy Me, too.
__Raj Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?
__Penny Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?
__Raj I am a man who can't talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can't be around other people.
__Penny Yeah, that's a toughie.
__Bernadette Let's think.
__Amy Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?
__Howard Well, they're actually pretty excited. I'm their most famous alum. If you don't count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.
__Sheldon This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.
__Howard Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.
__Leonard And now you're also an astronaut.
__Howard So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here's my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can't figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there.  Hey.
__Kid What?
__Howard Nothing.
__Sheldon Smart. We don't want any problems.
__Bernadette What did you tell your boss?
__Amy Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o'clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I'm going to Disneyland.
__Bernadette Penny, what did you say?
__Penny I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.
__Amy So, what are we gonna do first?
__Bernadette I don't know about you guys, but I'm gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.
__Amy Ooh, that sounds like fun.
__Penny You're kidding, right? We're not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?
__Amy Come on, do it with us.
__Penny All right, whatever. How does it work?
__Bernadette Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.
__Penny Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
__Amy Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.
__Penny Yeah.
__Bernadette We can't all be Cinderella.
__Amy Then how do we decide?
__Bernadette Well, it's simple. This was my idea. I'm driving. I'm Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.
__Raj She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.
__Man People say I'm a little awkward, too. May I join you?
__Raj No, you can't join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
__Man You can do better.
__Lucy Oh, we're eating here?  We're having a texting date?  I love that.
__Raj As you're reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.
__Sheldon Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can't happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?
__ Later.
__ The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you're sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.
__Girl Did you go to the moon?
__Girl Did you fly the rocket?
__Howard No, but I was in the rocket. I didn't actually…
__Girl So you just flew around? That's kind of like my uncle. He's a flight attendant.
__Howard No, I'm an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?
__Leonard Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what's called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?
__Girl 2 Girl 2: How did you decide to become a scientist?
__Leonard Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I've always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That's just a little freestyle.
__Lucy That's terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.
__Raj That's a fitting pun-ishment. I still don't know what you do for a living.
__Lucy Web design.
__Raj Anything I might have seen?
__Lucy I don't know. You ever look at porn Web sites?
__Raj No, never. What is porn?
__Lucy Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.
__Raj Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it's like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.
__Howard Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let's get out of here.
__Sheldon Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don't know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it's clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?
__Amy We're here.
__Sheldon Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
__Amy It's our pleasure. I'm Dr. Fowler, and I'm a neuroscientist.
__Bernadette And I'm Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I'm a microbiologist.
__Amy The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.
__Bernadette That's true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
__Penny Unless you want to be Cinderella.
__Bernadette Come at me. See what happens.
__Lucy  My battery's dying, so I'm just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I've been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I'm gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that's okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.
__Raj I'm counting that as foreplay.
__Bernadette Yes, and I have a surprise for you.
__Howard Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.
__Bernadette Well, hello, Prince Charming.
__Howard Milady.
__Penny I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?
__Leonard Disneyland. Go on, I'm listening.
__Sheldon Heard you the first time.
__Howard You said clean up. I'm cleaning up.
__Bernadette You can't just throw everything in the closet.
__Howard Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can't do both. This isn't sex.
__Bernadette What if someone looks in there?
__Howard They're just coming over for dinner. No one's gonna look in the closet.
__Bernadette Well, you don't know that. What if someone's looking for the bathroom and they open that door?
__Howard Could work out. For all we know there's a toilet in there somewhere.
__Bernadette Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
__Howard You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
__Bernadette Why?
__Howard Are you kidding? He's like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you'll see a label that says label.
__Bernadette He's our guest, we can't just ask him to straighten our closet.
__Howard No, we wouldn't ask him. We'd just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.
__All Hi.
__Penny Ooh, it smells good.
__Bernadette Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight's the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.
__Sheldon Oh, you shouldn't have.
__Bernadette Oh, it's my pleasure.
__Sheldon No, you really shouldn't have. I brought my own.
__Bernadette You stopped and got him takeout?
__Leonard I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
__Bernadette Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.
__Sheldon Well, now don't you feel silly.
__Bernadette Show him the closet.
__ Credits sequence.
__Bernadette That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.
__Raj Oh, well, I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as good if I hadn't tried your food first.
__Sheldon Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?
__Howard Colour's fine.
__Sheldon Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.
__Penny Sheldon, aren't you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
__Amy Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.
__Sheldon Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.
__Amy His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
__Sheldon Oh, five more minutes.
__Leonard That's what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let's move it.
__Sheldon How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
__Howard You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.
__Sheldon Please, Leonard, he said it's okay.
__Sheldon Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?
__Howard Juggle.
__Sheldon You health nuts kill me.
__Bernadette Oh, my God, it's beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
__Sheldon Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…
__Howard Whoa, you opened this?
__Sheldon Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…
__Bernadette Howard, don't you want to know what's in the letter?
__Howard If I wanted to know, I would've opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let's get out of here.
__Sheldon Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?
__Howard Do whatever you want.
__Sheldon Thanks. Oh. Great party.
__Penny What is your point?
__Leonard Well, it's just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
__Penny Really? You couldn't just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
__Leonard Trying to paint a picture.
__Penny It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
__Leonard Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.
__Penny Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?
__Leonard Yeah. Although…
__Penny No.
__Howard Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.
__Bernadette Told you you shouldn't have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it's not worth it.
__Howard It's this stupid letter.
__Bernadette Did you read it?
__Howard No.
__Bernadette You must be curious.
__Howard Of course I'm curious. I haven't seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What's that about?
__Bernadette Why don't you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
__Howard He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
__Bernadette I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?
__Howard Something I should have done a long time ago.
__Bernadette Really? Are you sure?
__Howard Yep.
__Howard I do.  Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
__Bernadette Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day 'cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don't know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.
__Amy Boy, I'm really curious what was in that letter.
__Bernadette Me, too, but I guess now we'll never know.
__Amy Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?
__Bernadette I can't do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn't respect my husband's privacy?
__Penny What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
__Bermadette That works.
__Penny Okay.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?
__Amy You have something we want.
__Sheldon Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.
__Penny No, we just want information.
__Sheldon Oh. Oh, I've got that in spades. Ravage me.
__Penny We heard you read the letter from Howard's father.
__Sheldon I did.
__Penny What did it say?
__Sheldon I can't tell you that. I'm bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
__Amy Sheldon, that's not a real thing.
__Sheldon Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend's hand at the movies. You know. That doesn't stop you from pawing at me like you're a bear and I'm a trash can full of sweets.
__Penny Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
__Sheldon Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn't give me the right to disseminate it freely.
__Penny Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet. Doesn't that count for something?
__Penny Yeah, obviously.
__Sheldon Well played. Sometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny.
__Leonard Actually, all I did was invite you.
__Leonard I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d'oeuvres.
__Raj So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe's? Hate to miss that.
__Leonard Hey, where have you been?
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I'd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.
__Leonard One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you've been gone a long time.
__Leonard What information?
__Sheldon I can't tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
__Raj Well, come on, we won't tell anyone.
__Sheldon Sorry, badgering me won't work. What you should have said is, It's pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.
__Leonard Fine, then that.
__Sheldon All right, I'll tell you. My goodness, everyone's on their game today.
__Raj Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up once in a while.
__Leonard As is the company.
__Penny Aw.
__Sheldon My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
__Leonard Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.
__Raj Of course.
__Penny Sure.
__Amy Absolutely.
__Sheldon If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?
__Bernadette Yeah, try doing it in heels.
__Howard I am.
__Bernadette Wait. There's something I have to tell you.
__Howard What?
__Bernadette I know what was in your dad's letter.
__Howard Sheldon, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you.
__Amy Hey.
__Bernadette I made him tell us.
__Howard What? Us? Who else knows?
__Penny I know.
__Amy Me, too.
__Leonard Same here.
__Raj Shame on all of you.
__Leonard You know, too.
__Raj Couldn't leave him one friend, could you?
__Howard So everybody knows what's in that letter except for me?
__Sheldon Yes, it's six against one. Stand down, sir.
__Howard How could you do this?
__Bernadette I'm sorry.
__Raj If you want, we could tell you.
__Howard No, I don't want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to go.
__Amy Use me as a human shield!
__Sheldon I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
__Howard In here.
__Bernadette I'm sorry. I should have left it alone.
__Howard It's okay. Sorry I ran off like that.
__Bernadette What are you looking at?
__Howard Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.
__Bernadette That's nice.
__Howard I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.
__Bernadette Think you could take a break?
__Howard Why?
__Bernadette Got a little surprise for you. Come on.
__Howard Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I'll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?
__Leonard When you left, you weren't sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.
__Howard Oh, yeah, what's that?
__Sheldon It's simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.
__Penny We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…
__Sheldon Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don't tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
__Penny Yeah. And I said if it wasn't epistemic, we might as well not do it.
__Bernadette Sit down, honey.
__Leonard Raj, you're up.
__Raj Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it's a fly. Silly frog. So funny.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
__Howard Nice try. That's the plot for Goonies.
__Amy Told you.
__Sheldon Don't.
__Leonard Amy.
__Howard Really?
__Sheldon Or that's complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
__Leonard Penny.
__Penny It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn't who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
__Sheldon I would like to change mine. The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it's completely different from Goonies.
__Amy No, it's not.
__Sheldon Don't.
__Leonard Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.
__Howard Hmm.
__Leonard Bernadette.
__Bernadette Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?
__Howard Yeah. I'm terrific.
__Leonard So, which one do you think it is, matey?
__Howard Actually, I don't want to know. I want all of them to be true.
__Leonard Well, one of them is.
__Howard That's pretty cool. Thank you, guys.
__Penny Hey, it's still early. Why don't we go back and have that party?
__Leonard Yeah, cool.
__Amy Okay.
__Sheldon You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn't the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette's diary has some saucy passages.
__Bernadette Sheldon, don't you dare.
__Sheldon There's nothing to worry about. Your secret's safe with me.
__Bernadette That's more like it.
__Sheldon Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
__Howard Me, too. If I'd known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.
__Penny This turned out pretty well, huh?
__Leonard Yeah, I think so.
__Raj I agree. That is, if you've never been to or heard of a party before.
__Amy If you'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you'd be happy all the time.
__Sheldon Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you're keeping this dead goldfish?
__Penny Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.
__Sheldon Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
__Penny Party's over! Party's over!
__Howard We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.
__Leonard My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.
__Raj Only if you're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
__Sheldon If I could keep my Gmail account, I'd be okay with that.
__Barry – Hewwo, fewwas.
__All Hey.
__Barry Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman's office was?
__Howard Yeah?
__Barry Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two weeks.
__Howard That's terrible.
__Leonard Oh, my God.
__Barry In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.
__Sheldon If we're going to change the topic from jellyfish, I'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.
__Howard Show a little compassion, a man died.
__Barry And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.
__Sheldon Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.
__Raj Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.
__Sheldon Pchew!
__Barry If you need my nose, you'll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee.
__Howard You Ph.D's gonna go suck up like Kripke?
__Leonard No. I mean, I'll apply, but I'm not gonna stoop to playing politics.
__Raj Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can't get tenure, I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.
__Sheldon Raj, don't dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.
__Sheldon Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Yup.
__Penny You can't get fired even if you're bad at it?
__Leonard Mm, not really.
__Penny Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
__Amy Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?
__Sheldon Mm-hmm.
__Amy Do they know they don't stand a chance 'cause you're so great?
__Sheldon Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.
__Howard Money from family does come with strings attached.
__Bernadette I think that's enough wine for now.
__Penny She'd be proud, huh?
__Leonard Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.
__Amy Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.
__Sheldon Or, the chainsaw.
__Bernadette I'm gonna make some coffee.
__Leonard I'm not gonna schmooze anybody. I'm gonna let my work speak for itself.
__Penny That's great. That shows a lot of integrity.
__Leonard Thank you. I'm a naive idiot, right?
__Penny Oh, good, you heard me.
__Sheldon Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
__Amy You don't say.
__Sheldon But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to know who's on the committee. Let's see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.
__Amy Is that a problem?
__Sheldon Well…
__ Even you. You're a slave.
__Janine I'm a what?
__ I'm not sure, it could go either way.
__Leonard Hey.
__Janine Dr. Hofstadter.
__Leonard Yeah. Just thought I'd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
__Janine Good for you.
__Leonard Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.
__Janine Thank you.
__Leonard I've got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I'm not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?
__Janine You push start.
__Leonard Right. This one might be broken.
__Janine You have to move.
__Janine Yep. I got to get a home gym.
__Leonard Well, I'm sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I'll be throwing my hat in the ring.
__Janine All right, I'll keep an eye out for that.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Barry Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in… ever.
__Leonard Go away.
__Barry Janine the Machine, wet's do this!
__Janine Hey, Barry.
__Leonard Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.
__Barry I guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead I baked you.
__Janine Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.
__Barry No, my pweasure.
__Leonard Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I've got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I'll e-mail it to you.
__Barry Aw wight, I'm warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?
__Janine Let's go.
__Leonard That's enough cardio for me. I'm just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.
__Janine You okay?
__Leonard Call someone.
__Janine Oh, come on.
__Raj Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.
__Shelldon Mrs Davis?  Mrs Davis?  Mrs Davis?
__Janine God, they're everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?
__Sheldon Yes, hello. I'm fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.
__Janine Uh, Dr. Cooper, that's not necessary.
__Sheldon It's too late. Get ready to like me.
__Sheldon The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.
__Sheldon Um… Well… You are black, right?
__Janine This meeting has come to an end.
__Sheldon Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let's see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.
__Raj Where have you been?
__Leonard Nurse's office.
__Howard Asthma attack?
__Howard You guys going to Professor Tupperman's memorial?
__Raj I don't know.
__Leonard Probably not.
__Sheldon Barely knew him.
__Howard Yeah, you wouldn't want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that's what I was hoping for, meerkats.
__Amy Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.
__Sheldon First of all, when you say things like that, people think you're crazy. Second, the reason I'm cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.
__Amy It sounds like a long and tedious evening.
__Sheldon Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I'd rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee's going to be there.
__Amy Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.
__Sheldon Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.
__Amy Of course it would. I'm well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.
__Sheldon Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.
__Penny Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.
__Leonard Wait, Sheldon's going to be there? We all promised we weren't going to go.
__Penny Oh, what a jerk.
__Leonard I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
__Penny Well, since Amy's going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?
__Leonard Oh, that's nice, but it-it's just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I'm not sure how much help you'd be.
__Penny Okay. I'm just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.
__Penny Oh, then you all can get tenure.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Amy Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?
__Sheldon Sad.
__Amy The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn't make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?
__Sheldon Glad.
__Amy Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?
__Sheldon Bad. However…
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Fine. Bad.
__Raj Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
__Sheldon You're here.
__Raj Excuse me. I'm here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.
__Sheldon So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.
__Leonard Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn't having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren't coming here, either.
__Raj I have a thick accent. You don't know what I said.
__Amy I'd like to know why Penny's here.
__Penny I'm here to support my man, just like you.
__Sheldon What are you going to do? Take people's drink orders and get them wrong?
__Leonard Do it.
__Sheldon What? Did she do it yet?
__Amy She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard's cause.
__Sheldon Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do. Don't just stand there. Take your breasts out.
__Howard Ooh, meerkat fight!
__Amy You're all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom's going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?
__Leonard Way to hit 'em with both barrels.
__Raj You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.
__Sheldon Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
__Raj Yes.
__Sheldon Okay, because that was not clear.
__Amy Sheldon!
__Sheldon What? That was ambiguous.
__Raj Well, now it's biguous. What are you gonna do about it?
__Sheldon Um…
__Howard You could talk some smack about his mother.
__Sheldon Well, yes, of course, he wouldn't like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.
__Leonard Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?
__Sheldon I don't know what you're doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.
__Leonard Oh, you do what you want, but I don't want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.
__Howard So is tenure.
__Bernadette Walk.
__Leonard I'm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
__Raj You're right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.
__Leonard How about it, Sheldon?
__Sheldon What do you think I should do?
__Amy Well, you'll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you'll make any more friends.
__Sheldon I don't want any more, but let's go.
__Barry Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.
__Janine I could not ask you to do that.
__Barry Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.
__Leonard No. We cannot lose to that jerk.
__Raj Yeah, screw it. I'm going in.
__Sheldon Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I'm going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don't worry, I didn't really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.
__Amy Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.
__Janine What?
__Sheldon I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.
__Janine Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.
__Sheldon I don't know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.
__Janine You didn't bring another gift, did you?
__Sheldon No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.
__Janine Good.
__Sheldon Anyway, thank you.
__Janine You're welcome.  I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.
__Sheldon Yeah, right on, sister.
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That'll come later.
__Penny Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can't afford another demerit.
__Leonard Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.
__Sheldon Mall Cop?
__Leonard I don't know. It's a fat guy on a Segway. That's funny everywhere.
__Sheldon I'm deleting it.
__Penny Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven't finished watching it yet.
__Leonard You know, if you're trying to make space on the DVR, why don't you just get rid of some of the stuff you've already watched? Like, um, Alphas.
__Sheldon No, that's the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts.
__Leonard There is no season three. They cancelled that show.
__Sheldon Well, they can't cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.
__Leonard They did.
__Penny Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?
__Sheldon Dumplings? Don't you understand what's going on here?
__Penny As a rule, no.
__Sheldon That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I'll never know what happened.
__Penny Well, why don't you make up your own ending?
__Sheldon Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums. I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.
__Leonard Oh, please, don't do that.
__Sheldon No. They can't just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
__Penny I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.
__Leonard Ah, don't. If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn't have started a sci-fi channel.
__ Credits sequence
__Raj Whatever. I can see my little princess while I'm at work, right?
__Howard Why can't you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.
__Raj Wait, hold on. This is weird.
__Howard What?
__Raj I was Googling that girl I've been dating, and I found her blog.
__Howard Cool. Anything juicy?
__Raj She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he's Indian? And he's an astrophysicist, too?
__Howard You know what's going on, don't you?
__Raj Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.
__Howard I can't believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.
__Raj Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.
__Howard Keep reading. What does it say?
__Raj No, no, I don't know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me. It's almost like I'm reading her diary.
__Howard It's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.
__Raj No, this is creepy.
__Howard Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.
__Raj It's not creepy. Don't listen to him. Oh, look who's got the sweetest kisses.
__Howard Should I go?
__Penny It's six thirty in the morning.
__Leonard I thought you grew up on a farm.
__Amy I'm sorry you're upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.
__Sheldon I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
__Amy Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.
__Sheldon Oh, that's nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don't care how they end.
__Amy You know, I might be able to help you with this. There's a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.
__Sheldon Yeah, but I just told you, I don't have a problem with closure.
__Amy You sure about that?
__Sheldon Oh, quite sure.  That proves nothing.
__Howard Yeah. Let's go.
__Raj Thanks a lot.
__Howard What's going on?
__Raj I broke down, and I read Lucy's blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.
__Howard Just a little? That's great.
__Raj I have to talk to her about this.
__Raj Well, that doesn't seem fair.
__Howard Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?
__Raj No, it's not. I've always thought that was unfair.
__Raj Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn't you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
__Howard The key to her heart. That's nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
__Raj I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.
__Penny It was cute.
__Leonard Oh, don't say cute. That's the worst.
__Penny What's wrong with cute?
__Leonard It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.
__Penny So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
__Leonard You can try, but nobody's gonna believe you. I just, I don't understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.
__Penny I liked it. I'm excited.
__Leonard Well, then, tell your face.
__Penny What do you want from me?
__Penny Oh, come on, don't be like that.
__Leonard Well…
__Penny I'm sorry I called it cute. Let's watch another one.
__Leonard Really?
__Penny Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.
__Leonard All right, cool. I think you'll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.
__Penny Oh. Well, that's like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.
__Sheldon I take issue with the word compulsive.
__Amy All I'm saying is, we live in a world where closure isn't always an op…
__Sheldon …tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let's say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?
__Sheldon By playing tic-tac-toe?
__Amy Yep. Your turn.
__Sheldon Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I'm about to win.  B-But we didn't finish.
__Amy Exactly. How does that make you feel?
__Sheldon The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.
__Amy And that's exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
__Sheldon Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.
__Amy Come on, you can do this.
__Sheldon You don't know what it's like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
__Amy Yeah, sounds like a drag.
__Bernadette Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?
__Penny Yippee, it's backwards. I get it.
__Bernadette Why does this bother you so much?
__Penny I don't know. It's just, he's so passionate about so many different things. I just don't get that way. Do you?
__Bernadette Well, sure. I'm pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.
__Penny See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.
__Bernadette Well, there's no reason you can't.
__Penny You think?
__Bernadette Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you're passionate about.
__Penny Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.
__Raj Uh, Lucy's coming over. I need some advice.
__Howard However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.
__Raj Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.
__Howard I don't know. Go with hockey.
__Raj Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that's her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.
__Lucy Hi.
__Raj Come in.
__Lucy Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.
__Raj Yeah, well, I wouldn't get too close. If I give the right command in German, she'll rip your face off.
__2.Amy 2 That's quite an impressive layout, isn't it?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Amy Let's box it up.
__Sheldon Let's box it up.
__3.Amy 3. (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just before the end of the tune) That's enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!
__4. Amy 4 Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can't come true.
__Sheldon Lucky for you, 'cause I wished you were dead.
__Raj Thanks. I love hockey.
__Lucy Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who's your favourite player?
__Raj Not Brian Boitano, that's for sure. How's your burrito?
__Lucy It's still a little frozen in the middle.
__Raj Probably because I didn't read the instructions. No wrapper's going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.
__Lucy Is something going on?
__Raj What do you mean?
__Raj I don't know. Maybe it's all those steroids I've been taking.
__Lucy I think I'm gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.
__Raj Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.
__Lucy Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn't think anybody actually read it.
__Raj No kidding. You didn't make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.
__Raj You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.
__Lucy Raj, I didn't say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you're sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.
__Raj I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.
__Lucy So, are you okay?
__Lucy Good. Do you even like hockey?
__Raj No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.
__Leonard The Harmony One was fine. We didn't need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.
__Penny See, that's the kind of passion I didn't think I had. But then I realized I'm passionate about you.
__Leonard Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.
__Penny No, I'm serious. Look, I've always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn't worth getting excited about.
__Leonard Those things can still happen.
__Penny Oh, obviously it's gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn't wait, you know? I've got you, I've got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.
__Leonard That's a big deal.
__Penny It is, isn't it?
__Leonard So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?
__Penny Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.
__Amy I'm a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.
__Sheldon Well, you're an excellent neuroscientist, you're a wonderful girlfriend, and…
__Amy And?
__Sheldon Doesn't matter, does it?
__Amy I'm proud of you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon And a complete sucker.
__ 1. (Redraws tic-tac-toe board) Oh, yeah.
__ 2.
__ 3. (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.) There he is.
__4. Sheldon 4 And the home of the brave.
__5.Sheldon 5 Don't stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.
__ Almost there, almost there. Uh-huh-huh!
__ Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you're in my life.
__Sheldon I love you, too.
__Penny Got it.
__Sheldon Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
__Leonard Nice shot.
__Penny Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
__Leonard You're kidding. He's still alive?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard He was the host of this great… Hey!
__Sheldon Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
__Leonard It was pretty cool.
__Penny Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.
__Sheldon Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He's still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
__Leonard Hire him to do what?
__Sheldon Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
__Leonard It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn't I?
__Sheldon Well, I'm e-mailing him right now.
__Leonard Do you remember his old theme song?
__Sheldon Of course I do.
__Together Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Why don't you put her in a kennel?
__Raj Why don't you put your mother in a home?
__Howard To be honest, she'd do better in the kennel. I'll talk to Bernie. I'm sure it's fine.
__Raj Thank you.
__Sheldon It's happening. Leonard, it's happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
__Leonard You're kidding.
__Howard You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
__Sheldon And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I'd find a tactful way to do that.
__Howard How'd you get him to come to your house?
__Sheldon As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can't solve if you use your noggin.
__Leonard And he wrote him a cheque.
__Sheldon Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.
__Howard You know if you had a stroke, she'd eat you, right?
__Raj And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
__Howard Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?
__Raj It's very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We're watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.
__Howard Classy dog.
__Raj Yes. Also, don't forget to close the toilet or she'll drink out of it.
__Howatd I feel for ya. I've got a psychotic mommy, too.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Me, too.
__Leonard Great.
__Sheldon I can't sleep.
__Leonard Well, I can, so shut up.
__Sheldon Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?
__Leonard Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
__Sheldon I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
__Leonard That's not ridiculous. Good night.
__Sheldon Do you have cufflinks?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o'clock in the morning?
__Leonard Okay, good night.
__Sheldon Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I still can't sleep.
__Bernadette Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.
__Howard It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
__Bernadette And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.
__Howard Yeah, that's what I was doing.
__Bernadette You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.
__Howard Really?
__Bernadette Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.
__Howard Of course we can. Especially if our baby's as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she's gone.
__Bernadette Where'd she go?
__Howard I don't know, she didn't leave a note.
__Bernadette Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.
__Howard No, I wasn't. You were.
__Bernadette No, I wasn't.
__Howard Yes, you were!.
__Bernadette Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.
__Sheldon Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o'clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we'd join him in progress.  It's him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
__Leonard Where is he?
__Sheldon The third floor landing. The poor old guy's been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It's really you.
__ Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should've told you about the broken elevator.
__Arthur I agree.
__Sheldon Professor Proton, it's an honour to meet you.
__Arthur Just, just call me Arthur.
__Sheldon Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we're friends.
__Sheldon Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes.
__Arthur Is, uh, is he dangerous?
__Leonard Actually, he's a genius.
__Sheldon I am.
__Arthur That doesn't answer my question.
__Leonard Mr. Jeffries, I'm, I'm Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.
__Arthur Hi.
__Penny Hello.
__Arthur Well, I hope I haven't, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.
__Sheldon Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show's for me. Come on. I'll race ya, Arthur.
__Arthur Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?
__Leonard Yes, sir.
__ So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?
__Arthur It, it's hard to say. I'm, I'm still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.
__Leonard We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
__Arthur Well, there, there really isn't too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children's parties to, to make a living.
__Leonard That's too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
__Sheldon Yes. And if there's time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
__Arthur You know, I'm a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.
__Sheldon Yeah, that's great. Did you bring your puppet?
__Arthur No, no. I, I hate that puppet.
__Sheldon Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It's nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
__Arthur I'm, I'm awake, right? Th, this is happening?
__Howard Cinnamon!
__Bernadette You know, maybe she doesn't recognize her name because of Raj's accent.
__Howard Good thinking.  Cinnamon, come to Daddy.
__Bernadette Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?
__Howard Nice.
__Bernadette Thanks.
__Howard When this all blows over, remember that voice. It's kind of a turn-on.
__Bernadette It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
__Howard Cinnamon!
__Penny I think I know.
__Sheldon It's gonna get sucked in. It's going to get sucked in.
__Penny Okay, I didn't know.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny See, I'm not a scientist like them.
__Arthur I, I figured that out.
__Sheldon Potato clock. Do potato clock.
__Penny What's that?
__Arthur I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.
__Penny Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn't that solve the world's energy crisis?
__Arthur No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I'm done.
__Sheldon What, well what's wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
__Leonard Then what is it?
__Arthur I don't know. I think I'm just, I, I just, I just don't want to be Professor Proton any more.
__Sheldon Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton's the best.
__Arthur What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I'm, I'm an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I'm a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.
__Sheldon 14:11,446
__Penny I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.
__Arthur Uh, thanks.
__Penny But if you don't mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?
__Arthur What do you two talk about?
__Sheldon I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
__Arthur I'll, I'll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.
__Sheldon Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn't have any friends growing up.
__Arthur No, I, I get that.
__Sheldon But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o'clock, you'd come to my house on Channel 68, and we'd do science together. If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows what would've become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could've wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
__Leonard I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
__Sheldon Yeah, it's true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
__Arthur Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.
__Leonard It's important you know how much you mean to us.
__Arthur Uh-oh.
__Arthur I'm having a problem with my pacemaker.
__Leonard I'll, I'll call for help.
__Penny Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
__Arthur No.
__Leonard You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
__Sheldon I'll do it.
__Arthur He's not a relative, he's not allowed, right?
__Paramedic No, that's not a rule. He can go.
__Sheldon Oh, yeah.
__Arthur I can't catch a break today.
__Penny We'll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
__Leonard I'm sorry things turned out this way.
__Sheldon Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this'll be the best day ever.
__Howard Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one's always a throwaway. How's this look?
__Bernadette It's fine. Where'd you get that picture of her?
__Howard It's not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs.  It's Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.
__Raj Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars' Lane?
__Howard What?
__Raj A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.
__Howard You have her?
__Bernadette Oh, thank God she's okay.
__Raj Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing's been shaking for hours.
__Howard I'm really sorry.
__Bernadette Hang on, you've had her for hours?
__Bernadette So you knew she was okay, and you couldn't pick up the phone to tell us?
__Raj Well, I, I thought about…
__Bernadette Don't well me, mister. We've been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.
__Raj Sorry. I, I just…
__Bernadette Sorry's not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you've done.
__Howard Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.
__Arthur Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.
__Sheldon Want me to sing it again?
__Arthur No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.
__Sheldon There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
__Arthur No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.
__Sheldon Name it.
__Arthur Well, I'm, I'm booked to do a children's party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don't feel up to it.
__Arthur Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you'd fill in for me.
__Sheldon Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
__Arthur Yeah.
__Sheldon Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
__Arthur Or a Korean family in Alhambra.
__Sheldon But they'll know I'm not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
__Arthur Sounds great.
__Sheldon So, in a way it's like I'm your son.
__Arthur What, Whatever.
__Sheldon Father.
__Arthur Sure, what the hell.
__Penny Vegas, here we come.
__Bernadette No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.
__Amy No rules? We're not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?
__Penny No.
__Amy So there are some rules.
__Bernadette Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.
__Amy Thank you. Vegas!
__Raj Anything can happen.
__Leonard It's gonna get crazy.
__Sheldon Dungeons & Dragons.
__Bernadette I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack.
__Amy I got some old underwear I'm gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.
__Penny I'm sorry, why old?
__Amy ‘Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.
__Leonard I've got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.
__Raj I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.
__Howard Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Isn't every conversation you two have awkward?
__Raj Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.
__Howard Ready whenever you guys are.
__Sheldon Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there. Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah?
__Sheldon I'm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
__Leonard Oh, that's nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.
__Sheldon Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I'm upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I'm upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I'm saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.
__Howard Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says,  Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.
__Leonard See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.
__Sheldon As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.
__Raj Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  Oh, Lucy's free after all. See ya.
__Leonard Hey, hey, hey, you can't leave. We just started.
__Raj You're right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I'm dead, I've got a date with a girl. Bye.
__Howard We'll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali's bloody corpse, and says,  don't worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest.  Well, I'm just a tree, but if I were you, I'd listen to your ghost friend.
__Sheldon Go on, give him your lunch money.
__Lucy Me, too.
__Raj Not that it's up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you're about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.
__Raj Really?
__Lucy Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you'll know why.
__Lucy Oh, it's okay. I've been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.
__Raj What else have you been thinking about doing?
__Lucy Well, let's see. I'd love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don't like bangs.
__Raj I like your bangs.
__Lucy Oh, thanks, I like 'em, too.
__Raj What else?
__Lucy Mmm, it's kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.
__Raj Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.
__Lucy I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53
__Howard Uh, it does.
__Sheldon He does sound effects, too!
__Leonard Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon.  Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn.
__Sheldon Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects.
__Penny Guess who?
__Howard What are you doing back?
__Bernadette That's an excellent question. Amy?
__Amy Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.
__Bernadette Long story short, she's on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.
__Amy I'm sorry. I feel like such an idiot.
__Penny Oh, it's not so bad. You lost money, you're filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that's Vegas, you nailed it.
__Amy You guys enjoy your evening. I'm gonna go before I ruin anybody else's weekend.
__Sheldon Ah, that's my girl.
__Leonard No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it's not the night you had in mind, but why don't you guys stay and play with us? It'll be fun.
__Sheldon It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?
__Leonard What's the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.
__Sheldon Well, I've just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.
__Penny Oh, don't worry, sweetie. No one has.
__Leonard So, what do you say?
__Sheldon I'll leave it up to the dungeon master.
__Howard A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  You're playing D&D. You're playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.
__Sheldon Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don't consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.
__Penny Oh, this isn't alcohol. It's a magic potion that makes me like you.
__Leonard Double potion, please.
__Howard Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!
__Sheldon Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.
__Howard What do you do?
__Leonard I draw my broadsword.
__Sheldon I ready my quarter-staff.
__Penny I drink my potion.
__Bernadette I say we attack the big one.
__Penny You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.
__Howard The dungeon master's supposed to roll.
__Penny Yeah, well I'm supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?
__Howard Uh, fifteen or higher.
__Penny Fifteen's the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we're playing for money.
__Sheldon Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.
__Penny More potion, please.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Lucy Kind of funky.
__Raj That's great.
__Lucy It is? Does funky mean something different in India?
__Raj No, no. Uh, you've always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here's your chance.
__Lucy Mmm, it's okay. I just won't eat 'em.
__Raj Don't be ridiculous. Waiter?
__Waiter Everything all right?
__Lucy Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?
__Waiter Yes.
__Lucy ‘Kay, thanks, bye.
__Raj Hold on. Isn't there something else you wanted to tell him?
__Lucy N-No, it, it's fine. Uh, He's from a different country, he doesn't understand our ways.
__Raj Don't be silly. Just tell him.
__Lucy I have to go to the bathroom. And it's not because the crab cakes are funky.
__Waiter So you're okay here?
__Raj Uh, yeah, sorry. She's just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.
__Howard Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.
__Sheldon That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.
__Leonard All right, Amy, there's one ogre left. Take him out.
__Amy Okay.
__Penny Pretend he's that TSA agent. Come on.
__Amy Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.
__Lucy Hey. Long time no see.
__Raj You don't know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.
__Lucy I'm sorry.
__Raj Why would you leave like that?
__Lucy You were pushing me. I clearly didn't want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.
__Raj Okay, if I upset you, then why didn't you just say something?
__Raj Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that's scary for me. Mostly because you're a proven flight risk.
__Lucy How could you like me a lot?
__Raj Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don't know. I just, I think you're wonderful.
__Lucy I'm sweating out of my head.
__Sheldon Yay!
__Howard But wait., he's not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.
__Sheldon Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn't he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?
__Howard Fine.  You'd think, after all these years, I'd know not to fly over volcanoes. I'm a freaking idiot.
__Sheldon The dragon's Christopher Walken. That's perfect.
__Leonard All right, Amy, it's your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.
__Amy Here we go. Fifteen?
__Howard It's a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.
__Sheldon Wait. Wait. And says?
__Howard Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.
__Sheldon Oh, I don't know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.
__Bernadette This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.
__Howard Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I'm gonna take you on a whole different adventure.
__Sheldon Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
__Sheldon Oh, then I'm out.
__Penny Ooh, I have an idea. Since it's not happening any time soon, why don't your character and your character do it in the game?
__Bernadette Ooh! Come on, back me up here.
__Howard Oh.
__Leonard Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.
__Howard The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he's ever seen, and he's overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, 'cause apparently she's into that. What do you do?
__Amy I don't like this.
__Sheldon You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
__Amy What?
__Sheldon I've never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
__Sheldon Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.
__Amy I'll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.
__Sheldon Well, I don't think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?', that's a joke. It's a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.
__Amy Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?
__Sheldon Oh, my. That's an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.
__Amy And now?
__Sheldon And now what?
__Amy Do you have any interest now?
__Sheldon I have not ruled it out.
__Amy Wow. Talk dirty to me.
__Sheldon I know it doesn't seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.
__Amy I guess I know that. It's just, part of me wants more.
__Sheldon More? I mean, look at us. It's only been three years, here we are in bed together.
__Amy Come on. Let's go back out there.
__Sheldon Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't see that through.
__Amy Okay.
__Sheldon I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off.
__Amy Oh.
__Sheldon What do you do?
__Amy I kiss you on the lips.
__Sheldon I kiss you back on the  lips as well. Your turn.
__Amy I remove your armour. What do you do?
__Sheldon I erotically caress your  nose.
__Amy Keep rolling.
__Sheldon We're fine, thank you.
__Penny Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…
__Amy Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my  14! Yes!
__Leonard Oh, that sounds romantic.
__Leonard So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?
__Raj I'd love that, but she's not really comfortable around people.
__Sheldon Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.
__Leonard How's that been working for you?
__Sheldon Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.
__Howard Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.
__Sheldon Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.
__Howard No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.
__Leonard Well, do you really think I have a shot?
__Howard Yeah, I've worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.
__Leonard He knows, wow.
__Sheldon Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
__Sheldon No one asked you, Uhura.
__Leonard What do you think?
__Sheldon Great. I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
__Leonard Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
__Sheldon Well, that's the thing about factoids, they're interesting.
__Leonard I know what you're doing. You don't want me going on this research trip because you're afraid to be alone.
__Sheldon I'm not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon Fine, no more drowning talk. I'll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?
__Leonard Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me.
__Sheldon Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn't change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?
__ Credits sequence.
__Lucy Wow. Your friend was actually up there?
__Raj Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
__Lucy Did he take the T-shirt to space?
__Raj Nope. It's exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?
__Lucy I don't know. How many are there?
__Raj Let's see. Six. That's pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.
__Lucy Six strangers? That's a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?
__Raj Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?
__Lucy Will you be there?
__Raj Of course.
__Lucy Well, that's two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand.
__Leonard Oh, that's awful.
__Penny Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.
__Leonard So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?
__Penny I thought I said that to you.
__Leonard Anyway, Stephen Hawking's team is looking into that, and I've been invited to join them.
__Penny Wow, Hawking. Good for you.
__Leonard Well, it is. Just, you know, I'd be gone for a while.
__Penny Well, how long?
__Leonard Three, four months.
__Penny Whoa. When would you leave?
__Leonard Couple of weeks.
__Penny Wow. Oh, okay, well, I'll just come visit you.
__Leonard That's the thing, you can't. I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.
__Penny On a ship? Aren't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
__Leonard Uh, he's not gonna be there. He's just sending a team to research his theory.
__Penny Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.
__Leonard Yeah. And I'm a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I'd hate to do anything that screws that up.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, if you're gonna screw things up, it's gonna be while you're here, not while you're away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I'm just basing that on how much I didn't understand what you said about it.
__Leonard Okay. I'll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
__Penny Okay. Good.
__Leonard I do have to ask you one favour.
__Penny Sure.
__Leonard Sheldon's nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone.
__Penny Oh, I don't know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?
__Leonard Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.
__Howard Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they're actually going on a voyage?
__Amy Hello, Rajesh.
__Howard Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It's funnier with the accent.
__Leonard There's beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don't need to make a big deal.
__Sheldon Leonard, you're being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we'll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.
__Penny Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.
__Bernadette You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.
__Penny Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.
__Raj Okay. I have a request to make.
__Amy And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck's going on in there.
__Raj The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.
__Sheldon Oh, gee, I don't know. My schedule's a little busy.
__Raj Actually, I was thinking Leonard.
__Leonard Oh. Thank you, Raj. I'd be honoured.
__Howard What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.
__Raj You are, but you've got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.
__Penny You know, maybe she'd be more comfortable meeting a girl first.
__Raj Good idea. Bernadette?
__Penny What the hell?
__Raj Well, you're very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.
__Penny Oh, yeah.
__Bernadette Hey, you don't think I'm pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?
__Howard Calm down, Bernie. You're very scary.
__Amy It should be me.
__Raj Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
__Amy A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.
__Sheldon Fine, I'll do it.
__Lucy That's really nice to hear.
__Amy Maybe next week, we could all get together.
__Raj Oh, Lucy, you don't have to answer that. Don't put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.
__Raj What the? Are you crazy? You can't talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
__Amy Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist. I think I'm a little more qualified than you to understand what's not working in your girlfriend's brain!
__Raj Don't call her my girlfriend. We haven't discussed whether or not we're girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it's out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I'll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.
__Lucy I think I have to go to the bathroom.
__Raj We might as well go ahead and eat. She's not coming back anytime soon.
__Penny Yeah, it does, and here we are.
__Sheldon You know, I have to say, Penny, I don't understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.
__Penny Well, I'm his girlfriend, of course I'm gonna support him.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, you're his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you're not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other's arms and britches.
__Penny Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.
__Sheldon It's not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking's theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I'm interested in the big questions.
__Penny Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.
__Sheldon I'm not jealous. I'm just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
__Penny Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn't take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn't very good at her job.
__Sheldon It was you.
__Sheldon You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
__Penny I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I'm happy for you. Because that's what friends do.
__Sheldon They lie so they don't look petty.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon How?
__Penny Like this. I am so happy for you.
__Sheldon Wow. No wonder you didn't get that toothpaste commercial.
__Lucy Hi.
__Raj I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?
__Lucy Amy wasn't the problem.
__Raj Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.
__Lucy Thank you.
__Raj You know, I, I've been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.
__Lucy A party?
__Raj A little one. It's, it's a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won't even know you're there.
__Lucy I'm not sure.
__Raj Oh, please?
__Lucy Raj.
__Raj Come on. Don't make me beg. And I'm from India, so I know how to do it.
__Lucy Okay.
__Raj Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don't like them, in which case, they're dead to me.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Bernadette Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Howard I'm proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that's really something.
__Leonard I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.
__Howard Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.
__Leonard It's not a competition.
__Howard You're right, you're right. I'm really proud of you, and I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. And space beats water.
__Amy Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.
__Raj She is. She's just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She'll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?
__Sheldon Um, can I have your attention, everyone?  That's, uh, B-flat, for those who don't have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn't be happier for him.
__Leonard Thank you, Sheldon. That must've been very hard for you to say.
__Sheldon Well, I mean it. I'm really happy for you. And that's how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.
__Howard Cheers.
__Penny Cheers.
__Howard It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Howard It must've killed you when I went to space.
__Raj Oh, no.
__Howard Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.
__Bernadette What's going on?
__Raj Uh, go ahead. Read it.
__Howard Raj, I can't come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don't think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.
__Raj Excuse me.
__Penny Raj, I'm so sorry.
__Amy Me, too.
__Sheldon It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.
__Leonard Yep. I'm really gonna miss you.
__Penny I'm gonna miss you, too.
__Sheldon Penny, we're in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We're breaking the law.
__Penny Okay, there's no space in the white zone, so…
__Leonard Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.
__Sheldon All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I'm not going to jail for you.
__Leonard Would you just relax?
__Sheldon Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.
__Penny Did you bring enough inhalers?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It's a Small World.
__Leonard I'm covered.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord, a police officer's glancing in our direction. We've been made.
__Penny Oh, Leonard.
__Sheldon It's just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard's face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.
__Penny I love you.
__Leonard I love you, too.
__Sheldon Don't worry, Officer. They just love each other. We're not smuggling drugs.
__Raj Hang on.
__Penny Hey. I'm just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you're doing.
__Raj That's, that's very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in.
__Penny Can't stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He's gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?
__Raj No.
__Penny Oh. I'm so sorry.
__Raj No. It's my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.
__Raj Penny, I, I miss her already.
__Penny I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.
__Raj What's like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can't I ever have love?
__Penny You will.
__Raj No, I, I won't. I'm, I'm unlovable.
__Penny That's just the booze talking.
__Raj No, it's not. I haven't had a drink since last night.
__Penny You're talking to me.
__Raj I am. And now I'm crying for a whole different reason!
__Penny Oh, me, too.
__Penny That's great. Do you want some wine?
__Raj Uh, no, water's fine. Anyhow, I've been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there's still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…
__Amy Does he ever shut up?
__Raj … but then it turns good again, and that means it's better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing's aren't good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I'm a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it's not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining….
__Sheldon Hello to you, too. I'm sorry, but this is important.
__Sheldon Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?
__Leonard Sheldon, I got to go inside. It's getting rough out here.
__Sheldon You're dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?
__Leonard What was what?
__Sheldon This isn't a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.
__Leonard Okay, I'm hanging up now. You know there's no such thing as a k…
__Sheldon No!
__Penny What's the matter?
__Sheldon Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you'd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.
__Penny Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?
__Sheldon To be honest, I did.
__Penny Aw.
__Sheldon Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.
__Penny Good night.
__Sheldon No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don't miss Leonard as much, uh, 'cause you're being kind of a baby about it.
__Penny You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard I'm proud of you.
__Raj Well, you should be, 'cause she was looking good.
__Sheldon Dear Lord, you're an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.
__Raj Is that true?
__Sheldon Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.
__Raj How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy's face? Tell me you don't see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.
__Howard Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there's a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn't made of grease or pie.
__Raj You think you're so cool because your wife is a person?
__Howard Look, Bernie's at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I'll go with you.
__Raj You would do that for me?
__Howard Of course. You're my friend. I want you to be happy.
__Raj Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy's out of town, would you like to join us?
__Sheldon I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.
__Amy Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs.
__Bernadette The hotel's nice. There's a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun.
__Amy Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.
__Bernadette Aw, I love you, too. If I don't talk to you before you go to sleep, I'll meet you in dreamland.
__Amy Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Well, now that I've piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.
__Penny Why don't you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?
__Sheldon You overestimate his significance in my life.
__Penny Mmm.
__Sheldon Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don't think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code?
__Penny Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.
__Sheldon Well, I try.
__Penny All right, let's just get this stupid game over with.
__Sheldon Great. I'll go first.
__Penny Okay.
__Penny Why?
__Sheldon Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one's gone all cattywampus.
__Girl It is. You can download my paper off the university server.
__Raj I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.
__Girl I will.
__Raj All right.
__Howard How'd it go?
__Raj Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.
__Howard Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She's probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.
__Raj Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.
__Howard I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.
__Raj That's so much better than the old, ugly ones.
__Mrs Davis Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.
__Howard Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.
__Mrs Davis Okay.
__Raj So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they're adorable.
__Howard It was better when you couldn't talk to women.
__Amy Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they're yours, then they're a drag.
__Bernadette To the advancement of science.
__Amy And to the sick and dying who make it possible.
__Bernadette This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.
__Amy Which is fine, but it's nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.
__Waiter From the two gentlemen at the bar.
__Amy Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.
__Bernadette Be cool.
__Amy You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.
__Bernadette You're right. Thank you.
__Penny Really? Why?
__Sheldon My queen can now take your rook from below.
__Penny So that means I lose, right? It's over?
__Sheldon If I make this move, but I won't because we're having too much fun.
__Penny Okay, let's take a break.
__Sheldon We're all out of alcohol.
__Penny I wasn't going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard's doing right now. I miss him so much.
__Sheldon Well, if you'd like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I've explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.
__Penny I'm calling him.
__Sheldon Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.
__Leonard Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?
__Penny Leonard?
__Leonard Penny? Hey, it's Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.
__Everybody Hi, Penny!
__Penny Wow, it sounds like you're having a good time.
__Leonard Best time of my life.
__Sheldon Isn't it five thirty in the morning there?
__Leonard Is it? Hey, everybody, it's five thirty in the morning!
__Penny Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.
__Random voice Iceberg!
__Leonard Uh-oh, hang on.
__Sheldon Are you in danger?
__Leonard No, it's a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!
__Everybody Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!
__Penny Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.
__Sheldon You were.
__Bernadette It's fine. I thanked them again and let them know we're not available.
__Amy So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?
__Bernadette Yes, it's all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.
__Amy And why would no one blame me?
__Bernadette I don't know what I'm saying.
__Amy Well, it sounds like you're saying that I could do better than Sheldon.
__Bernadette Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I'm gonna be huggin' the toilet tonight.
__Amy No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.
__Bernadette I just meant that you're not married and your boyfriend's kind of, Sheldon.
__Amy And your husband is extremely Howard. What's your point?
__Bernadette Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?
__Amy We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.
__Bernadette Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?
__Amy Sure.
__Bernadette Thanks.
__Amy Your husband's weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
__Sheldon That you're having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
__Penny No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
__Sheldon Allow me to comfort you. At least you've got your health.
__Penny Really? That, that's it? That's comforting?
__Sheldon Um, uh, in a hundred years, you'll both be dead and it won't matter?
__Penny No. Come on, you're supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he's partying is to cover up his pain.
__Sheldon Oh, no, I don't think that's true at all.
__Penny This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he's off having a good time?
__Sheldon Well, perhaps you're obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?
__Penny Okay, that, that's great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.
__Sheldon Actually, I can't. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I'd take care of you.
__Penny He did?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Oh, that's really sweet.
__Sheldon Plus, if I do a good job, he said he'd bring me back a sailor's cap.
__Penny Well, now I miss him even more.
__Sheldon Well, if it's any consolation, I'm sure Leonard's tormented every moment he's away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.
__Penny Thanks.
__Sheldon Oh, seriously?
__Mrs Davis What?
__Raj I'd like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.
__Mrs Davis Forget about it.
__Raj You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.
__Mrs Davis Is that right?
__Raj Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I'll tell you about it.
__Penny Come on. It's still early. Let's do something.
__Sheldon Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.
__Penny How about we just talk?
__Sheldon All right. In 4D chess…
__Penny No. Come on, let's talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don't know.
__Sheldon I own nine pairs of pants.
__Penny Okay, that, that's a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.
__Sheldon I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.
__Penny How about I go first?
__Sheldon But I don't want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I'd say it's a thousand.
__Penny Okay, look, here's something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.
__Sheldon I've seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.
__Penny Oh, God.
__Sheldon And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you're going for. Okay, here's one I thought I'd take to the grave.
__Penny Okay.
__Penny That's your big revelation?
__Sheldon Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.
__Penny Okay, you know what? I give up. I'm going to bed.
__Sheldon Here's something else you don't know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
__Penny What did I do?
__Sheldon I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.
__Penny I, I didn't think it was a big deal.
__Sheldon It is to me; that's the point.
__Penny Sheldon, you are right. I'm really sorry. I should've known better.
__Sheldon Your apology is accepted.
__Penny Thank you. How about a hug?
__Sheldon How about a hearty handshake?
__Penny Come on.
__Sheldon Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
__Amy Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
__Bernadette Yeah, that felt nice.
__Amy Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
__Bernadette So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?
__Amy I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
__Amy Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It'd be nice to be with a man who wants to know what's underneath my cardigan. FYI, it's another cardigan.
__Bernadette Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.
__Amy Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.
__Both Good night.
__Raj Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.
__Mrs Davis Yeah, it's exactly the same thing. Good night.
__Raj Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That's a much better evening. You're a lovely person.
__Mrs Davis Are you hitting on me?
__Raj No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you'd know it 'cause you'd feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.
__Mrs Davis You're sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.
__Raj Good night.
__Howard Looks like she accepted your apology.
__Raj And then some. I think we had a moment.
__Howard Oh, please, you did not have a moment.
__Raj Who died and made you king of moments?
__Howard Okay, fine. Let's say there was a moment.
__Raj There was.
__Howard There wasn't. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?
__Raj I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.
__Raj No, not a thing.
__Leonard That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.
__Everyone Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!
__Penny Aaaaaaah!
__Penny Another? Great.
__Penny Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
__Sheldon Joke if you must, but you're going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.
__Penny You know, I will miss this.
__Sheldon I'll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we'll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard's return as criticism of the job you've been doing in his absence.
__Penny I won't.
__Sheldon That criticism will come later in your report card.
__Penny Yeah, I didn't stay for the detention, I'm not gonna read the report card.
__Leonard Leonard (in Penny's apartment): Hello.
__Penny Leonard! Hi!
__Leonard Keep your voice down.
__Penny Oh, my God. You weren't supposed to be here till Sunday.
__Leonard We finished the experiment early, so I thought I'd come home and surprise you.
__Penny Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?
__Leonard I didn't tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.
__Penny Oh, that is so romantic.
__Leonard Uh, sure, that's why I did it.
__Penny Oh, I just cannot believe you're here.
__ Credits sequence.
__Stuart Happy to, unless it's hope or a reason to live.
__Sheldon Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he's been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.
__Stuart Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.
__Sheldon Aquaman? Oh, this isn't a gag gift, Stuart.
__Stuart Yeah, just as well. It's a pretty rare piece. I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.
__Sheldon I'm a real collector. How rare is it?
__Stuart Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?
__Sheldon Don't try and trick me into buying something I don't want. Now let's talk Aquaman.
__Howard What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus's mind in Spider-Man's body?
__Raj Well, I've been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.
__Howard original and Lohan. You're an idiot.
__Raj Hey, what's your problem?
__Howard I'm sorry, I've been kind of snippy lately. It's probably this stupid diet I'm on.
__Raj Why are you on a diet?
__Howard I've put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men's section.
__Raj Well, we've all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
__Sheldon Twelve hundred dollars. That's my final offer.
__Stuart All right, Sheldon, you win. I'm sure Leonard is gonna love this.
__Sheldon Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.
__Stuart Ooh, yeah, I don't know. This squirt gun, it's, uh, it's pretty rare.
__Sheldon Oh.
__Penny Ah.
__Leonard And, oh, that's me getting rescued after I fell in.
__Penny Oh.  Oh, that's the pizza.
__Leonard Yep. Here's some money.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard And I'm gonna hit the head. That's what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
__Penny Hey.
__Pizza guy Twenty-two fifty.
__Penny Okay, here's, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.
__Pizza guy Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.
__Penny Oh. Okay. Well, here's, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won't call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.
__Sheldon Oh, Penny, I see you've ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.
__Penny That's nice.
__Penny Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…
__Sheldon Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.
__Penny Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.  Have a good night!
__Sheldon What, now, do you have company?
__Penny No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet's been doing that. I called the building manager, so…
__Sheldon Oh, I can take a look at it.
__Penny Well…
__Sheldon I'm quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.
__Penny Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it's okay. You don't have to go into the bathroom.
__Sheldon That's curious. If there's no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?
__Penny Oh. Well, you know, I, I've got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.
__Sheldon Of course. Ask a silly question.
__Penny Oh.
__Sheldon That's odd.
__Penny Um, what?
__Sheldon There are takeout containers in the trash can.
__Penny So? That's my dinner from last night.
__Sheldon What's odd is they're in the trash can.
__Penny Okay. Look, honey, I promise there's no one's here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.
__Sheldon Oh, very well. I'm no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?
__Howard Hey.
__Bernadette I made some brownies. You want one?
__Howard You're kidding, right? I mean, you know I'm trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.
__Bernadette We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you're not fat.
__Howard Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, 'cause one of you is lying.
__Bernadette Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom's?
__Howard Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.
__Bernadette Why can't she do it?
__Howard ‘Cause we've got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn't take into account the square footage of her back.
__Bernadette Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?
__Howard I don't know. Few weeks. Why?
__Bernadette This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you've been wearing gloves.
__Howard Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
__Bernadette Howie, the oestrogen's getting absorbed by your skin. That's why you've been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.
__Bernadette That's 'cause I'm a woman. I've had years of practice riding the dragon.
__Howard Fine. I'll wear gloves next time.
__Bernadette It's still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
__Howard I feel so stupid. And fat.
__Bernadette It's okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don't we go in the bedroom and I'll prove it to you?
__Howard Sex? Really? I mean, that's just your solution to everything.
__Sheldon Yes, I am.
__Amy Then what does tweepadock mean?
__Sheldon Uh, elephant?
__Amy Lucky guess.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I'm just distracted by something that happened over at Penny's.
__Amy What happened?
__Sheldon I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.
__Amy What?
__Sheldon She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.
__Amy I don't think Penny would cheat on Leonard.
__Sheldon Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It's a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.
__Amy You're being ridiculous.
__Sheldon Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.
__Amy Poor Leonard.
__Sheldon I hear a woman's voice.
__Amy Is it Penny?
__Sheldon No, it's you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.
__Amy Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.
__Sheldon There's kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.
__Amy Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.
__Sheldon Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that's it. I'm catching her in the act.
__Amy No, Sheldon, don't.
__Sheldon Aha.
__Penny What the hell?
__Sheldon Leonard?
__Penny Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.
__Sheldon Right.   Penny.  Penny.  Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?
__Sheldon Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.
__Leonard That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
__Sheldon Oh, no, no, let's not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.
__Penny No, he doesn't.
__Sheldon Well, Leonard, I think it's high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.
__Leonard The what?
__Sheldon Amy?
__Amy Please leave me out of this.
__Sheldon Fine. Leonard, there's no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.
__Leonard Come on, I said I was sorry.
__Sheldon No, no, you save your apologies for after you've had disappointing coitus with Penny.
__Penny It was fine.
__Leonard Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It's that sailor cap that you wanted. It's neat, huh?
__Sheldon You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
__Leonard I don't. I really don't. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.
__Amy Hello, sailor.
__Penny Ooh, now we're talking.
__Raj No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.
__Howard Yeah, that's cucumber and cream cheese. That's turkey and loganberry. And don't tell my hips, but I'm warming up a brie in the oven.
__Raj Nice. So, mmm. What's up?
__Howard Okay, well, I've been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?
__Raj Well, it's kind of hard to tell.
__Howard Come on, Raj, it's a yes or no question.
__Raj I'm not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let's see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can't tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.
__Howard Seriously?
__Raj Do you want my help or not?
__Raj Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.
__Howard Yeah, they kind of do.
__Raj Hmm. Uh, let me see something.
__Howard Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.
__Raj Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay.  I mean, yeah, maybe.
__Howard Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.
__Raj You know, but, but they're very firm, so you've got that going for you.
__Howard You think?
__Raj Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.
__Howard Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.  Ooh, brie's ready.
__Raj Yay.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
__Sheldon I'd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
__Leonard Where do you think I would take you?
__Sheldon Who knows? Uh, you said you'd be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you're taking me to work, but for all I know, I'll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.
__Leonard I'm going to work. You can come if you want.
__Sheldon Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.
__Sheldon Hurts, doesn't it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you've ever told me is true.
__Leonard I didn't make it back. The ship sank, I'm in hell.
__Sheldon You say you're from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?
__Leonard Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren't?
__Sheldon All right, I'll give you that one.
__Leonard Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
__Sheldon I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
__Leonard Fine. What I did was wrong.
__Sheldon I wish I could believe you.
__Leonard You know what? I'm not driving you to work, because you're incredibly annoying.
__Sheldon You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.
__Leonard Stop it.
__Sheldon Keep it up?
__Leonard Bye.
__Sheldon Hello. So I guess you're really holding up the other four fingers?
__Amy Driving Sheldon to work.
__Penny He's still mad at Leonard, huh?
__Amy Well, he's mad at you, too. He says you're the succubus who led his friend astray.
__Penny I don't know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can't be good.
__Sheldon Thought I heard you out here.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You don't get a hey. You get a hmm.
__Penny Come on, don't be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.
__Sheldon You're right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
__Penny Sheldon.
__Amy Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard. Penny's got nothing to do…
__Sheldon Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy's girlfriend is my enemy.
__Amy Really?
__Sheldon Yes. You're either with me or against me.
__Amy You want to take the bus to work?
__Sheldon Maybe there's a third option.
__Amy FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.
__Howard That's so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.
__Sheldon Howard, Raj. Judas.
__Leonard You know what? You're a crazy person.
__Sheldon A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.
__Howard Stop it.
__Sheldon Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
__Howard I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren't just friends. You're best friends. And that's a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he's so mad at you? It's 'cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.
__Raj A little loud, dude.
__Howard So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we're here together?
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon I suppose so.
__Howard Thank you.
__Raj Uh, it wasn't anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.
__Leonard I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.
__Penny I'm so glad you guys are friends again.
__Sheldon And I'm glad you and I are friends again, too.
__Penny Aw.
__Penny Fifty cents off Vagisil.
__Sheldon Think of me when you apply it.
__Raj Uh, can I just say, I've missed all of us hanging out together.
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Penny Me, too.
__ Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?
__ Oh, that happened right after you left.
__ And no one told me?
__ Can't believe we forgot to tell him.
__ Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
__Penny Another? Great.
__Sheldon Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.
__Penny Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
__Sheldon Joke if you must, but you're going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.
__Penny You know, I will miss this.
__Sheldon I'll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we'll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard's return as criticism of the job you've been doing in his absence.
__Penny I won't.
__Sheldon That criticism will come later in your report card.
__Penny Yeah, I didn't stay for the detention, I'm not gonna read the report card.
__Leonard Leonard (in Penny's apartment): Hello.
__Penny Leonard! Hi!
__Leonard Keep your voice down.
__Penny Oh, my God. You weren't supposed to be here till Sunday.
__Leonard We finished the experiment early, so I thought I'd come home and surprise you.
__Penny Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?
__Leonard I didn't tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.
__Penny Oh, that is so romantic.
__Leonard Uh, sure, that's why I did it.
__Penny Oh, I just cannot believe you're here.
__Sheldon Penny, it's your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.
__ Credits sequence.
__Stuart Happy to, unless it's hope or a reason to live.
__Sheldon Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he's been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.
__Stuart Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.
__Sheldon Aquaman? Oh, this isn't a gag gift, Stuart.
__Stuart Yeah, just as well. It's a pretty rare piece. I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.
__Sheldon I'm a real collector. How rare is it?
__Stuart Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?
__Sheldon Don't try and trick me into buying something I don't want. Now let's talk Aquaman.
__Howard What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus's mind in Spider-Man's body?
__Raj Well, I've been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.
__Howard original and Lohan. You're an idiot.
__Raj Hey, what's your problem?
__Howard I'm sorry, I've been kind of snippy lately. It's probably this stupid diet I'm on.
__Raj Why are you on a diet?
__Howard I've put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men's section.
__Raj Well, we've all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
__Sheldon Twelve hundred dollars. That's my final offer.
__Stuart All right, Sheldon, you win. I'm sure Leonard is gonna love this.
__Sheldon Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.
__Stuart Ooh, yeah, I don't know. This squirt gun, it's, uh, it's pretty rare.
__Sheldon Oh.
__Penny Ah.
__Leonard And, oh, that's me getting rescued after I fell in.
__Penny Oh.  Oh, that's the pizza.
__Leonard Yep. Here's some money.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard And I'm gonna hit the head. That's what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
__Penny Hey.
__Pizza guy Twenty-two fifty.
__Penny Okay, here's, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.
__Pizza guy Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.
__Penny Oh. Okay. Well, here's, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won't call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.
__Sheldon Oh, Penny, I see you've ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.
__Penny That's nice.
__Sheldon Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.
__Penny Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…
__Sheldon Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.
__Penny Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.  Have a good night!
__Sheldon What, now, do you have company?
__Penny No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet's been doing that. I called the building manager, so…
__Sheldon Oh, I can take a look at it.

__Sheldon Well, Leonard, I think it's high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.
__Leonard The what?
__Sheldon Amy?
__Amy Please leave me out of this.
__Sheldon Fine. Leonard, there's no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.
__Sheldon No, no, you save your apologies for after you've had disappointing coitus with Penny.
__Penny It was fine.
__Leonard Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It's that sailor cap that you wanted. It's neat, huh?
__Sheldon You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
__Leonard I don't. I really don't. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.
__Amy Hello, sailor.
__Penny Ooh, now we're talking.
__Sheldon Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I'm wearing this year. Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.
__Raj No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.
__Howard Yeah, that's cucumber and cream cheese. That's turkey and loganberry. And don't tell my hips, but I'm warming up a brie in the oven.
__Raj Nice. So, mmm. What's up?
__Howard Okay, well, I've been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?

__Howard Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.
__Raj You know, but, but they're very firm, so you've got that going for you.
__Howard You think?
__Raj Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.
__Howard Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.  Ooh, brie's ready.
__Raj Yay.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
__Sheldon I'd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
__Sheldon Who knows? Uh, you said you'd be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you're taking me to work, but for all I know, I'll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.

__Leonard No, I don't.
__Sheldon Hurts, doesn't it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you've ever told me is true.

__Penny Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You don't get a hey. You get a hmm.
__Penny Come on, don't be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.
__Sheldon You're right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
__Penny Sheldon.
__Sheldon I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I'm going to get in the mail now?
__Amy Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard. Penny's got nothing to do…
__Sheldon Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy's girlfriend is my enemy.
__Amy Really?
__Sheldon Yes. You're either with me or against me.
__Amy You want to take the bus to work?
__Sheldon Maybe there's a third option.
__Amy FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.
__Howard That's so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.
__Sheldon Howard, Raj. Judas.
__Leonard You know what? You're a crazy person.
__Sheldon A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.
__Howard Stop it.
__Sheldon Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
__Howard I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren't just friends. You're best friends. And that's a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he's so mad at you? It's 'cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.
__Raj A little loud, dude.
__Howard So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we're here together?
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon I suppose so.
__Howard Thank you.
__Raj Uh, it wasn't anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.
__Leonard I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.
__Penny I'm so glad you guys are friends again.
__Sheldon And I'm glad you and I are friends again, too.
__Penny Aw.
__Sheldon Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.
__Penny Fifty cents off Vagisil.
__Sheldon Think of me when you apply it.
__Raj Uh, can I just say, I've missed all of us hanging out together.
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Penny Me, too.
__ Oh, that happened right after you left.
__ And no one told me?
__ Can't believe we forgot to tell him.
__ Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.
__Raj No, you weren't because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.
__Amy We're sorry, Rajesh.
__Bernadette Maybe we can do it next week.
__Howard Whoa, whoa, we're not that sorry.
__Raj Don't worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.
__Leonard Great.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Howard Hallelujah.
__Raj Because I've got something even better planned.
__Leonard Aw.
__Howard Why?
__Sheldon Come on.
__Raj Just hear me out. I'm going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
__Howard Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.
__Leonard We did them at Princeton, too.
__Howard Oh, that's cute. Like it's a real college.
__Sheldon That's amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.
__Amy Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story's more sad than funny.
__Penny I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.
__Leonard Oh, these are a little different. There's a tradition at elite universities…
__Howard And Princeton.
__Leonard A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.
__Penny Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.
__Raj So, uh, who's in?
__Leonard I think it sounds fun.
__Amy Yeah, me, too.
__Various I'm in, let's do it.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.
__Leonard You really think he's gonna send us to a bowling alley?
__Sheldon Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.
__Raj Okay, everybody. Who's ready for a scavenger hunt?  Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I've hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p…  each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.
__Sheldon He is a born showman.
__Raj Any questions?
__Howard Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?
__Leonard It's not funny.
__Leonard Ha-ha.
__Sheldon Oh, see? Now he gets it.
__Raj Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.
__Bernadette Should we just do couples?
__Leonard Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.
__Penny Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don't you just admit you don't want to be on a team with me.
__Leonard I just said, couples sound great.
__Penny Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't think I'm smart enough. You think I'm gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.
__Leonard All right, let's, let's do couples. I want to.
__Penny No, no. Let's mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we're gonna kick your ass!
__Sheldon Really? The only time I'm ever picked first for a team and I'm stuck with the liability?
__Amy Stop that. Penny is not a liability.
__Penny Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
__Amy Maybe we pick names out of a hat.
__Sheldon Yes, and do you know what the odds are I'd pick your name?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon It's not hard, one in five. Now you know why I'm pouting.
__Raj Raj (over walkie-talkie): All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.
__Sheldon What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.
__Penny Well, there's no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.
__Howard Wow, you're really good at puzzles.
__Amy I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you're doing a puzzle, it's like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.
__Howard If it makes you feel any better, my mom's just full of pound cake.
__Amy I'm sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.
__Howard Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?
__Amy No.
__Howard Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
__Bernadette Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!
__Leonard Stop yelling at me.
__Bernadette Hey, you'll know when I'm yelling at you.
__Penny Ooh, ooh, it's the comic book store. All right, come on, that's where we have to go.
__Sheldon But we haven't finished the puzzle.
__Penny But, it, it doesn't matter. We know the answer, come on.
__Sheldon You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle's complete, there's a sign in the window that says go to the train store?
__Penny Okay, it's not gonna say that.
__Sheldon Well, I hope you're wrong. I really want to go to the train store.
__Howard It's the comic book store. Let's go.
__Bernadette Come on, numb nuts, it's the comic book store.
__Penny It's the comic book store, it's the comic book store, it's the comic book store.
__Sheldon It's the comic book store.
__Bernadette Because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it? I'm sure she finds it charming.
__Bernadette I'm starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.
__Leonard Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.
__Bernadette Yeah, I know. Its, it's probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?
__Howard Huh, I guess you're right. Wonder why that is?
__Amy Well, off the top of my head, I'd say we don't have a lot in common except for the people we're involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.
__Howard Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.
__Howard I don't know. Tell me some things you like.
__Amy Uh, let's see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…
__Howard Hey, how about some music?
__Amy Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn't want to be mistaken for a gang member.
__Howard Find something you like.
__Amy Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?
__Amy I love Neil Diamond.
__Both Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I've been inclined…
__Stuart Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn't invited to be a part of.
__Raj Oh, congratulations. You're the first team to arrive.
__Amy Yes, it's not a ruse to make fun of me. It's a real game and I'm winning it.
__Raj Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
__Bernadette Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I'm in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.
__Leonard I have asthma. Back off.
__Howard Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you'll see.
__Raj Good riddle, huh?
__Stuart Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?
__Raj I invited you to my murder mystery party.
__Stuart No, you didn't.
__Raj Oh.
__Penny Ugh, we're the last ones here, hurry up.
__Sheldon It is a marathon, not a sprint.
__Penny People run in a marathon.
__Sheldon Not with a bowling ball on their back.
__Leonard Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there's no hard feelings.
__Bernadette Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.
__Leonard Relax, it's a hard puzzle. It's gonna take a while to solve.
__Penny Riddle me this…
__Sheldon Got it.
__Penny Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.
__Sheldon I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
__Howard Hey, you know what this could mean
__Amy Oh, oh, that's good. Then this would be
__Howard That's it.
__Amy To the Neil Mobile.
__Bernadette I knew it, we're gonna lose.
__Leonard Wait, I got it. I got it/
__Bernadette Congratulations, you got it last.
__Leonard You're really mean, you know that?
__Stuart So no one's gonna buy anything.
__Sheldon The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
__Penny Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I've got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?
__Sheldon Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn't the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I'm going with this?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Nice try. Now, Element Lad's ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I'm just funnin' you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth's surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.
__Penny Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
__Sheldon And I'm sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you'll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who's made entirely of…
__Penny Shut up. I solved it.
__Sheldon Those are map coordinates. Got 'em. Let's go.
__Penny Well, wait. Don't you want to know how I figured it out?
__Sheldon No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.
__Amy They're coming to America.
__Howard Never looking back again.
__Amy They're coming to America… ♪
__Bernadette Don't sweat it, my dad's a cop. He can fix things.
__Leonard Uh-huh. Like death?
__Bernadette Your kid may be an honour student but you're a moron.
__Leonard Penny's not answering my texts.
__Bernadette Who cares? Focus on the game.
__Leonard This stupid game is why she's mad in the first place. I'm telling her I'm quitting.
__Bernadette No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
__Leonard Why?
__Bernadette Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.
__Bernadette How do I put this? She's been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.
__Leonard I can't believe she would say that about me.
__Bernadette If you're gonna cry about it there's tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.
__Amy Today!
__Howard Today!
__Together Today! Today!
__Penny Okay. Oh, it's a bowling alley.
__Amy Ain't no big surprise.
__Howard Just pour me a drink.
__Amy And I'll tell you some lies.
__Bernadette Can you reach the clue?
__Leonard Almost.
__Bernadette Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.
__Leonard Got it.
__Bernadette Great, climb back up. Come on.
__Penny Let's go.
__Howard Let's go.
__Sheldon It's dirty laundry. You're up.
__Penny What? Why me?
__Sheldon Because you've been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.
__Bernadette They're here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
__Penny Okay, the clue must be in the bag.
__Leonard The clue must be in the bag.
__Penny It's just a bunch of pants.
__Leonard It's just a bunch of pants.
__Penny You know, I'm surprised you want to copy my answers since I'm not even smart enough to be on your team.
__Leonard Well, why would you want to be on someone's team who you like to call a, I can't even say it in front of Sheldon.
__Penny What are you talking about?
__Leonard You know exactly what I'm talking about.
__Bernadette No, she doesn't. I just made that up.
__Leonard Why would you do that?
__Bernadette Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.
__Sheldon I'm not a child. I know the word ninny.
__Penny Yeah, well, you should have quit 'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.
__Bernadette Wish I had a man like her on my team.
__Leonard Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let's do this.
__Sheldon Wait, it's not all pants, there's one shirt.
__Penny Oh.
__Sheldon Hey, that's my shirt.
__Leonard This one is, too.
__Sheldon No, no, that's not mine. It has a big spot on it.
__Penny But wait. So does this one.
__Penny Sheldon's spot. The coin is in your spot.
__Sheldon Oh, that's clever.
__Penny Hurry.
__Sheldon Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.
__Penny Well, where the hell's the coin?
__Leonard Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot?
__Raj Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.
__Bernadette Then where's the coin?
__Raj Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don't you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.
__Penny I don't get it.
__Raj Don't you see? When we're all having fun together, we're already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I'm a winner.
__Leonard Are you kidding me?
__Penny That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
__Bernadette You suck so hard.
__Raj Well, I thought… Come on, I didn't want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn't know who was gonna get Penny.
__Penny Run.
__Raj Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.
__Penny Run to India.
__Raj I just wanted to do something beautiful.
__Sheldon Hey, look. I won.
__Amy She got the way to groove me.
__Howard Cherry, baby
__Amy She got the way to move me, honey.
__Together She got the way to groove me. She got the way to move me.
__Howard Cherry
__Together She got the way to groove me, yeah!
__Sheldon That's it? Good”
__Amy I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.
__Sheldon My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It's one of my all-time favourites.
__Amy It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
__Sheldon Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I've watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it's still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here's my jaw, drop it.
__Sheldon Oh, I see your confusion. You don't understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.
__Amy No, I do, and if he weren't in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.
__Leonard Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don't need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?
__Penny Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.
__Leonard You bought my mom's book?
__Penny Yeah. It's on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
__Leonard Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it's got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.
__Penny Oh, cool. Are there pictures?
__Leonard Seriously, please find another book.
__Penny Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?
__Leonard There, there's chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don't talk to me about it.
__Penny Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
__Leonard It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.
__Penny Oh, my God, you still go left.
__Howard Halle Berry. Why?
__Raj Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it's one of the questions. And thank you, I'd kill for that woman's bone structure.
__Leonard Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
__Sheldon I'll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I'm trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.
__Howard Because her life wasn't enough?
__Raj Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It's perfect.
__Sheldon Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.
__All Aw!
__Howard Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.
__Leonard Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.
__All Aw!
__Leonard No.
__Penny I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom's make-up and wears balloon boobies.
__Leonard They weren't boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.
__Penny You were wearing her bra.
__Leonard That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?
__Penny Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it's good to open up about these things.
__Leonard Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.
__Penny Well, why were you so angry?
__Leonard Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I'd keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.
__Penny Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.
__Leonard I do, too, but there's not.
__Penny Really? Are you sure about that?
__Leonard Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I'm gonna go right. Don't make a big deal out of it.
__Raj Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one's in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.
__Raj Okay, uh, let's try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn't want to hurt you.
__Stuart I don't think I can give you that.
__Raj Come on. One more time. Yeah, it's, it's a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?
__Stuart Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?
__Raj Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?
__Stuart I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I'm being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?
__Raj My parents' money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?
__Stuart not applicable.
__Raj Come on, dude, you're being too hard on yourself. You've got a lot of good stuff going on.
__Stuart Really? Like what?
__Raj Well, okay, you're a, you're a talented artist, you own your own business.
__Stuart Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.
__Raj Okay, well, can we imply that you're well-endowed?
__Stuart I do have one oddly long testicle.
__Raj Okay, now you're talking like a winner!
__Sheldon Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.
__Leonard Mm-hmm. And?
__Sheldon And I think I've got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?
__Leonard Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn't know how big he was gonna be.
__Sheldon Of course. You know, why couldn't she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing's riddled with plot holes.
__Leonard Sorry, buddy.
__Sheldon Ooh, I think she's a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.
__Leonard I'll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
__Sheldon Wait, hang on. You've spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she's fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn't noticed?
__Leonard I gotta go.
__Penny Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don't try and talk sports with the guys.
__Leonard Some sports bar. It's like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?
__Penny Oh, come on. Every time we're about to hang out with my friends, you don't want to. It's like, It's too loud, or the bathroom's too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…
__Leonard Well, you're, you're right. Let's just go.
__Penny Hey, what's going on with you?
__Leonard Nothing, I'm fine.
__Penny All right, hang on. is this still about your mom's book?
__Leonard No. Not everything is about my mom.
__Leonard Except this is totally about my mom.
__Penny I'm so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
__Leonard That sounds nice. Yeah.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.
__Leonard One sec. Hey. Sorry.
__Howard Hi, Penny.
__Penny Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.
__Leonard I'll try, but I might be sad again tonight.
__Penny Okay.
__Howard Wow. Sex at work?
__Leonard Leave it alone. That's my girlfriend.
__Howard Sorry.
__Leonard Who just had sex with me at work.
__Howard Damn. How'd you swing that?
__Leonard Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.
__Howard Seriously?
__Leonard Look, I mean, I'm not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she'd make it to the end.
__Howard You sound kind of proud of it.
__Leonard I am, I'm really proud.
__Sheldon Yes. Why?
__Amy Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.
__Sheldon April 13, a dark night, indeed.
__Amy So what can I do for you?
__Sheldon I'm calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
__Amy Really?
__Amy That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?
__Sheldon Um, I'm putting on lotion. Are you in or not?
__Amy Of course I'm in.
__Sheldon Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.
__Amy Good night, Dr. Cooper.
__Sheldon Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?
__Howard Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.
__Bernadette Yeah, I bet it sucked. I'm gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.
__Howard How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.
__Bernadette Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna take a bath, and you're gonna do the dishes.
__Howard That's it? No compassion?
__Bernadette Aw, poor Howie. We good? I'm gonna take a bath.
__Howard Bernie…
__Bernadette God, what is going on with you?
__Howard I'm sharing my pain.
__Bernadette And I'm not buying it. Try again.
__Howard I'm learning to be a man in a culture where it's increasingly difficult to know how?
__Bermadette Strike two.
__Howard I'm copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.
__Bernadette Howard.
__Howard I know. It was dumb, I shouldn't have done it. And it's making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don't you take a bath? I'll do the dishes.
__Stuart That's it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.
__Raj Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!
__Stuart That's right, ladies. For all you know, I'm confident and fun to be around.
__Raj Oh, cool, it tells you when someone's reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that's not her weight.
__Raj What? Another one. You know, it, it's weird. When they're reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?
__Stuart Well, they're not running away screaming, so, no.
__Sheldon Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That's strange, since peanut butter wasn't introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.
__Amy You're trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
__Sheldon That's silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.
__Amy Sheldon, we're in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don't need to seek revenge.
__Sheldon Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.
__Amy Well, that's not how we're going to do it.
__Sheldon Fine. I'm mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.
__Amy I shouldn't have said it. I'm sorry.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Amy Do you feel better?
__Sheldon Yes. But not as good as I'm going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He's a cat. He doesn't have a job.
__Penny Oh, just a little treat. I know you've been feeling really bad about your mom lately.
__Leonard Oh, oh, I have. So bad.
__Penny And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.
__Leonard Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.
__Mrs Hofstadter Hello, Leonard.
__Leonard Mom?
__Mrs Hofstadter I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.
__Leonard I… uh…
__Penny Bernadette told me everything. Now you don't get the left or the right.
__Mrs Hofstadter Let's discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.
__Mrs Hofstadter When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.
__Leonard I didn't dream that?
__Mrs Hofstadter How did that make you feel?
__Leonard Penny, come back. I'm sad for real now.
__Stuart Combined?
__Raj Yes.
__Stuart Zero.
__Raj Dude, this is, this is brutal.
__Stuart I don't think I've ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.
__Raj This is the worst. If we're gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.
__Stuart And make them look us in the eye.
__Raj Yeah, anything is better than this.
__Girl Not interested.
__Raj I was wrong. This is worse.
__Sheldon That's true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
__Raj Like a hero.
__All Yeah!
__Leonard Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn't even get that done.
__All Aw!
__Sheldon Oh, no, I got bored with that. I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.
__Penny How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
__Sheldon If you do that, I'll scream.
__Amy Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.
__Sheldon That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one.
__Amy I've been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn't that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool.
__Sheldon You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he's terrible at it, I always win.
__Amy So, you're okay with this?
__Sheldon Well, why wouldn't I be?
__Amy Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there's the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.
__Sheldon My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?
__Amy Sheldon, don't defecate where you eat means don't have a romantic relationship in the workplace.
__Sheldon Really?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That's why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.
__Amy I'm relieved that you don't have a problem with us working together.
__Sheldon Not as relieved as I'm about to be. It's a brave new world, little lady.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Why not? Hairy Fairy.
__Raj I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work.
__Leonard Your father's a gynaecologist.
__Raj I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.
__Howard Would you please tell him this isn't a good idea?
__Leonard No, no, I think it'll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.
__Sheldon That's a Raging Ogre.
__Leonard Yeah, I know.
__Howard I'm just saying, I'd never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you're supposed to hang out with them after work, too?
__Raj Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.
__Howard Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.
__Sheldon Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won't be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we'll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.
__Leonard Please let me be there when you tell her that.
__Sheldon Why? So you can see the look on Amy's face when she hears my top-notch idea?
__Leonard Please, oh, please, just let me be there.
__Amy I'm leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.
__Bernadette If they're anything like humans, the answer's yes.
__Amy Wait, you've, you've done this experiment on humans?
__Bernadette You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical.
__Penny You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That's right, my phone is just as smart as you guys.
__Sheldon Amy, Bernadette, Penny.  Amy, Bernadette, Penny.  Amy, Bernadette, Penny.
__Bernadette He's never gonna stop doing that, is he?
__Amy I don't mind. I'm hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
__Sheldon Hi. Um, I've reconsidered. Uh, you can't work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening.
__Amy Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque.
__Sheldon Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good.
__Penny Sheldon, I don't understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.
__Sheldon Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.
__Bernadette He said what?
__Sheldon Now, don't be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious.
__Bernadette Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?
__Amy No, we're not good here. I am working on this project.
__Penny Yeah, and you can't tell her what she can and cannot do.
__Sheldon Last week, you told Leonard he couldn't wear his Wookie jacket out in public.
__Penny That's different. I'm not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
__Amy Sheldon, you don't have to worry about me bothering you. I'll be in a different building. And we don't even have to have lunch together.
__Sheldon Really?
__Amy Yes. Before all things, I'm a scientist. I'm just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.
__Sheldon Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won't be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
__Amy More and more sure.
__Sheldon Well, then, you have my permission.
__Amy I didn't ask for your permission.
__Sheldon Too late. No backsies.
__Howard No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there'd be too much of me for you, not the other way around.
__Sheldon Howard, if you're going to lie to your wife, don't start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That's a dead giveaway.
__Bernadette Well?
__Howard Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it's true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we'd get sick of each other.
__Sheldon Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.
__Howard For the love of God, why?
__Raj His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
__Howard It's nothing in particular. I…
__Bernadette Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?
__Howard My arm is feeling numb.
__Leonard Nailed it.
__Bernadette That's the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus.
__Howard My point is, I'm sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long.
__Bernadette Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
__Howard Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?
__Bernadette Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
__Howard Bernie…
__Sheldon If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good.
__Raj It wasn't a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.
__Howard Please, stop talking.
__Raj As you wish.
__Howard I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would've happened if I hadn't tried to help you.
__Sheldon Uh, it also wouldn't have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.
__Amy Gentlemen.
__Raj Amy.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard That was kind of icy. You two okay?
__Sheldon Oh, we're fine. As Howard advised, she's merely respecting our professional boundaries.
__Leonard Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj's hair.
__Sheldon Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don't worry, little moth. The flame will come to you.
__Raj Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn't call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?
__Howard I don't know. Sounds kind of heavy.
__Amy And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.
__Sheldon Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?
__Amy Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?
__Sheldon Oh, please, I'm your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That's right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon It's a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here's a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?
__Sheldon Dr. Fowler?
__Amy What do you want, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Well, I'm done with work, so… ugh!
__Amy Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?
__Sheldon Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?
__Amy Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
__Sheldon So, goofing off. As I was saying, I'm done with work and Leonard's not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I'll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.
__Amy I can't leave now, Sheldon. I'm very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor.
__Sheldon What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.
__Amy You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup.
__Sheldon Aw. Embarrassed you?
__Amy You know what? I don't have time for this. Find another way home.
__Sheldon I'm starting to get the sense that you're angry with me.
__Amy Really? What tipped you off?
__Sheldon Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language…
__Amy Get out.
__Sheldon Well, now, that.
__Amy Image number six, woman giving birth.
__Sheldon Bleugh!
__Sheldon Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop.
__Penny Oh, no.
__Sheldon Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?
__Leonard I did not.
__Sheldon Well, I do now. They're a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you're hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk.
__Penny Why'd you get that? You hate lamb.
__Sheldon I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem.
__Leonard I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.
__Sheldon Yeah, I thought so, too, but she's acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law's witch doctor practice.
__Penny Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?
__Sheldon Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon But you didn't even hear the details.
__Sheldon But you don't even know…
__Leonard Doesn't matter.
__Sheldon But, now, but in my defence…
__Leonard Doesn't matter.
__Sheldon You're not listening to my side of it.
__Penny Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?
__Sheldon Well…
__Penny Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.
__Raj You want a TUMS?
__Howard You got the tropical fruit kind?
__Raj No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy.
__Howard Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk.  I'll get it.
__Raj Thanks.
__Bernadette Hi.
__Howard Oh, hi.
__Bernadette I may have overreacted.
__Howard Yeah, well, I didn't handle it so great, either.
__Bernadette It's just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
__Howard That's not true.
__Bernadette It's not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn't want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings.
__Howard Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I'm so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority.
__Bernadette Why tomorrow?
__Howard Well, we're real close to finishing off the new Batman game.
__Raj It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her.
__Howard Should I go after you?
__Bernadette No!
__Amy Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?
__Sheldon I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Well, I cannot give this stuff away.
__Sheldon Amy, this isn't easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you're in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.
__Amy Sheldon, you're not a weirdo.
__Sheldon I wasn't speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there's no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour.
__Amy What's your point?
__Sheldon My point is, we're a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all.
__Amy I like you, too.
__Sheldon Well, I should hope so. I don't see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that's the kind of thing that makes people think you're weird. Poor kid. She just doesn't see it.
__Amy Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I'm just going to ignore him.
__Penny All right, don't worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.
__Howard Pull.
__All Yeah!
__Sheldon Can't talk. In the zone.
__Penny Do you know what he's doing?
__Amy Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who's allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can't believe I didn't make the cut.
__Penny Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food's ready.
__Leonard No, no, what are you doing? He's both happy and quiet. It's like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.
__Howard Sorry we're so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.
__Bernadette Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
__Raj Why is that great news?
__Bernadette In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo' infections, mo' money.
__Howard Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.
__Bernadette Oh, calm down. If I had it, I'd be dead already.
__Howard Guys, listen up.
__Sheldon Can't listen, zone. Also don't care.
__Howard Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.
__Sheldon Really don't care.
__Howard I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.
__Penny Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?
__Howard Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.
__Howard Look, she's gonna be back any second, so here's the deal. I'm writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.
__Leonard Aw.
__Amy Oh, I love that.
__Raj That is so beautiful.
__Howard Sheldon?
__Sheldon When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?
__ Credits sequence
__Penny Yeah. Hey, how come you've never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?
__Leonard Well, for starters, you've broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?
__Sheldon Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.
__Leonard And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you've done for me?
__Penny I can name tons.
__Leonard Sex doesn't count.
__Penny I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.
__Leonard It's fine. And also not true.
__Penny Okay, just you wait and see. I'm gonna romance your freakin' ass off.
__Penny Sheldon?
__Sheldon Zone.
__Leonard He'll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
__Sheldon Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.
__Leonard Nope, it was better before.
__Sheldon Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it's beautiful. It's not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.
__Leonard Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?
__Sheldon Did I? Well, that can't be right. No one's ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…
__Leonard Yeah, definitely better before.
__Leonard If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you've never seen me play the cello.
__Howard Great. Will you play the ukulele?
__Raj Of course. I'd be happy to shred it on my ax.
__Howard Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.
__Raj Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.
__Sheldon Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don't care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks.
__Howard Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.
__Raj Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.
__Sheldon Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.
__Leonard Sheldon, that's incredible.
__Sheldon Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I'm pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.
__Howard So, what happens next?
__Sheldon Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don't worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I've always been.
__Leonard Good to know.
__Sheldon Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.
__Raj You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.
__Penny Okay, good, 'cause I've been really struggling with this.
__Raj As I'm sure you're aware, the quickest way to a man's heart is through his…
__Penny Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn't count.
__Raj Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can't use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man's heart is through his stomach.
__Penny I don't know if I want to cook for him. He's kind of a picky eater. I mean, it's too salty, it's too dry, it's too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?
__Penny Okay, that's just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze's head.
__Raj Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.
__Penny That's from Say Anything.
__Raj Look, I'm a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.
__Raj Well, you've probably never had to do this stuff 'cause you're young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.
__Penny Yeah, I'm trying to be sad about that. I can't.
__Amy I don't think the Smithsonian's gonna want your marker.
__Sheldon And that's why you're not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who's getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I'll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.
__Amy Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.
__Sheldon Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.
__Sheldon This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
__Amy And what?
__Sheldon No. No, no, no, no.
__Amy What's wrong?
__Sheldon I've made a horrible mistake.
__Amy What are you talking about?
__Sheldon This table, it's in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?
__Amy That Americans can't handle the metric system?
__Sheldon Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.
__Amy But the Chinese team found the element.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, they shouldn't have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn't know about.
__Amy So you just got lucky?
__Sheldon Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.
__Amy You and me both, brother. It doesn't matter. The element was found because of you, and that's groundbreaking.
__Sheldon What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I'm not a genius, I'm a fraud.
__Amy You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we're forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.
__Sheldon Oh, great. Now I'm worse than a fraud. I'm practically a biologist.
__Sheldon There's nothing happy about it. I'm being given credit that I don't deserve.
__Leonard Oh, people get things they don't deserve all the time. Look at me with you.
__Sheldon No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I've got to find a way to stop this thing.
__Leonard Buddy, I don't think you can. I mean, once it's out there, it's out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.
__Sheldon You know, frankly, I'd prefer a sex tape.
__Leonard You don't know what a sex tape is, do you?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard We'll be there.
__Raj Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.
__Howard E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.
__Raj Come on, come on, you haven't even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.
__Leonard I will not.
__Raj Oh, please?
__Howard No, I want this to be romantic.
__Raj It will be. I don't call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I'm referring to you.
__Voice There he is.
__Sheldon Stop it. Stop celebrating me.
__Voice Woo!
__Sheldon And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You're fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn't the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.
__Raj Wait, I don't understand. They didn't find the element?
__Sheldon Oh, no, they found the element.  No, no, stop it. I don't need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?
__Leonard Invite them to live with us.
__Leonard Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
__Penny Okay, you know what's not romantic? Rubbing it in someone's face.
__Leonard Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn't count.
__Howard I'm getting worried about Bernadette. I'm gonna call and check on her.
__Sheldon The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
__Raj Oh, that's a big deal.
__Sheldon I know. When will this nightmare end?
__Leonard Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We're really proud of you.
__Amy I'm not.
__Sheldon You're not?
__Amy Sheldon, I've been thinking about it, and you're right. You don't deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you.
__Penny Damn it, everyone's better at this than me.
__Howard Guys, there was an accident at Bernie's lab.
__Leonard Oh, my God, is she okay?
__Howard Yeah, but she's at the hospital in quarantine.
__Penny What?
__Amy Poor Bernadette.
__Leonard Oh, no.
__Sheldon I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.
__Bernadette Well, let's just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips.
__Howard You're sure you're okay?
__Bernadette Yeah, it's just a precaution. If there was a problem, I'd be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.
__Howard Oh, don't worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.
__Bernadette What's all this?
__Howard Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.
__Bernadette Howie.
__Amy Sheldon, get over here.
__Sheldon She might be contagious. Don't you think I'm having a rough enough day?
__Amy Sheldon.
__Howard If I didn't have you, life would be blue, I'd be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.
__Sheldon Is it me, or does she not look so good?
__Amy Shh.
__Howard A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I'd be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I'd be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I'd be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I'd be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I'd probably still live with my mom.
__All And he'd probably still live with his mom.
__Howard Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You're like uranium-235 and I'm uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn't have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.
__Howard If I didn't have you life would be dreary, I'd be string theory without any string. I'd be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I'd be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I'd speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam.
__All And he'd definitely still live with his mom.
__Howard Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You're my best friend and my lover. We're like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can't have one without the other. I couldn't have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.
__All Oh, we couldn't have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.
__Bernadette Howie, that was amazing. Look, I'm shaking.
__Sheldon She's sick, I knew it. Bye.
__Penny I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, 'cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.
__Leonard Stop it, you're gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.
__Penny Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you'll see why.
__Leonard Oh, rose petals.
__Penny Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.
__Leonard You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.
__Penny Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.
__Leonard Oh, wow.
__Penny It's a first edition of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.
__Leonard This is great. It, thank you, it's, so much.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Nothing. I love it.
__Penny No. Something's going on. What's wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.
__Leonard It's true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.
__Penny Oh, my God, I am the worst.
__Leonard No, no, it's okay. It's really thoughtful.
__Penny No, it's not. I mean, what's thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here's the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here's the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.
__Leonard I can't believe you saved all this stuff.
__Penny Of course I did. It's you.
__Leonard Come here.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard Is that a pregnancy test?
__Penny Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn't save them all.
__Amy Me? What did I do?
__Sheldon You distract me. I've been distracted since the moment I met you.
__Amy Sorry.
__Sheldon Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.
__Amy Oh, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Sheldon (not in Amy's daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory): Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?
__Amy Can't talk, in the zone.
__Leonard That's because you've never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
__Sheldon Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can't wait until I get a rash.
__Leonard Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.
__Sheldon Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?
__Leonard Oh, yeah.
__Sheldon Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn't moderately famous 30 years ago. Let's go say hello.
__Leonard Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.
__Sheldon I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.
__Leonard He thinks there's a difference.
__Sheldon Arthur? Arthur, it's me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.
__Arthur Trust me, I, I remember.
__Arthur Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?
__Amy Yes, and I've heard so much about you. Hey look, we're wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.
__Arthur Oh, okay, I get it now.
__Leonard Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.
__Arthur Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?
__Leonard No, she's not.
__Sheldon So, what prescription are you getting filled?
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon No. Wait, I want to guess. Don't tell me.
__Arthur I wasn't going to tell you.
__Amy Sheldon, come on.
__Sheldon No, no, no. I'm really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?
__Arthur Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess.
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.
__Sheldon But I'm hanging out with my friend, and we're having fun. Look how happy he is.
__ Credits sequence.
__ The cafeteria.
__ Bernie's having a girls' night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?
__Raj Actually, I'm busy.
__Howard Doing what?
__Raj There's a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…
__Howard You're going to girls' night.
__Raj Yeah.
__Howard You know they're making jewellery right?
__Raj You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
__Leonard What's up?
__Howard Not his testosterone levels.
__Raj Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
__Howard How is that possible?
__Leonard Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.
__Sheldon Goody. What's it say?
__Leonard He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I'd take a look at it.
__Sheldon That's strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard's email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can't believe he picked you over me.
__Howard You don't want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn't done any real science in decades.
__Raj Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.
__Sheldon Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
__Howard It's true, you'd rust.
__Amy Is it really worth getting upset about?
__Sheldon Yeah, they say don't meet your heroes. Don't peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you'll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.
__Amy Come on, he's a retired kids show host.
__Sheldon That's even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
__Sheldon Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.
__Amy Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.
__Sheldon That's kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I've mastered the big three. There's the coy smile. There's the friendly chuckle. There's the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one's tricky, I'm still working on it.
__Amy From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…
__Sheldon What?
__Amy Doesn't matter.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, it won't hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying. I'm annoying. I'm annoying. I'm annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can't stand it when I'm right.
__Raj Penny, how's it going over there?
__Penny Good, I'm just having little trouble with the glue.
__Amy How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?
__Penny Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.
__Howard Hello, everyone.
__Raj Okay, let me have it. Let's hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.
__Howard Nope. Bernadette told me it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.
__Raj Thank you.
__Howard So I won't be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.
__Bernadette Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I'm making.
__Howard Oh, that's actually pretty nice.
__Amy I'm making a bracelet.
__Penny Yeah, I'm just making a mess.
__Howard You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You'd be able to make much cooler stuff.
__Raj Oh, I think we're doing just fine, thank you.
__Amy Actually, I'd kind of like to try that.
__Bernadette Me, too.
__Howard Be right back.
__Penny When did I have pistachios?
__Arthur Sheldon, what are you doing here?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, did I wake you?
__Arthur Of course you woke me, it's seven thirty.
__Arthur What do you want, Sheldon?
__Sheldon It's been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.
__Arthur She sounds like a keeper.
__Sheldon Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.
__Arthur All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.
__Sheldon No, no, now that we've cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.
__Arthur Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.
__Sheldon Well, then, I'll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it's promising and he's going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you're a washed-up has-been. Or dead.
__Arthur I should be so lucky.
__Sheldon So, uh, what do you say?
__Arthur You know, if it's all the same with you, I, I think I'll, I'll stick with Leonard.
__Sheldon It's because I'm annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I'm annoying.
__Arthur Good night.
__Sheldon Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I'm annoying. Say it. Say it. I'm annoying. Say it.
__Arthur You're annoying.
__Sheldon Well, that really hurt.
__Arthur If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.
__Leonard I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I'm just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it's really interesting.
__Sheldon Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you're both here.
__Leonard Why is it odd?
__Sheldon Because as it just so happens, I'm also spending the day with a beloved children's television science personality. Isn't that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.
__Bill Nye Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It's an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.
__Arthur That's what I told my lawyers.
__Leonard Mr. Nye, hello. I'm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.
__Sheldon No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let's go.
__Bill What are you guys working on?
__Leonard Oh, uh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.
__Bill Oh, that's interesting.
__Arthur Haven't you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.
__Amy Wow, Penny, good job.
__Penny Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I'm getting a drink.
__Amy What are you working on?
__Raj Ah, I'm making a necklace for my mom.
__Amy That's sweet.
__Raj Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.
__Penny What's going on with them?
__Raj They're just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it's because the sound of my mom's voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
__Bernadette Hi.
__Penny Hey, guys.
__Amy Hello.
__Howard Look who's here to put the Jew in jewellery night.
__Bernadette Oh, sure, so it's fine when you say it.
__Howard Sorry we're late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
__Raj I didn't know you were coming again.
__Howard Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.
__Penny It was not funny.
__Amy So, what tools did you bring?
__Howard Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here's some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.
__Penny Ooh, that looks like fun.
__Bernadette Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
__Howard Okay, who's up first?
__Amy Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?
__Raj No, thanks.
__Howard I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn't have a neck. She's just chins and fat and feet.
__Arthur This is so exciting, I, I feel like I'm 75 again.
__Leonard Oh, God.
__Arthur What, what is it?
__Leonard Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
__Arthur Can, can I ask you a question?
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Arthur Why do you put up with Sheldon?
__Leonard Oh, uh, you know, because we're friends.
__Arthur Why?
__Leonard Wow, you ask really hard questions.
__Arthur Yeah.
__Leonard Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he's not doing it on purpose. It's just how he is. But he's also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.
__Arthur You, you know you're describing a dog.
__Leonard He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…
__Arthur Yeah, they, they hate that.
__Leonard You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he's a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.
__Arthur Why, why is that?
__Leonard Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.
__Arthur Another photo from Sheldon?
__Leonard No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.
__Penny Oh, that's amazing,
__Howard Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring? That came right off my mom's back.
__Raj My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
__Raj I'll tell you where it's coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls' night and now you're here ruining it for everyone.
__Penny Raj, cool it, he's gonna make us hair diamonds.
__Howard How am I ruining anything? I'm just trying to help you make better jewellery.
__Raj But this isn't about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
__Howard Since when can't you open up with me?
__Raj There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won't make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.
__Howard Buddy, I was just joking around.
__Howard You're right. I didn't realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.
__Raj Thank you. It wasn't easy.
__Amy They're gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.
__Arthur Hi, Sheldon.
__Sheldon I'm surprised to see you here.
__Arthur Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.
__Sheldon I'll get Leonard.
__Arthur No, no, no, I'm, I'm here, I'm here to see you.
__Sheldon If you're hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can't help you. I've been informed that he's now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.
__Arthur No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to get your opinion about my, my paper.
__Sheldon Thank you. It would be an honour.
__Arthur Oh. Uh, great.
__Sheldon Actually, I don't need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.
__Arthur And, what did you think?
__Sheldon Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.
__Arthur Mmm. Thank you.
__Arthur Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.
__Sheldon Can I invite you in for tea?
__Arthur Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.
__Penny Hey, Arthur. How are you?
__Arthur Well, I guess one cup wouldn't hurt.
__Raj Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.
__Howard You didn't have to do that.
__Raj Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It's a lightsabre belt buckle.
__Howard Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.
__Raj Oh gets better.
__Howard Wow.
__Raj And that's not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.
__Leonard He can't help it. He can't. He really can't.
__Sheldon Oh, wait here. I'll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house. As long as I'm not within 500 feet of it.
__Arthur So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?
__Penny Sorry, they're both married.
__Arthur Good.
__Penny Mmm.
__Arthur Hap, hap, happily?
__Leonard Sure.
__Penny You've had this dart board since I've known you, but I've never seen you play.
__Penny What window?
__Leonard That one over there.
__Sheldon Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?
__Leonard Skee-Ball tickets?
__Sheldon Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.
__Leonard Uh, if I still have them, they're probably in the junk box.
__Penny Ooh, what are you gonna get?
__Sheldon None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.
__Leonard Yup, oh, here you go.
__Sheldon Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.
__Leonard Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.
__Penny Aw, did she hate you?
__Leonard Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.
__Sheldon I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?
__Leonard Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they're not in there.
__Sheldon Well, you barely looked. Let me see.
__Leonard No, no, no, I, I looked, and there's, there's, there's no more tickets.
__Sheldon Leonard, let me look in the box.
__Leonard Okay, okay. I'm gonna show you what's in the box. But just promise not to flip out.
__Sheldon Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It's a spider.
__Penny No, if it was a spider, Lenny would've flipped out.
__Leonard Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it's been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?
__Sheldon That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?
__Sheldon Okay.
__Leonard I mean it, I'm going to.
__Sheldon I believe you.
__Leonard And you're going to stay calm?
__Sheldon I said I would.
__Leonard How about that? Sheldon's being reasonable.
__Penny Yeah, it's freaking me out. I'm gonna go.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Okay, first, talking to you while you're on the toilet isn't exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It's, it's like, a, an itch in my brain I can't scratch.
__Leonard When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?
__Sheldon You wouldn't make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.
__Leonard Well, I don't know how to do that.
__Leonard That's stupid. Why?
__Sheldon You say it's itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.
__Leonard I'm telling you, try the hanger.
__Sheldon Put it on. Let's share the experience.
__Leonard You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I'm gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.
__Sheldon Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.
__Sheldon How those nipples feeling, chief?
__Penny Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.
__Amy At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.
__Bernadette Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.
__Penny I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only 'cause my manager saw me put it there.
__Amy Oh, my gosh. That's the girl that broke Rajesh's heart.
__Bernadette That's Lucy?
__Penny I don't know why but I always pictured her as Indian.
__Penny I'm gonna go talk to her.
__Bernadette Why? What are you gonna say?
__Penny I'm not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who's racist now?
__Bernadette You because you just called him your Indian friend.
__Penny Yeah, well, you're short.
__Amy We're never getting our drinks.
__Bernadette No, but we knew that.
__Penny Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?
__Lucy Oh, water would be great.
__Penny Okay. Um, you're Lucy, right? I'm a friend of Raj Koothrappali's. Actually Amy recognized you.
__Lucy Wow. How's he doing?
__Penny Oh, you know, he's good.
__Lucy Great.
__Penny Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?
__Lucy Oh, I don't know. I guess I thought it would be easier.
__Penny Yeah, I get that. I'll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn't make it easier for him.
__Lucy Any chance I can get a different waitress?
__Penny I'm sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?
__Lucy I don't know your e-mail.
__Penny You know what the worst part is? You're sitting here, perfectly happy and he's at home, a blubbering mess.
__Lucy Oh, I thought you said he was okay.
__Penny Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?
__Leonard No.
__Raj Not even to sleep?
__Leonard No.
__Howard So, you're just an idiot?
__Leonard It's called proving a point.
__Howard Is the point that you're an idiot?
__Raj So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?
__Leonard Monday morning I'll go downtown, look up the owner's information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!
__Howard And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.
__Raj I don't get it.
__Howard You didn't have Smokey the Bear in India?
__Raj No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.
__Howard You had to be taught not to play with cobras?
__Raj You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
__Bernadette We did, you never brought it.
__Penny Oh, that's right. Nachos and a turkey club.
__Amy Not even close.
__Penny Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.
__Amy You want to say sorry.
__Bernadette So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?
__Penny What do you mean how? What's the big deal?
__Amy You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.
__Bernadette Then you made her cry and leave.
__Penny Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.
__Sheldon I'm thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
__Howard That's a pretty cool idea.
__Sheldon Yeah. It's great you're here. I'd love to get an engineer's opinion.
__Howard Sure.
__Sheldon This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?
__Leonard Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I'd just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn't use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.
__Leonard Or it's resolved.
__Sheldon Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.
__Howard I believe this is yours.
__Howard You can't let her know you're hurting. You know, the key is confidence.
__Raj Why is the key always confidence? How come it's never love handles and flop sweat?
__Bernadette If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?
__Howard Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he'd still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.
__Raj He's right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.
__Bernadette Well, if you're sure you want to do this, it's only coffee, just relax and see what happens.
__Raj Well, can I say she looks nice?
__Bernadette Sure.
__Raj Can I tell her I miss her?
__Bernadette Maybe, if she asks.
__Raj Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?
__Bernadette I'd save that for the second date.
__Raj Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.
__Leonard Oh, I'm just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon's stupid face when he sees that I didn't let this get to me.
__Penny Sheldon's not here. Why don't you take the sweater off?
__Leonard There's a principle at stake.
__Penny Which is?
__Leonard Oh, I don't know. Who cares? Look at me.
__Penny Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won't tell.
__Leonard No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.
__Penny Sweetie, every night you don't kill him in his sleep, he wins.
__Leonard No, it's, it's almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send 'em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.
__Penny Smile.
__Leonard What is that? What is that for?
__Penny So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.
__Sheldon I don't know why that surprises you. I'm a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
__Amy Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you're employing?
__Sheldon The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?
__Amy I'm gonna go with sad. So what's the story with you and this DVD?
__Sheldon There's nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don't Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.
__Amy Seriously?
__Sheldon Please. Ha-ha, Oh.
__Raj Hello. Oh, it's so good to see you.
__Lucy You, too.
__Raj Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?
__Lucy I'm pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail.
__Raj Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.
__Lucy Okay.
__Raj I'm so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.
__Lucy Oh, uh, I'm kind of seeing someone.
__Raj I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it's not me, right?
__Penny There's a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.
__Amy I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?
__Sheldon There's probably a deep reason. Which I'd be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
__Leonard Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.
__Sheldon Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?
__Leonard Oh, oh, no, no. It's because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn't a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I'm not Armenian, so it probably won't work. This is over, right?
__Sheldon Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.
__Leonard Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.
__Sheldon You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.
__Leonard Why isn't this bothering you? Isn't your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn't this making you crazy?
__Sheldon Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.
__Leonard Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!
__Amy Sheldon, that was diabolical.
__Girl Well, I don't.
__Raj I don't believe you, you're lying to me.
__Raj Oh, it's okay. I have no morals and I'm desperately lonely. I'll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.
__Penny Yes, it is.
__Sheldon Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn't do it.
__Raj It's horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They're sacred.
__Penny Oh, stop it. I've seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.
__Raj Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.
__Penny Look, I'm telling you I've done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.
__Leonard Were you drunk?
__Penny I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
__Leonard I think you're the one who fell over.
__Penny That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
__Howard Hey.
__Penny Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
__Howard Mmm. I'm gonna say not. That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she's snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.
__Sheldon Mmm. You know, I've been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I'd love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.
__Howard Come on, it'll be fun.
__Penny Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.
__Howard Please? Bernadette's bringing her dad 'cause her mom's out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.
__Sheldon Oh, since you put it that way, I'd love to go, but that sounds even more awful.
__Leonard It'd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
__Sheldon Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?
__Leonard I want to go.
__Penny Yeah, me, too.
__Raj I'm in.
__Howard Sheldon.
__Sheldon Ugh, fine, I'll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it's on you.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
__Amy Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.
__Leonard You did?
__Penny Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.
__Leonard Wait, you went to a chapel?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Why?
__Penny We had one of those silly fake weddings.
__Leonard Penny, you know those are real, right?
__Penny No, they're not.
__Leonard Yeah, they are.
__Penny No, they're not.
__Leonard Yeah, they are.
__Sheldon He's right.
__Amy They're real.
__Penny But it didn't seem real.
__Sheldon Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?
__Mike Hi, honey.
__Bernadette Oh, you brought beer for everybody.
__Mike Uh, okay, yeah, it's for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.
__Bernadette You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard, the medicine's not working.
__Howard You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach.  Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.
__Mike Thanks. What's wrong with your mom?
__Howard Oh, her gout's flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.
__Mrs Wolowitz How can one little toe hurt so bad?
__Howard Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.
__Bernadette I guess we're gonna have to do all the cooking.
__Howard I have a better idea.
__Bernadette If you think you're gonna make me do all this by myself, you're crazy.
__Howard I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.
__Bernadette Oh, well, that's a great idea.
__Sheldon Yes. Like we're on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
__Amy Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate. You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.
__Sheldon Yes, Miss Amy.
__Leonard I can't believe you're married to that idiot.
__Penny Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.
__Leonard Well, a goof or not, you're actually married. You need to get this taken care of.
__Penny I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
__Sheldon Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard's proposed, he's gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that's just off the top of my head.
__Penny So how do I undo this?
__Leonard I'm hoping you can get an annulment. It's just like it never happened.
__Penny Great, well, what do I have to do?
__Amy It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
__Sheldon Hah!Penny? Next.
__Amy Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?
__Penny Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
__Amy Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.
__Raj Ah, no problem. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?
__Howard Um, I don't know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.
__Bernadette I'll help Raj in here. Why don't you go keep my dad company?
__Howard He doesn't want me in there. I'm the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
__Bernadette Don't be silly, he loves you.
__Howard Does he?
__Bernadette Okay, he cares about you a lot.
__Howard Really?
__Howard So your wife's in Arizona with the grandkids?
__Mike Uh-huh.
__Howard You know, my mom's been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she's so fat. I'll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.
__Amy Happy Thanksgiving.
__Sheldon It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…
__Amy Sheldon.
__Penny Here. Thank you for having us.
__Howard What's with you?
__Leonard Oh, she's mad at me because she just found out she's married to Zack.
__Howard Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That's hysterical.
__Penny I can't believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.
__Raj Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?
__Amy Uh, sure.
__Raj Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you're on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That's right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I'll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.
__Amy Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?
__Together What?
__Mike A little in college. You?
__Howard No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.
__Leonard Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I'll print them when we get home.
__Penny Fine.
__Leonard And we can just put this whole thing behind us.
__Penny Are you done?
__Leonard What?
__Penny Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we're gonna talk about the rest of the day?
__Leonard Why are you mad at me? You're the one that did the stupid thing. I'm just trying to fix it.
__Penny Ugh, I need some air.
__Leonard Wuh, Penny.
__Sheldon I don't know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.
__Mike Listen to Stretch.
__Leonard How am I the bad guy? She's the one who married someone else. I'm the victim.
__Howard Sounds like Zack's the victim. You're sleeping with his wife.
__Mike I've kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?
__Leonard Sure.
__Mike I'm trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?
__Sheldon They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
__Mike How the hell do you know that?
__Penny Well, you'll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he's willing to sign the court papers. He's on his way here now.
__Leonard Wait, you invited him here?
__Penny Yeah.
__Mike I'm getting ready to weigh in again.
__Leonard Come on.
__Mike What do you think they ought to do now?
__Sheldon I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.
__Howard Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.
__Mrs Wolowitz Did someone say blintz?
__Penny Because you wouldn't shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…
__Raj Hey, guys, I'm trying to cook in here.
__Penny Oh, sorry. We'll keep it down.
__Raj No, no, speak up. I'm about to use the blender, and I don't want to miss anything.
__Leonard Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.
__Bernadette What?
__Amy Ooh!
__Raj My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.
__Howard That's why I sit.
__Mike Yeah, that's why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?
__Sheldon 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
__Mike I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.
__Sheldon So was my dad. And then he did.
__Howard Anyone need a beer?
__Mike Yeah.
__Howard Thank God.
__Mike So, does your dad still live in Texas?
__Sheldon No. He died when I was 14.
__Mike I'm sorry to hear that.
__Sheldon So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
__Howard Here you go.
__Mike Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.
__Sheldon No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.
__Mike Well, you're having one with me.
__Sheldon All right.
__Mike To your dad.
__Howard I never had a beer with my dad, either.
__Sheldon Do you mind? We're having a moment here.
__Raj Wonder what she saw in that guy.
__Bernadette I don't know. He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.
__Amy Broad shoulders, good hair.
__Raj Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
__Bernadette How's it going out there?
__Howard Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
__Amy I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he's not looking.
__Howard They're drinking beer and watching football.
__Bernadette So why don't you do that with them?
__Howard They don't want me.
__Bernadette What do you mean?
__Howard Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn't alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…
__Amy Zack's here!
__Raj Stir the gravy.
__Bernadette Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I'll be back in like five, ten minutes.
__Zack It's all right. I didn't have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we're married, and Thanksgiving's a time to be with family.
__Penny Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?
__Leonard Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we'll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.
__Penny Okay.
__Zack I don't know if I want to sign it.
__Raj, Bernadette and Amy Ooh.
__Leonard Why won't you sign it?
__Penny We don't have any kids.
__Zack Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn't know we were married until this morning.
__Penny Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.
__Zack Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.
__Leonard You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
__Penny Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you're right there to make me feel even worse about it.
__Leonard That is not true.
__Penny Yeah, we could've waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.
__Leonard You're the one who invited him here.
__Penny Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you're throwing in my face.
__Zack Not cool, bro. I'm starting to think you're not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.
__Leonard Yeah, well, she's not gonna be your wife for long.
__Zack Oh, no. Are you dying?
__Penny I'm about to. Sign the paper.
__Zack Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let's eat.
__Mike That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.
__Mrs Wolowitz Did somebody say pie?
__Mike I don't know what's scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.
__Sheldon All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there's the clown that came out of her. I really didn't want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I've had in a long time.
__Mike Me, too.
__Bernadette Hey. Howie says you've been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.
__Sheldon She's so tiny. It's funny when she's mad.
__Amy All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.
__Sheldon Perhaps you're right. I'm sorry for my behaviour. I've had alcohol, and it's caused me to be inappropriate.
__Bernadette It's okay.
__Howard Don't worry about it.
__Amy Thank you.
__Sheldon Ain't she great?
__Mike Mmm.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?
__Amy Yeah, everything was delicious.
__Mike Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?
__Sheldon This is a Jewish house. I don't think they have pigskin.
__Mrs Wolowitz Did someone say pigskin?
__Penny Hey, I'm sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won't be a joke. It'll be for love. Or money.
__Leonard I'm sorry, too.
__Zack Don't be. It's my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.
__Mike I know I'm hard on you, but you're not the worst son-in-law in the world.
__Howard Mike, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
__Mike Well, I'm drunk.
__Sheldon I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
__Sheldon Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn't want to. Uh, big fan of the show.
__Ira So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Ira And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.
__Sheldon Who? Give me their names. I bet it's Wolowitz.
__Ira It's just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It's like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.
__Sheldon Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
__Ira That's interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn't that be unusual? Because you're a physicist.
__Sheldon Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy I know you don't like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, I'm not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.
__Leonard Of course you're not. People love trained monkeys.
__Penny How can you not be happy? You're tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.
__Sheldon Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.
__Sheldon But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
__Penny Mmm, you clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.
__Howard I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.
__Bernadette Come on, it's your friend who's coming to stay here.
__Howard Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he's seen worse.
__Bernadette Howie.
__Howard I promise I'll help out the rest of the week.
__Bernadette The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.
__Bernadette I love Raj, but that's a long time for a house guest.
__Howard I know, but they're tenting his building. He can't find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.
__Bernadette He's bringing Cinnamon?
__Howard For a whole week, the nerve of some people.
__Amy Sheldon, can I come in?
__Sheldon Do you have cookies?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Good. I don't deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?
__Wil Wheaton Hey, Sheldon. It's been a while.
__Sheldon Why are you here?
__Wil Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?
__Sheldon Certainly. Although, right now, I'm having a rough time because there's three people in my room, and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.
__Amy Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.
__Wil Yeah, I know a little something about that.
__Sheldon Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.
__Wil I remember why it's been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.
__Sheldon How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn't relate to that?
__Wil Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.
__Sheldon That just happened to me. Next time you're stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.
__Amy Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.
__Wil Yeah, I'm an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.
__Amy Uh, we're trying to cheer him up, so…
__Sheldon I do see what you're saying. That helps.
__Wil Good.
__Sheldon Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
__Wil Sure.
__Amy Okay.
__Sheldon Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.
__Wil Can I blow the whistle?
__Sheldon You should probably go.
__Raj No, I'm gonna brush Cinnamon's teeth.
__Howard Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.
__Raj And the other half licking my face. That's why I'm brushing her teeth.
__Bernadette Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late. Did you already have dinner?
__Bernadette Aw, that's so sweet.
__Howard Yeah. So what do you feel like making?
__Raj Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I'll cook dinner.
__Bermadette Oh, Raj, you're our guest.
__Raj Don't be silly. Sit. You look like you've had a long day.
__Howard No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.
__Bernadette Thank you, Raj.
__Raj Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.
__Bernadette Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting 'cause I was stuck in traffic.
__Howard Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.
__Raj Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.
__Howard I thought of you the whole time.
__Raj All I'm saying is there's a time to just listen.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__Raj There's also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it's when you're ten.
__Leonard Hey, you're in a good mood.
__Sheldon I'm in a great mood.
__Leonard Well, you're about to be in an even better one. I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.
__Sheldon Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.
__Leonard Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.
__Sheldon Really?
__Leonard Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
__Sheldon So no more interviews?
__Leonard No, it's all over.
__Sheldon I can't believe it.
__Leonard Well, you're welcome.
__Sheldon You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I'm back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I'm sick of Wolowitz, too.
__Leonard I, I don't understand. All you've done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.
__Sheldon By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.
__Leonard Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don't even live near each other.
__Sheldon That's what makes their friendship unlikely,
__Penny Hey, what's with all the yelling?
__Sheldon Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
__Penny Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled,
__Sheldon That's it, I'm down to seven friends.
__Penny He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?
__Sheldon When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.
__Leonard The, the element never existed. I didn't take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.
__Sheldon Don't you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.
__Leonard Will you tell him he's out of his mind.
__Sheldon Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.
__Penny It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.
__Sheldon I have no idea what she's talking about, but we're ganging up on you so I agree.
__Leonard Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don't publish it, it's just a matter of time before someone else does.
__Sheldon No, no, of course you have to publish. That's your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.
__Leonard Fine, I'll publish.
__Sheldon Can you believe this guy?
__Howard How do you know I didn't do them?
__Bernadette Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.
__Raj Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here's your soy peppermint mocha.
__Bernadette Aw, you didn't have to do that.
__Raj Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry about your presentation today. You're gonna be great.
__Howard Yeah, you're gonna knock it out of the park.
__Bernadette What presentation do I have today?
__Howard Just go.
__Raj He loves you.
__Howard What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?
__Raj I'm just being a good house guest.
__Howard No, you're being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?
__Raj Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.
__Howard I don't want coffee.
__Raj That's why I got you hot chocolate.
__Howard Give me that. Just stop showing me up.
__Raj Howard, listen to me. You're a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it's amazing how far you've come given that you're an only child raised by an over-protective mom.
__Howard Um, is this getting weird?
__Raj Hang on.
__Howard So, yes.
__Sheldon I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
__Leonard These things happen all the time, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
__Barry Thew he is. It's my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.
__Leonard Come on, don't give him a hard time.
__Barry I'm sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.
__Leonard It's not a big deal.
__Barry It's a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.
__Leonard Okay, Barry, that's enough.
__Sheldon No, no, no, that's okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn't that right, Bawwy.
__Barry Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That's pwetty hurtful. I, I can't contwol it.
__Sheldon You're right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.
__Barry Of course you do. Because you're the Wetwactor.
__Raj Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You've been looking too skinny lately.
__Bernadette Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?
__Howard What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren't? How's that different?
__Bernadette Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.
__Howard Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.
__Bernadette Oh, really?
__Howard Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get 'em.
__Bernadette Like I don't do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get 'em? You're a grown man, you should know to go get 'em.
__Howard I do know to go get 'em, but sometimes it's nice to have emotional support when I'm going and getting them.
__Raj Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let's just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.
__Bernadette This is stupid. Why are we fighting?
__Howard I don't know. I guess I was just feeling like I'm a lousy husband.
__Bernadette You're not a lousy husband. You're a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
__Howard Are you kidding? You're the best. I know what the problem is. It's him.
__Raj Oh, what did I do?
__Howard You made us feel like we're not trying hard enough.
__Bernadette Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.
__Raj Look, I'm sorry you're upset with me, but I just have to say it's nice to see the two of you on the same page.
__Howard Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.
__Bernadette I back you up all the time.
__Howard That is not… he's doing it again.
__Bernadette What is wrong with you?
__Raj I can't believe they're still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's toothbrush at Howard's. I guess you're sharing with Daddy again.
__Penny Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
__Sheldon What's that animal doing in our apartment?
__Leonard Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.
__Sheldon I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.
__Penny You know, if it makes you feel any better…
__Sheldon It probably won't.
__Penny You're probably right.
__Amy Sheldon, it's a beautiful night. Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?
__Sheldon Oh, everything is just sex with you isn't it?
__Raj Sheldon, I think you might find the support you're looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.
__Amy Thank you, Rajesh.
__Raj And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.
__Amy You should probably go.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Ira It's all right.
__Sheldon Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?
__Ira No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?
__Leonard Well…
__Sheldon I believe I can answer that.
__Leonard He asked me.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Leonard As I was saying…
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon That's right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour's dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn't build because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.
__Ira You know, I'd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it's okay with you.
__Sheldon What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
__Ira Actually, I didn't invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.
__Leonard Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.
__Sheldon Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.
__Penny You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.
__Sheldon You know, I don't just say smart things about science. I also yodel.
__Amy I'll get the vodka.
__Amy Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I'm like a pyramid.
__Penny How you doing over there?
__Leonard Oh, I hope it's just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.
__Penny Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?
__Sheldon Oh, I would, but I'm on my way out.
__Leonard Where?
__Sheldon Texas.
__Amy Right now? Why?
__Leonard Is someone sick?
__Sheldon Yes. My sister's uterus came down with a baby.
__Penny Oh, she's pregnant? That's great. You're gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.
__Sheldon Well, I never told you about my brother's kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family's genitals?
__Sheldon Yes. I'm filling in for her husband who's recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.
__Penny Wow, so, how long will you be gone?
__Sheldon Well, she's due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?
__Amy Can I give you a ride to the airport?
__Sheldon Oh, no, thank you, I don't want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Yeah, which means we don't have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.
__Leonard And I'm happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.
__Penny Ah.
__Raj Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?
__Leonard I know, it's crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people.
__Howard I've never done this before. It's kind of fun.
__Raj Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she'd have a heart attack.
__Bernadette Good idea, I'll take a picture.
__Penny Honey, I'm a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.
__Leonard I love it.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard But it is what you got me last year.
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard And last night.
__Stuart Hello.
__Various Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc
__Stuart Oh, good, I'm glad you guys didn't wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it's, it's seven, but that's fine.
__Amy Oh, it's probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody's here, say hi.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Hey, buddy.
__Raj Hey.
__Howard Howdy.
__Bernadette Hi.
__Stuart Hello.
__Sheldon The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?
__Amy Yeah, kinda.
__Sheldon That's so thoughtful. You guys are the best.
__Penny Hey, how's your sister?
__Sheldon <i>She went into labor an hour ago.
__Amy That's wonderful. So you're at the hospital?
__Sheldon No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn't available.
__Raj You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.
__Sheldon And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.
__Mrs Cooper Shelly, come on. Your sister's fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there's blood everywhere.
__Sheldon Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.
__Raj If you were having Sheldon's baby would you really want him in the room?
__Penny Yeah, if he's in the room when they're making the baby, I'll give you ten dollars.
__Bernadette Hey, I brought over It's a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.
__Amy Oh, I love that movie.
__Raj I've never seen it.
__Stuart Me neither.
__Amy It's great. It's Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart's really depressed and he's gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.
__Stuart Don't need to see it. Living it.
__Bernadette But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he'd never been born.
__Penny Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?
__Leonard What do you think?  What do you think?  What do you think?
__Amy You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren't for him, I don't think any of us would be sitting in this room right now.
__Howard Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I'm in this room.
__Leonard You don't know that. I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up.
__Penny Oh, you weren't joking.
__Leonard No.
__Penny Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.
__ Fantasy sequence in Cheesecake Factory.
__ I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna ask her out.
__Howard I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we're saying things that are never gonna happen.
__Raj Maybe this time he's going to do it.
__Howard Hope you're thirsty, here it comes.
__Leonard Watch me.
__Penny Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?
__Leonard I, uh, ah, um, I…
__Penny A few minutes it is.
__Raj You didn't ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.
__Leonard You guys are making me nervous.
__Howard Fine, then go talk to her on your own.
__Leonard I will. Excuse me.
__Penny Yeah?
__Leonard Hi, uh, um, I'm Leonard?
__Penny Really? You don't sound so sure.
__Leonard No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there's been something I've wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.
__Penny What's that?
__Leonard Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you're not too busy, um, uh, if, if you'd be interested in telling me where the restroom is?
__ End fantasy sequence
__ Come on, I would not have peed my pants.
__Howard She nailed it.
__Raj Sounds about right.
__Leonard But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.
__Bernadette Well…
__ Fantasy sequence in the Cheesecake Factory.
__ Hey, Penny, can I take that table?
__Penny Sure, why?
__Bernadette The one in the turtleneck is cute.
__Raj Open wide, here comes the happy train.
__Howard Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum.
__Raj Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah.
__Bernadette Never mind.
__ End fantasy sequence.
__ Oh, man, that is so us.
__Leonard You know, maybe you and I wouldn't be together, but you wouldn't have done so great yourself.
__Penny Why?
__Leonard Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would've ended up with.
__ Fantasy sequence in Penny's apartment.
__ Hey, babe.
__Penny Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?
__Zack Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.
__ End fantasy sequence.
__ Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn't pee himself.
__Leonard Oh, hold on.
__ Fantasy sequence.
__ Aw, babe, I peed myself.
__Penny Me, too.
__ End fantasy sequence.
__ The end.
__Amy Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?
__Sheldon No, it's not. I've seen things. Lady things.
__Amy Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.
__Sheldon Doesn't matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It's some kind of dirty magic show.
__Mrs Cooper Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.
__Sheldon Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I'm the janitor of my sister's birth canal.
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there's pictures. Aah! Don't open them. Do not open them.
__Penny Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it's like someone sawed a cow in half.
__Raj My father's a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I'm gay.
__Bernadette You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him.
__Amy And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.
__Penny We do?
__ Fantasy sequence in the Laundry Room.
__ Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny Doing laundry?
__Sheldon Of course I'm doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I'm in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.
__Penny Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who's wearing them.
__ End fantasy sequence.
__ Okay, that's enough.
__Leonard Disagree.
__Raj Keep going.
__Howard More.
__ Fantasy sequence.
__ So, what do you think?
__Sheldon A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.
__Penny Please, Sheldon. I need you.
__Sheldon To what?
__Penny To take me.
__Sheldon I'm not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.
__Penny Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.
__Sheldon Penny, for the thousandth time, I'm saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud.
__Penny I think I know how to change your mind.
__ End fantasy sequence.
__ That's enough.
__Raj Ew.
__Stuart I was okay with it.
__Amy How's it going, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Actually, much better.
__Leonard Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?
__Sheldon I don't know. I just got back.
__Amy Where'd you go?
__Sheldon My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.  Excuse me, I'm on the phone. So rude.
__Amy Here's another one. Penny, if it weren't for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.
__Penny Great.
__Raj At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.
__Bernadette Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?
__Howard I lived with her to save money.
__Raj Yeah, you didn't have to buy groceries 'cause you were breast-feeding.
__Bernadette Aw, so I guess if it weren't for me, you'd still be living with her, huh?
__Howard Not exactly.
__Penny What do you mean, not exactly?
__Howard Well, things would be a little different.
__ Fantasy sequence in Mrs Wolowitz's house.
__ Howard, where's my lunch? I'm starving.
__Howard I know you're starving. The neighbours know you're starving. There's starving people in Africa who know you're starving.
__Mrs Wolowitz That's it? There's not enough food.
__Howard Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don't know what else to do.
__Howard You didn't let me finish. Here you go, Mother.
__Dead Mrs Wolowitz You're a good boy, Howard, such a good boy.
__ End fantasy sequence.
__ Wait, did she die or did you kill her?
__Howard Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she's dead.
__Bernadette Hey, so how come you two didn't move in together?
__Leonard Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies' man.
__ Fantasy scene in Raj's apartment.
__ Come on, Leonard, dinner.
__Fat Leonard Coming.
__Leonard Hang on. Why would I be fat?
__Raj You'd have no girlfriend to see you naked, you'd try to fill the void with food, and I'm an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.
__Leonard Why can't you be fat, too?
__Fat Leonard What do you want to do for dessert?
__Fat Raj I think there's still half a cake from breakfast.
__Fat Leonard No, there's not.
__Fat Stuart Hey, guys.
__Fat Leonard and Raj Stuart!
__ End fantasy sequence.
__ What are you doing?
__Stuart I just wanted to be in anyone's story.
__Raj Yeah, but why are you fat?
__Stuart ‘Cause Leonard was fat.
__Penny Amy, what about you? What do you think you'd be doing if you never met Sheldon?
__Amy It's hard to say, my life would be so different.
__Howard You can say better. Sheldon can't hear you.
__Amy I don't know.
__ Fantasy sequence in Amy's apartment.
__ Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there's tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me.
__ End fantasy sequence.
__ I'll stop now.
__Amy How's it going, Sheldon?
__Sheldon That's it. The baby's here. It's a boy.
__Penny Aw.
__Amy Yay.
__Raj Congrats.
__Sheldon Oh, thank you. I wasn't sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.
__Leonard Well, good for you, buddy. We'll let you get back in there.
__Sheldon Oh no, no, I'm not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.
__Howard Aw, he's already taking after Uncle Shelly.
__Amy Come on, Sheldon, you should go.
__Sheldon Why?
__Amy Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.
__Sheldon Ugh, all right, I'll go. But from what I've seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.
__Bernadette You actually got him to do it.
__Rajj Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you've clearly had an impact on him.
__Amy If that were true, I wouldn't still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon's T-shirts on it.
__Leonard I'm telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.
__Amy I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn't a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.
__Leonard Hang on, I'm gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I'm gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he'd probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that's fine. Look.
__Amy I don't understand.
__Leonard He made you his screensaver.
__Amy Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where'd I go?
__Leonard Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you're in the mix.
__Penny Who's that?
__Leonard Oh, Madame Curie.
__Amy Just really glad you're back.
__Sheldon Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.
__Amy I missed you.
__Sheldon To quote Han Solo, I know.
__Amy Did you miss me?
__Sheldon I would've preferred to have you there with me.
__Amy Oh.
__Sheldon Or instead of me.
__Amy Did you hold the baby?
__Sheldon I did.
__Amy And? How did it make you feel?
__Sheldon Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn't begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.
__ Fantasy sequence at the Cheesecake Factory.
__ I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna ask her out.
__Howard And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.
__Fat Raj Put up or shut up. You make it, I'll drink it.
__Penny You guys need anything else?
__Fat Leonard Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.
__Penny I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?
__Stuart Not until I get my kiss.
__Leonard Absolutely.
__Amy Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
__Sheldon We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don't have to.
__Penny Guys, guys, you're never gonna believe this.
__Leonard What happened?
__Penny I just got a part on a TV show.
__Amy Congratulations.
__Leonard What? That's great. Guys.
__Howard Oh, yeah
__Sheldon Yay, Penny.
__Amy What's the show?
__Penny Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don't know, it's, it's, you know, it's the one with the letters and I'm gonna be on it!
__Leonard That's amazing.
__Penny Yeah.
__Howard What's your part?
__Penny Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.
__Raj Ooh, Mark Harmon, he's a dreamboat.
__Leonard So it, it's just flirting?
__Penny Well, yeah. Why?
__Leonard Uh, no reason. I just think it's sexier when things are left to the imagination.
__Amy He's wrong.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
__Raj I don't see why not.
__Howard If you're really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.
__Sheldon Why is that funny? That's just unhygienic.
__Leonard It's a joke.
__Sheldon I don't think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz's mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don't usually change. Well, they don't.
__Penny Hey, guys, don't forget, my episode's on TV tomorrow night.
__Howard We'll be there.
__Raj Can we bring anything?
__Penny Oh, that's so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.
__Sheldon Wait, if Howard's mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she's obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you.
__Leonard No. Do you?
__Sheldon I think I'm hysterical.
__Leonard I take it back. That was funny.
__Sheldon The philosopher Henri Bergson says it's funny when a human being behaves like an object.
__Leonard I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
__Sheldon Oh, he didn't perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.
__Leonard You know, I think we're zeroing in on your problem.
__Sheldon Perhaps I'll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they're German, 'cause that's a tough crowd.
__Leonard Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you're cool with at you…
__Sheldon I don't get it.
__Howard Really? I never for a second thought it'd be anything else.
__Raj I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn't it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other's butts?
__Bernadette Well, Stuart's cute in his own way.
__Stuart When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.
__Raj Are possums cute?
__Stuart Not at all.
__Howard If you're so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.
__Bernadette Or maybe just stop talking.
__Howard I'm serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won't be so scary.
__Bernadette Or just keep dating the possum.
__Leonard I'm so proud of you.
__Penny We haven't even gotten to my scene yet.
__Sheldon I don't know about you, but I'm very uncomfortable with all this.
__Amy Why?
__Sheldon I've never seen this show before and now I'm starting with episode 246? It's unnatural.
__Amy Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.
__Man on TV I guess it's you and me, kid.
__Mark Harmon on TV What are you doing?
__Woman on TV I'm trying to make peace.
__Woman on TV Good.
__Mark Harmon on TV Really? Because…
__Penny Are you kidding me?
__Leonard What's wrong?
__Penny Well, the diner scene. Where's my diner scene?
__Sheldon Well, don't ask me. Until I see the prequel, I'm lost.
__Penny No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it's gone.
__Bernadette What happened?
__Penny They must've cut it.
__Leonard Oh, Penny, I'm, I'm sorry.
__Howard That stinks.
__Raj I'm sure you were great.
__Penny This doesn't make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.
__Sheldon I've been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let's tickle some ribs.
__Leonard How you doing?
__Penny Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he's missing and the sandwich is missing, and they're probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.
__Leonard You still got the part. That's a huge accomplishment.
__Penny Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that's gonna happen.
__Leonard Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn't gonna happen anyway.
__Penny Unbelievable.
__Leonard Oh, come on, no, that's not what I meant.
__Penny Then what did you mean?
__Leonard I don't, look, you know, words don't always have to mean things.
__Penny I think you meant that you don't believe in me.
__Leonard Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn't mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.
__Penny I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.
__Leonard Right.
__Penny Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny So you think I'll be on TV and in movies and win awards.
__Leonard Honestly?
__Penny Yes, honestly.
__Leonard I don't.
__Penny How could you say that?
__Leonard I don't know, I got all confused when you said honestly.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn't Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we'll come back to that.
__Penny No, please. Don't stop, go on. Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.
__Leonard That is not what I said. Look, I think you're really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you're shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.
__Penny Wow, thank you.
__Leonard Should've let Sheldon come.
__Amy Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…
__Sheldon BRAIN LESIONS!
__Amy Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn't funny.
__Sheldon Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
__Amy Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological…  Okay, that's pretty good.
__Sheldon Excellent.
__Raj No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
__Stuart Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?
__Raj That depends. On any level, do you think she's hot?
__Stuart We'll find somebody else.
__Amy I guess.
__Sheldon Ointment?
__Amy Sure.
__Amy I don't think I want to go out with you anymore.
__Sheldon Will you please stop joking around? I'm trying to figure this out.
__Amy Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?
__Voice on TV All right, baby, here's the deal.
__Penny And you didn't get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn't get your part cut!
__Leonard Hey. Can we talk?
__Penny We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.
__Leonard That was really crappy of me. What you're trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.
__Penny Are you serious? For what?
__Leonard The new Star Wars movie.
__Penny What? How did you manage that?
__Leonard There's this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.
__Penny Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.
__Leonard So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you're an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.
__Penny Really, let it go.
__Leonard Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.
__Raj Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she's gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.
__Stuart We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.
__Raj I don't know. They're dressed very stylishly. They're probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they're the one. We're gonna die here.
__Bernadette Hey.
__Howard Where's Sheldon?
__Amy He's home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
__Bernadette That's interesting.
__Amy It's exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?
__Bernadette If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.
__Howard Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?
__Bernadette No, of course not.
__Howard Well, I'd be able to tell anyway.
__Bernadette I don't think you would.
__Howard Please, I've made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.  Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.
__Penny Hey.
__Penny Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn't mean to call it idiotic.
__Leonard Well, I don't think you called it idiotic.
__Penny Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn't mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.
__Leonard Come on. It's okay.
__Leonard No, you're not.
__Penny Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn't the only one in there.
__Leonard Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.
__Penny No, it's not, okay? I've been out here for, like, ten years. I've nothing to show for it.
__Leonard Well, you have me.
__Penny You're right. I do have you. Mm. Let's get married.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?
__Leonard Um…
__Penny Did you seriously just say um?
__Leonard Look, you know I love you but, but you're, you're drunk and sad and feeling lost.
__Penny Okay, so, so you don't want to marry me?
__Leonard That is not what I said.
__Penny No, forget it. I take it back. Offer's off the table.
__Sheldon Who's in the mood to laugh?
__Leonard Really not a good time.
__Sheldon But I used science to construct the perfect joke.
__Penny I'm gonna go.
__Leonard Penny, don't.
__Penny No, no, I just need to be alone.
__Sheldon So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?
__Leonard To my room.
__Sheldon Should I follow you?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Leonard, wait.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
__Raj That's a mirror.
__Stuart Oh, yeah.
__Security Guard Hey, fellas, mall's closing.
__Raj Sorry.
__Security Guard Yeah. Good night.
__Raj Uh, excuse me.
__Security Guard Yeah?
__Raj Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?
__Security Guard It's all right.
__Raj Okay, nice talking to you.
__Stuart Smooth.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Would you like to talk about it?
__Leonard Penny proposed, and I didn't say yes.
__Sheldon Why not?
__Leonard That's a good question.
__Leonard I don't know.
__Sheldon Why don't you ask her?
__Leonard Because I'm afraid to know the answer.
__Sheldon Well, I'm sorry.
__Leonard That's it? You're not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
__Sheldon No. You're my friend, and, I'm sorry.
__Leonard Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
__Bernadette How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it's empty?
__Howard I'm in the middle of something.
__Bernadette So am I.
__Leonard I know.
__Sheldon The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.
__Leonard You need to let it go, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.
__Leonard Oh, my God, they're just making you use your vacation days.
__Sheldon But I don't want a vacation.
__Leonard Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through, but I'm a little distracted right now.
__Sheldon Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?
__Leonard It doesn't.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Sheldon I'm going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  Penny. Sorry.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Look, I'm sorry I didn't text you back. I just needed some time to think.
__Leonard Okay.
__Penny Yeah. Come in.
__Leonard Look, if you want to break up, just say it.
__Penny Leonard…
__Leonard No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don't say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.
__Penny Listen, I don't want to break up with you.
__Leonard Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it's cool if I cry a little?
__Penny Yeah, I probably wouldn't.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.
__Leonard Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.
__Penny Great, because I've been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.
__Leonard Wow. That, that's a big step.
__Penny I know.
__Leonard So, well, before making any rash…
__Penny I already quit.
__Leonard And I support you.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard No. You're on vacation.
__Sheldon Please. What if there's a big breakthrough in science today and I'm not there to see it?
__Leonard Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
__Leonard Bye.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Please.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Too bad. I'm coming with you.
__Leonard Oh, Sheldon, stay.
__Leonard I said stay. I'm going to work. Do not follow me.
__Stuart Hey.
__Bernadette Sorry. Did I startle you?
__Stuart Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?
__Bernadette Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard's comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.
__Stuart Wow. What happened?
__Bernadette Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
__Stuart Well, don't let The Riddler know that. It's a comic book joke. Or maybe it's not.
__Bernadette Do you have this one?
__Stuart Uh, well, it's, it's pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?
__Bernadette Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.
__Stuart Oh. What's the hurry?
__Bernadette Well, he's always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.
__Stuart Well, I'll do what I can, but I can't make any promises.
__Bernadette You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.
__Stuart Really? Do you have any of these?
__Amy Hey, what brings you guys here?
__Raj Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you'd like to join.
__Amy Why? Because Sheldon's not here this week, and you don't think I have any other options? I'm just kidding. I'll get my purse.
__Bert Hi, Amy. I, oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you had any company.
__Amy That's okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.
__Howard Hi.
__Raj Hey. Good to see you.
__Bert Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.
__Amy This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.
__Bert Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?
__Howard You're both into rock?
__Bert Yeah. Well, see ya.
__Amy Oh, you forgot your quartz.
__Bert Oh, it's okay. I want you to have it. Bye.
__Amy He's nice.
__Howard Yeah, he's nice because he likes you.
__Amy What?! No, he doesn't.
__Raj He brought you a pretty rock.
__Amy So? He does that every day. Oh.
__Howard You know, if you'd rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it's totally okay.
__Amy He's not my boyfriend.
__Raj Are you sure? He's tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.
__Amy Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
__Raj Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.
__Amy What do I do? I don't want to hurt his feelings.
__Howard Maybe the problem is he thinks you're available. Does he know you're dating Sheldon?
__Amy I guess it hasn't come up.
__Howard There you go.
__Raj And does Sheldon know you're dating Sheldon?
__Amy I'm sorry. Who are you dating?
__Raj Yeah, knock it off, Howard.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny You okay?
__Penny Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
__Sheldon Leonard told me to stay.
__Penny Oh. Well, good boy.
__Sheldon Where are you going?
__Penny Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.
__Sheldon Well, have fun.
__Penny Okay. You want to come with me?
__Sheldon Really?
__Penny Come on, boy. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Get in the car. Come on.
__Bernadette Oh, that's great.
__Stuart No, it's not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He's always making me feel bad about myself.
__Bernadette Oh, that's terrible. What's the address?
__Stuart You know, why don't I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn't rip you off.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Howard So, what is she doing today?
__Leonard I don't know. She already thinks I don't support this, so if I call, it might look like I'm checking up on her.
__Leonard Of course I do. She's a great actress. I'm proud she's taking this risk.
__Amy That's nice.
__Leonard You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.
__Penny Hi. What's up?
__Leonard Oh, how's it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?
__Leonard You got your job back. That is great news. I didn't want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.
__Penny Yeah. I'm just returning my uniform.
__Leonard And I support you.
__Sheldon Okay. I'm inside the CERN super collider.
__Voice Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.
__Sheldon Wow. Didn't see that coming.
__Voice In.
__Sheldon Let me guess.
__Voice And out.
__Penny I didn't get it.
__Sheldon A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.
__Penny Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
__Sheldon Do you see me drinking lemonade?
__Penny No. I'm serious.
__Sheldon Why do you ask?
__Penny Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
__Sheldon No, I don't think you are.
__Penny Really?
__Sheldon The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn't take some other job in case it didn't work out. Which wasn't easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.
__Penny Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can't Leonard understand it?
__Sheldon Because he's not like us, Penny. We're dreamers.
__Penny Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.
__Amy Hello, Bert.
__Bert So, anyway, there's this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.
__Amy Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.
__Bert Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.
__Amy Weren't you?
__Bert Yeah.
__Amy That's very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.
__Bert That's what you all say. You just don't want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.
__Amy No, that's not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.
__Bert Don't worry. I'm used to it. I mean, I'm big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.
__Amy Don't say that.
__Bert It's okay. I know I'm a monster.
__Amy No, Bert, come on. I'd love to go to the mineral show with you.
__Bert Sweet. It's a date.
__Amy No, it's not.
__Bert Too late.
__Stuart Yeah. Haven't seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.
__Jesse Hey, Stuart.
__Stuart Jesse.
__Jesse Haven't seen you in forever. Look how grey you've gotten.
__Stuart My hair's exactly the same colour as always.
__Jesse No, I was talking about your skin.
__Stuart Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.
__Jesse Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.
__Stuart Even you, Sweatpants?
__Sweatpants Free popcorn.
__Jesse Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?
__Bernadette No, thanks.
__Jesse How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?
__Bernadette Hey.
__Jesse I'm just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.
__Stuart It's on Merton Avenue.
__Bernadette I don't think I like the way you're treating my friend.
__Jesse Sorry. You want the book or not?
__Bernadette Not from you. Let's go, Stuart.
__Stuart You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.
__Jesse What's that?
__Stuart Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.
__Amy So what am I supposed to do now?
__Raj Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
__Amy This isn't funny. I'm gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn't have a boyfriend, I wouldn't be interested in him.
__Howard Oh, I've heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.
__Howard Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.
__Raj Megan Pincus.
__Howard Tammy Cho.
__Raj Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?
__Howard Arlene Russel.
__Raj Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
__Howard Poor Bert. That guy's got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
__Amy Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn't interested?
__Raj I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.
__Howard That's how you reject a guy.
__Amy Okay, I don't have time for this. I'm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.
__Howard No, don't.
__Raj He'll be so upset. He'll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
__Howard You want us to talk to him?
__Amy Really? You would do that?
__Raj Sure. We've both been in his shoes. We'll let him down with compassion and respect.
__Amy Thank you.
__Howard Let's go.
__Raj So we tell him she's a lesbian, right?
__Howard Of course we tell him she's a lesbian.
__Sheldon I've read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
__Penny Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna get to do that today.
__Sheldon Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
__Leonard Oh, hey.
__Penny And now we go to Reverse Warrior.
__Leonard How did she get you to do yoga?
__Sheldon Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.
__Penny I'm helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.
__Leonard Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.
__Penny Sheldon, take a break.
__Sheldon Namaste.
__Penny Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?
__Leonard Fine. I'm not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn't you ask me before you did it?
__Penny Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?
__Leonard Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I'm wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we're actually in.
__Penny Yeah, well, maybe we do.
__Sheldon I'm willing to if you guys are.
__Leonard Can we please have some privacy?
__Sheldon Y, No. I'm as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it's high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny Okay, wait. What are we doing?
__Leonard For some reason, we're planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.
__Sheldon Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
__Penny Look, I know you think I'm being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.
__Sheldon Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22.
__Leonard I swear, I am on your side.
__Penny You keep saying you're on my side, but you don't act like it.
__Sheldon He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?
__Leonard Listen, I could never do what you're doing, okay? I would be terrified.
__Penny Well, it's scary for me, too.
__Sheldon I'm fine with it.
__Leonard My point is, just because I couldn't do it doesn't mean you shouldn't. And I'm proud of you.
__Penny Okay. Thank you.
__Sheldon Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let's all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you'll need a straw.
__Bernadette Yes, I am, there's a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart's store is just fine, and he's a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I'd like to buy it right now.
__Jesse No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?
__Bernadette No, I don't want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone.
__Jesse I only have chocolate chip.
__Bernadette Well, that sounds even better.
__Raj We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.
__Howard Really, really sorry.
__Bert Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!
__Raj Oh, it all comes down to this.
__Leonard Oh, I've got butterflies.
__Sheldon Don't get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.
__Penny What's going on?
__Leonard Hey. We're about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.
__Penny Oh.
__Howard T Minus 45 seconds.
__Leonard They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…
__Sheldon Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.
__Penny This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.
__Howard T-minus 30 seconds.
__Raj Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.
__Sheldon Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.
__Raj And I told you I get diaper rash.
__Howard 15 seconds.
__Leonard Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.
__Howard Five, four, three, two, one.
__Sheldon It's live. Go, go, go, go, go.
__Raj Anyone in?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Not yet.
__Howard Nope.
__Sheldon Do not stop refreshing your screens.
__All Refresh. Refresh. Refresh….
__Penny Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard It's been ten minutes. We're running out of time.
__Penny To be cool? Yeah.
__Leonard I did it, I did it, I'm in the queue.
__Sheldon Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.
__Raj Uh, what number in line are you?
__Leonard Uh, fifteen…
__Howard Great.
__Leonard …thousand two hundred and eleven.
__Howard Damn.
__Raj Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.
__Howard Really?
__Leonard Oh, Thursday's gone. Just Sunday left.
__Sheldon Oh, Sunday's the worst. Everybody's leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.
__Leonard Sunday's gone.
__Sheldon Not Sunday, I love Sunday.
__Raj So that's it? Everything's sold out?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Howard I can't believe we're not going.
__Sheldon It's okay. You know, there, there's always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that's just as good. Excuse me.
__Penny Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.
__Sheldon I can't believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
__Penny What? You were all going as the Hulk?
__Howard Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.
__Raj We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
__All Yeah.
__Penny And we're back to the first kind of sad.
__Leonard Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.
__Sheldon I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You're gonna feel pretty silly when we're 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.
__Leonard Do what you want. We're getting scalped tickets.
__Howard I already found a guy online who's willing to sell.
__Sheldon How do you know this isn't a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?
__Leonard The same way I know that the people in the TV set can't see me.
__Howard Sheldon, just come with us. You're not gonna make your own convention.
__Sheldon You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn't exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I'm gonna rip that guy off.
__Leonard Did you tell them that you're holding your convention at a Marie Callender's, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?
__Sheldon I didn't even get to that part.
__Leonard Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.
__Sheldon Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn't a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that's the same day that he shampoos his beard.
__Leonard Sheldon, buddy, I just don't think this is going to come together for you.
__Sheldon You don't know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
__Leonard Good luck.
__Sheldon No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, 'cause, legally, I'm not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, 'cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.
__Amy Last week, you spent that on a little dress.
__Penny Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.
__Bernadette Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he's never gonna put his toys away.
__Amy Why can't they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?
__Bernadette Well, while they're acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up.
__Amy Oh. You mean like a museum?
__Penny Yes, like a museum, but anything else.
__Bernadette Oh, I know. There's a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.
__Amy Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.
__Penny Oh, all right, if we're gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.
__Bernadette La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.
__Penny No, we're gonna stop at Target on the way.
__Leonard Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.
__Howard Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don't exist were over.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.
__Leonard Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
__Sheldon I don't think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King's dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.
__Raj How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
__Sheldon Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he's looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That's where he'll be, and that's where I'm going, and…
__Howard And that's where Darth Vader's gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
__Leonard Sheldon, I don't care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don't be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You're gonna get in trouble.
__Sheldon You're the ones who are going to get in trouble. You're buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I'm warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there.  Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…
__Raj Does he sound like a criminal?
__Howard What do you mean?
__Raj You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?
__Leonard Yes. He, he's late because he's on his way here from 1940.
__Raj I'm just saying, we don't know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?
__Howard Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
__Raj I don't know. Maybe 'cause dark doesn't show the stains?
__Howard Why do you think I told him to come to your place?
__Penny I can't believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
__Bernadette I can't believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.
__Amy Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster.
__Bernadette That's cute.
__Amy It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.
__Penny Well, there's a bar in the lobby.
__Bernadette I could go for a drink.
__Amy Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.
__Sheldon Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you'd think I was a creepy stalker.
__James Earl Jones Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.
__Sheldon He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.
__Leonard Maybe this isn't a good idea.
__Howard I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.
__Raj Do it.
__Howard Okay. We're officially not going to Comic-Con.
__Leonard Hold on. We always do this.
__Howard Do what?
__Leonard Chicken out. We're, we're so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.
__Raj That's 'cause we're the good guys.
__Leonard Even Batman breaks the rules.
__Raj You know I struggle with Batman.
__Leonard I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let's be badasses.
__Raj Okay, I'll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.
__Leonard Howard, you in on this?
__Howard No need. I'm breaking rules all the time.
__Leonard Name one.
__Raj What about that little cup they give you?
__Howard Yeah. What about it?
__Leonard A little.
__Sheldon Me, too. But he wasn't, was he?
__James He was not. How messed up was that?
__Sheldon So messed up.
__James What do you say let's go have some fun? My wife's in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket.
__Amy On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.
__Penny Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do.
__Bernadette Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I'm pretending. It doesn't help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.
__Penny Okay, so I'm an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would've heard me.
__Amy Gosh.
__Penny I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.
__Penny Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.
__Bernadette Yeah. Or you'd be the oldest one here.
__Penny Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
__Leonard Good. This is exciting.
__Raj It is. I feel alive.
__Leonard Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.
__Raj Maybe slapped with a fine.
__Howard Oh, no. I'd be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?
__Raj Uh, maybe it'll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?
__Leonard I wonder if we'd have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
__Raj He's gonna be here any second, what should we do?
__Howard Okay, you guys are such babies. I'll handle this. If he thinks we're not home, he'll go away.
__Raj I thought you were a badass.
__Howard I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.
__James It is true.
__Sheldon Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?
__James They sure did.
__Sheldon Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
__James That's right.
__Sheldon Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.
__Bernadette Well, for starters, we'd be splitting this check three ways.
__Penny I'm serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.
__Amy I told you it was Penny.
__Penny Oh, come on, it wasn't me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.
__Amy Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I'm sure they're having more fun than we are.
__James I am.
__James Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…
__Sheldon Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh.
__James Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…
__James Shh.
__Sheldon Whose house is this?
__James Carrie Fisher. And she's a little crazy, so get ready to run.
__Carrie Fisher It's not funny anymore, James.
__James Then why am I laughing?
__Sheldon Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.
__James What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?
__Sheldon Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?
__James No. Something about a convention.
__Sheldon Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn't get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.
__James Why don't you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?
__Sheldon Really?
__James Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I'm taking you every night.
__Sheldon Ay-yi-yi.
__James Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, who's Angie Dickinson?
__Amy I'm sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.
__Sheldon Well, you don't like Princess Corncob, you don't like Fester, you're just impossible to please.
__Amy We'll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine's Day.
__Sheldon Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.
__Amy Before you get upset, I believe I've come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.
__Sheldon People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.
__Amy I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.
__Sheldon I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.
__Sheldon For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.
__Amy One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.
__Sheldon Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We've only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.
__Amy I got you your own room.
__Sheldon What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
__Amy It doesn't. I know it makes you feel like you're bathing inside a monster.
__Sheldon Look, I appreciate the effort, but I'm still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.
__Amy We're going to have Valentine's Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
__Sheldon Vintage? Be specific.
__Amy An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.
__Sheldon Wow. I'm feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we're good.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny No, I think we're just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.
__Leonard Plus, I'm not sure it's a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It's a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it's all for laughs.
__Penny That would really piss me off if I didn't have a buzz going on.
__Sheldon Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?
__Howard I'm sorry, what?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.
__Howard I don't own a pocket watch.
__Sheldon Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.
__Raj Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine's, would you mind watching Cinnamon?
__Penny You have Valentine's plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can't do it.
__Raj I don't have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
__Amy Well, an evening looking at the stars, that's still kind of romantic.
__Raj Except I'll be alone.
__Amy I'm trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.
__Leonard We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
__Penny Yeah.
__Raj Thank you. Oh, and I'd like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it's cool if she stays in the room.
__Penny Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.
__Sheldon It's magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.
__Amy I'm so glad you like it.
__Sheldon I'm prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.
__Penny Happy Valentine's Day.
__Leonard Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody's trying to get me out of my panties.
__Penny Don't be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.
__Leonard Got you a little something, too.
__Penny Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?
__Leonard It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.
__Penny Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
__Leonard Thank you. Seriously, please don't make me go.
__Penny Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
__Leonard Mm, don't have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.
__Penny Oh, that's true.
__Leonard In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon's spot.
__Penny That is the least sexy thing anyone's ever said to me.
__Leonard To the bedroom.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
__Waiter I'm sorry, I meant questions about the food.
__Amy Uh, I think we're gonna need a minute.
__Man in seat behind Fun fact, it's neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you'll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.
__Sheldon Get out of town.
__Howard Fun fact, I'm gonna jump off this train.
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Leonard It's a little late, but I'll take it.
__Penny No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That's really bad for dogs.
__Penny We gotta get her to a vet right now.
__Leonard I don't have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You'd think I'd have a vet.
__Penny Okay. There's one not far from here. Come on. Let's go.
__Leonard Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.
__Man Okay. Here's my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.
__Sheldon It's like there' Oh, yeah. I've got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.
__Man I've been on that train. And I just was again.
__Amy See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
__Sheldon How many trains have you been on?
__Man Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
__Sheldon Wow. Your life's amazing.
__Man Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
__Amy Why do I even try?
__Bernadette I'm gonna fix this right now.
__Howard Okay. Just make it look like an accident.
__Bernadette Excuse me. You are at Valentine's dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.
__Sheldon You're right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.
__Man All right.
__Bernadette Great. Now there's two of 'em.
__Penny A whole box.
__Leonard Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.
__Penny So the point is I may have saved her life.
__Vet I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?
__Leonard No. Maybe to her.
__Vet How big a box of chocolate was it?
__Penny Uh, something like this. I don't know. It came free with a full tank of gas.
__Penny Do you know how much gas is?
__Vet Hey.
__Penny Sorry.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Raj Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can't believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I'll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.
__Raj Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.
__Vet Well, she's not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I'm gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.
__Raj Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she's scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don't do Firework, that gets her all riled up.
__Vet Got it. Should have been a dentist.
__Sheldon Trick question. There never was one.
__Man Or was there?
__Sheldon What?
__Man In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.
__Sheldon In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?
__Howard A world I don't want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.
__Man Hold on to your conductor's hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.
__Sheldon I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?
__Waiter Better than you think.
__Man You know, if you ask nicely, they'll let you visit the engine room.
__Sheldon I never want this day to end.
__Amy It's feeling like it never will.
__Sheldon Come on.
__Man Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?
__Penny It wasn't cheap. It was free.
__Leonard We're really sorry. It was an accident.
__Leonard Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.
__Raj Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?
__Vet She's responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.
__Raj All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We're usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I'm here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.
__Vet It's okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We're not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.
__Raj Thank you.
__Vet Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
__Raj Oh, yeah?
__Vet And I don't care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.
__Penny I think there's something going on between the two of them.
__Leonard Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn't a while, so what do you know?
__Amy Why? Because my boyfriend's off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
__Howard Well, to be fair, they're both weirdos.
__Amy I don't know what made me think tonight would be any different.
__Bernadette Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200
__ bucks it wasn't gonna happen.
__ I'm going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.
__Bernadette See? It's not just Sheldon. They're all idiots.
__Howard She's right.
__Bernadette So, your boyfriend's a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he's been to space. That's all me.
__Howard I had a little to do with it.
__Bernadette Oh, sure you did. Who's Mama's big space man?
__Howard I am.
__Penny Yeah, for future reference, that's a while.
__Leonard How long should we stay?
__Penny I don't know. I'm kind of hungry.
__Leonard I saw a Thai place next door.
__Penny Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
__Leonard How's she doing?
__Penny How is everything?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Raj She's gonna be okay; they're gonna let me take her home.
__Penny Oh, good.
__Vet So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don't hesitate to call.
__Raj Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
__Vet My pleasure. Have a nice night.
__Leonard Yes, thank you for all your help.
__Penny Yeah. I'm sorry if you didn't think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.
__Vet Oh, do you guys own any pets?
__Penny No.
__Vet Good.
__Bernadette I love you, too.
__Bernadette Sorry.
__Man You guys missed a pretty great time.
__Sheldon The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.
__Man It was crazy.
__Sheldon Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.
__Amy Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.
__Howard There's a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?
__Bernadette Oh, that sounds so romantic.
__Amy Oh, give it a rest.
__Amy Why are you still here?
__Sheldon Excuse me. I think you're being a little rude.
__Amy I'm being rude? You've been rude to me this entire evening.
__Sheldon How is that possible? I've hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
__Man I'm detecting a little friction between you two, and I don't want to be a third rail. Get it?
__Sheldon I get it.
__Sheldon What is your problem?
__Amy It's Valentine's Day. We're supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
__Sheldon Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?
__Amy Fine, it's true. I deserve romance, and I didn't know how else to make it happen.
__Sheldon Well, if you want romance, then let's have romance. Oh, look, there's wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let's gaze into each other's eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon Let's see. What's next? Oh, kissing's romantic.
__Amy That was nice.
__Sheldon Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he'd show me how to bring the train through a crossing.
__Amy Okay, have fun.
__Sheldon Do you want to come with me?
__Amy Really? I do.
__Man Hey, guys, wait up.
__Leonard Oh, hey. You're back. How was your trip?
__Sheldon It was wonderful.
__Leonard Great. What did you do?
__Sheldon I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.
__Leonard Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna need more details.
__Sheldon Oh, well, my new friend's name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.
__Leonard No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?
__Sheldon Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
__Leonard Well, give it a go.
__Sheldon I can't answer that without collecting additional data.
__Leonard Additional data. You dog.
__Sheldon I'm not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.
__Raj Oh, actually that's a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.
__Leonard Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?
__Raj You mean a moo-stache?
__Leonard Moo-stache.
__Howard He said it.
__Raj Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.
__Howard Say what?
__Raj Moo-stache.
__Leonard Moo-stache.
__Howard He said it.
__Bernadette Guys, you're being childish.
__Sheldon Yeah, she's right. You're grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.
__Penny Hi. Sorry I'm late, I was at an audition.
__Sheldon You'll get 'em next time.
__Penny How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?
__Leonard Sorry. How did it go?
__Penny Just shut up.
__Raj Here, you can have your seat.
__Bernadette Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
__Amy Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.
__Raj Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl's there ten seconds, and suddenly we're all running to IKEA.
__Sheldon No one is running anywhere. We're not getting a dining room table.
__Leonard I know you don't like change, but it's not a terrible idea.
__Penny Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?
__Howard Hey, how come we never get that option?
__Sheldon Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.
__Penny Translation?
__Leonard Waah. I don't want a table.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon You know, I'd love to, but, um, I'm too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.
__Leonard Seriously? You haven't used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you're up here working?
__Sheldon I can't talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.
__Leonard Are you really gonna sit here all day?
__Sheldon Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.
__Sheldon It's a made-up story, Leonard, I don't even know why you're talking about it.
__Leonard I'm putting all this stuff in storage. We don't need any of it.
__Sheldon You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.
__Leonard Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.
__Sheldon Wait. Is this really worth it? We've lived together for years with nary an argument.
__Leonard Huh?
__Sheldon But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we're at each other's throats.
__Leonard Nary an argument? Nary?
__Sheldon Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don't know if I won that, but at least he's upset.
__Raj Magic wand TV remote?
__Howard Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.
__Raj Did Bernadette think it was cool?
__Howard Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.
__Raj Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.
__Howard Well, that's the last time I play with that.  I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137
__Raj Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.
__Howard Okay. Thank you. We'll be in touch. You're not gonna believe this.
__Raj What's going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What's going on?
__Howard That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.
__Raj Wow. What did you tell them?
__Howard I told them I'd be honoured.
__Raj A second trip to space, I'll miss you.
__Howard And I'm gonna miss you, too.
__Raj And I just want you to know, I'm happy to look in on Bernadette while you're gone.
__Raj And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I'm just kidding. We'll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.
__Leonard No. Sheldon doesn't like reclaimed wood.
__Penny Why not?
__Leonard He's afraid the original owners will come back.
__Penny Yeah. Well, Sheldon's not here.
__Leonard Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there's nothing I can do about it.
__Leonard I know, but…
__Penny No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.
__Leonard You're right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can't both have Frodo, so guess who's stuck with Samwise Gamgee.
__Penny See? Right there. You're a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn't, but one problem at a time.
__Leonard You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I'm getting it.
__Penny Really? This one?
__Leonard That one? Damn right I like that one.
__Howard Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.
__Bernadette Fine. Can I at least shower first?
__Howard No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.
__Bernadette What are you talking about?
__Howard Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.
__Bernadette Wow. Well, what did you say?
__Howard What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?
__Bernadette Well, it's just, after last time, I didn't think you'd ever want to go back.
__Howard Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.
__Bernadette Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.
__Howard I think you have me confused with what's gonna happen when you get out of that shower.
__Sheldon My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It's called a TV.
__Penny Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.
__Sheldon You're absolutely right. Nope.
__Penny Well, you can't say he didn't give it a fair shot.
__Sheldon So, when can we get rid of it?
__Leonard We're not.
__Sheldon What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.
__Penny Come on, that is ridiculous.
__Leonard She's right, a committee that important should meet more often.
__Penny That's not what I'm saying.
__Leonard Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
__Penny Yes.
__Leonard That.
__Sheldon Okay. I think we've found the problem here. It's not the table at all. It's you.
__Penny Me?
__Leonard Well, it's always me, take one for the team.
__Sheldon I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.
__Penny Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
__Leonard Fancy sounds like a compliment.
__Penny Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That's just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy's changed you.
__Sheldon That's not true.
__Penny Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you're holding hands, you're going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.
__Sheldon She told you?
__Penny Of course she told me, it's the most interesting thing that's ever happened to her in her entire life.
__Leonard You're too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.
__Sheldon You're right. Without realizing it, I've allowed that woman to alter my personality.
__Leonard Mm, Sheldon, you didn't have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.
__Sheldon No. No, I've changed. Like the frog who's put in a pot of water that's heated so gradually he doesn't realize he's boiling to death.
__Penny Or you're the frog who's been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
__Leonard Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.
__Penny Oh, Sheldon, wait.
__Sheldon No. You've opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.
__Leonard Well, we should call her.
__Penny Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it's Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon's breaking up with you.
__Amy I'm not surprised you want to end the relationship. I'm a little surprised you didn't get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?
__Sheldon At the bottom. I must say, I'm relieved you're not making more of a scene out of this.
__Amy Oh, I've already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.
__Sheldon Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?
__Amy All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn't gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?
__Sheldon It is hideous.
__Amy Well, thankfully, I won't have to see it, 'cause I won't be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.
__Sheldon Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
__Amy Of course I was.
__Sheldon Wait. How do I know that you're not manipulating me right now?
__Amy I think if I were manipulating you, you'd be smart enough to see it.
__Sheldon How do I know you're not saying that as part of the manipulation?
__Amy I think you'd be smart enough to see that, too.
__Sheldon Okay. I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.
__Bermadette Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?
__Raj Course.
__Bernadette He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don't think he should do it again?
__Raj Not at all. He's forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It's like me in those moments when I miss India.
__Bernadette So you'll talk to him?
__Raj Why me?
__Bernadette Well, I'm his wife, I don't want to ruin it for him.
__Raj That's the dynamic, I'm the fun one, you're the buzzkill.
__Bernadette Since when am I the buzzkill?
__Raj Do you think this is cool?
__Bernadette No, I think it's stupid.
__Raj Aha.
__Bernadette You're right, it's great.
__Leonard Oh, hey. You guys didn't break up.
__Sheldon No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.
__Amy Which you also figured out by yourself.
__Sheldon Which I also figured out by myself.
__Penny Well, I'm glad you're still together.
__Sheldon Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.
__Sheldon Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.
__Howard But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.
__Sheldon Um.
__Amy You don't need to explain yourself to him.
__Sheldon I don't need to explain myself to you!
__Amy You're sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
__Sheldon Keep the table. We don't use that space.
__Amy Damn it, I got cocky.
__Bernadette Hi, honey.
__Howard What's going on?
__Bernadette Maybe you should have a seat.
__Howard Um, okay. I know my mom's not dead, there'd be balloons.
__Raj Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.
__Mike Rostenkowski Well, I wouldn't…
__Bernadette Daddy.
__Mike R You're great.
__Mike Massimino Can I say something?
__Raj Oh, of course.
__Mike M Hey, Fruit Loops.
__Howard Massimino? Why are you here?
__Mike M Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who's been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?
__Howard Sure.
__Mike M The stuff you have is wrong.
__Howard You don't think I did a good job up there?
__Mike M You did a fine job. It's just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.
__Bernadette I think what we're all trying to say is, you don't seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.
__Raj Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
__Mike R Like a woman. Great analogy.
__Howard Fine, maybe I was a little scared.
__Mike M You peed in your space suit.
__Howard You're supposed to do that.
__Mike M Not during the fitting.
__Mike R Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?
__Howard Hang on. That was just me joking around.
__Mike R You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.
__Howard Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.
__Bernadette Don't forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
__Raj And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.
__Mike M That was funny.
__Howard Okay, so I wasn't exactly John Glenn up there, but I've changed. I'm a different man now. Yeah, and I'm a little insulted that you guys don't think I can handle it.
__Mike M You know you're gonna have to go through survival training again.
__Howard Really?
__Doctor What do you want me to do? You're perfectly healthy.
__Howard Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second.
__Mrs Wolowitz Hello?
__Howard Hi, Ma. How are you?
__Mrs Wolowitz How I am is not dead, but you wouldn't know that, because you don't love me enough to pick up the phone.
__Howard Go, go, go.
__Mrs Wolowitz For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That's what happened to your Aunt Ida.
__Doctor Wow.
__Howard Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.
__Leonard But the mission wouldn't be for at least a year. Isn't that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
__Howard Look, my blood pressure's too high, okay? Drop it.
__Penny You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…
__Howard Went to space? I don't think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.
__Penny Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?
__Bernadette Yeah, it's fun up here.
__Leonard So why are you trying to ruin it?
__Sheldon No, thanks. We're fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that's what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we've always done things. But if those days are gone, they're gone. It just makes me sad.
__Bernadette Now I feel bad.
__Leonard Oh, don't anthropomorphize him, he's got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.
__Leonard Well, it's not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.
__Bernadette Look at Amy down there. Should we go?
__Penny Yeah, let's go.
__Leonard But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.
__Penny Forget it, Leonard. It's over.
__Leonard Fine.
__Amy Rajesh?
__Raj Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I'm staying right here.
__Bernadette Come on, Raj, it's not the same without you.
__Raj Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.
__Howard You mean tings like moo-stache?
__Sheldon Well, isn't this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.
__Raj Thank you. That was the closest I've come to sex in, like, two years.
__Bernadette Now I feel a little gross.
__Raj You're only making it seem more real for me.
__Howard Hey, that's my wife. If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.
__Raj Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
__Sheldon How about Penny's depressing acting career?
__Leonard Hey. I mean, it's been a little tough, but Penny's following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.
__Penny Aw, thank you.
__Howard Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
__Amy Can I borrow it when you're done?
__Penny Well, I'll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.
__Leonard Why would you do that?
__Penny Because it was crap. It's a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
__Bernadette Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.
__Sheldon She does. 42 minutes in.
__Raj While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
__Sheldon I have an eidetic memory. I don't know what his problem is.
__Penny Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
__Sheldon Am I missing something, or isn't that the part she was born to play?
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Well, I don't think it's the kind of part that's good for my career.
__Leonard Well, but don't a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?
__Penny Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”
__Raj If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.
__Leonard I don't know anything about show business, so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I'm sure you know what you're doing.
__Amy I think we're gonna go.
__Sheldon Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.
__Howard Hey, I work at the same university you do.
__Sheldon Yes, and Hawkeye's in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.
__Bernadette Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
__Penny Oh, I'm sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
__Leonard No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it's a fight.
__Sheldon Well, with that sorted out, I'm happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.
__Howard I didn't do anything. I was just sitting here.
__Sheldon I wasn't referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.
__Raj Ha-a-a. Still funny.
__Bernadette That was ten years ago.
__Sheldon Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.
__Amy Really?
__Howard The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That's funny.
__Raj I was there. It was funny.
__Sheldon In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
__Raj Actually, it's for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.
__Amy Why can't Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.
__Raj I don't appreciate your sarcasm, but we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.
__Amy Whatever happened with your online dating?
__Raj No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
__Amy Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.
__Raj It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
__Amy Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
__Raj What? You've kissed, like, once in three years.
__Amy That's true. Do whatever you want.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Howard Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.
__Sheldon Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
__Sheldon Very well. How do you propose we move forward?
__Howard Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.
__Sheldon That's a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
__Howard Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can't go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I'll show you around the space centre.
__Sheldon I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you've made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
__Howard No.
__Sheldon I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.
__Amy Oh. Let me guess. There's an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
__Raj I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl's profile. She's amazing.
__Amy Oh, she's cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.
__Raj And judging by her lack of Adam's apple, she's been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.
__Amy Great, so what do you need me for?
__Raj Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.
__Amy All right.
__Raj Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.
__Amy Wow.
__Raj I know. Powerful stuff, huh?
__Amy No. You're supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.
__Raj Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.
__Amy Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let's get a cup of coffee sometime.”
__Raj Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.
__Amy I'm not gonna pretend to be you.
__Raj I don't want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
__Amy Well, what would I say to her?
__Raj Just tell her what I'm really like. And, if you think it'll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.
__Penny Oh, it's no problem. Is everything okay?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm fine. It's just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.
__Penny Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn't sound good.
__Sheldon Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…
__Penny Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.
__Sheldon Maybe it's just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.
__Raj Teams are fun.
__Sheldon Oh, in that case, I'd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.
__Raj But I'm always on Howard's team. We're best friends. The kind who finish each others…
__Howard I really don't think we do tha…
__Raj Do that. See?
__Penny Oh, hi.
__Leonard Oh, how'd it go at the mechanic?
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Raj Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
__Howard Isn't it a little late to get plane tick…
__Raj Plane tickets? Yeah.
__Howard Will you please sto…
__Raj Stop that? Okay.
__Leonard I'm so sorry. I know it's a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?
__Penny I did. I called them. The part's gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl's gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
__Leonard At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
__Sheldon Leonard, would you wrap it up? We're waiting on you.
__Penny I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart interfering with your board game?
__Sheldon It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.
__Amy No. What's up?
__Raj Have you heard back from Emily?
__Amy I have.
__Raj Great. And?
__Amy And I'm afraid she doesn't think you're right for her.
__Amy I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn't write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.
__Raj I'm not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.
__Amy Look, I'll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.
__Raj What's happening tomorrow night?
__Amy I'm meeting her for coffee.
__Raj What?
__Amy Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.
__Raj I find a girl I like, and you're stealing her?
__Amy No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we're both hardcore into quilting.
__Bernadette What are you doing?
__Howard Oh, he's not coming out until he sees proof you don't have an air freshener in your car.
__Bernadette This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
__Howard You're the reason I'm doing it.
__Bernadette I said to stop insulting each other. I didn't tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
__Howard How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Howard Hey, buddy.
__Bernadette You excited for Texas?
__Sheldon Oh, very much so.
__Howard It's not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
__Sheldon Oh, who's the real astronaut?
__Howard Buzz Aldrin.
__Sheldon Oh. Yay.
__Howard What now?
__Sheldon I have to go to the bathroom.
__Howard You just went to the bathroom.
__Sheldon But I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.
__Howard Well, it still doesn't.
__Sheldon I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.
__Howard Fine.
__Sheldon Why are you getting annoyed?
__Howard I'm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.
__Sheldon Like when?
__Howard When? How about in the car? I'm an astronaut, and you know it. You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.
__Sheldon Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.
__Howard Thank you.
__Sheldon Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there. Aren't you going to let me out?
__Howard No.
__Sheldon But I still need to use the bathroom.
__Howard Here you go. Be creative. What's the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?
__Sheldon No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I'm not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
__Howard Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.
__Sheldon I take it back. I'm scared of turbulence!
__Howard I'm gonna need that bag back.
__Penny Yeah. Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back? It'll be fun to see everyone. I haven't talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let's just get this over with.
__Leonard Let's get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I'm just, I'm trying to lighten the mood.
__Penny I know. Thank you.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Penny It's just so humiliating.
__Leonard So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I'm sorry. I'll. I'll stop. I'll stop.
__Penny Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it's making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn't your car.
__Leonard I know. I thought we'd take yours.
__Penny I don't understand.
__Leonard It's nothing fancy, but it'll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don't have to go back to waitressing.
__Penny I don't know what to say.
__Leonard Don't say anything.
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Leonard I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.
__Raj Hello, Emily.
__Emily Hello.
__Raj Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?
__Emily No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.
__Raj Uh, okay, that's a separate issue. Let's put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
__Emily I'm leaving.
__Amy Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
__Raj Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.
__Howard I'm sorry, too. It's all my fault.
__Sheldon If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life.
__Sheldon Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.
__Announcement The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You're now free to move about the cabin.
__Howard It's over.
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Howard Should we stop holding hands now?
__Sheldon In a minute.
__Howard Okay, good.
__Raj He's in Texas, he'll never know.
__Penny I wouldn't be so sure about that.
__Leonard Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it's true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.
__Raj Have you heard from Howard?
__Bernadette I did. His talk at NASA went great.
__Penny Sheldon didn't heckle him?
__Bernadette No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.
__Stuart Hey, guys.
__Amy Oh, hi.
__Bernadette Hi, Stuart.
__Raj Hey, Stuart!
__Stuart How's it going?
__Raj Good. Sheldon's out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn't like.
__Stuart Oh, how is it?
__Penny Disgusting. Do not tell him.
__Leonard What do you guys want to do tonight?
__Amy I don't know.
__Bernadette Well, I told Howie if I wasn't busy, I'd spend the night at his mom's. So for God's sake, think of something.
__Raj Stuart? Are you okay?
__Stuart No, I don't feel so…
__Leonard Oh, my God, Stuart?
__Penny Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!
__Raj Stuart?
__Leonard Calling 911.
__Raj Well, it's too late.
__Leonard What do you mean it's too late?
__Raj He's been murdered by someone in this room.
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Leonard Oh, come on.
__Raj Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
__Amy I'm leaving.
__Raj You can't leave. You're a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
__Amy Yeah, it's Bloom.
__Penny Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
__Stuart What do you think I was gonna do at home?
__Raj Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?
__Penny You're right, I'm sorry. Sounds like fun.
__Raj Thank you.
__Penny That kind of actress. This sucks.
__Leonard Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that's great. It's not sad, it's great.
__Amy I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
__Raj Actually, you're all just gonna be yourselves.
__Amy Oh, ugh.
__Bernadette All right, if I'm doing this, I'm playing to win, so just to be clear, if we're ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?
__Raj Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.
__Bernadette What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?
__Raj Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
__Amy According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.
__Raj Great, everyone's a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.
__Penny Got it. Hey, who's the murderer?
__Raj Any question but that.
__Penny Sorry. Hey, who's not the murderer?
__Stuart Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?
__Bernadette What do you care? You're dead.
__Stuart Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.
__Howard Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
__Sheldon It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz?
__Howard We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed. We should bring something.
__Sheldon I already am. I'm bringing the gift of knowledge.
__Howard Oh, boy.
__Sheldon Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.
__Howard I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
__Raj I can't tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
__Penny Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.
__Amy Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.
__Leonard Oh, no, no. That's Clarence Darrow. It's from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.
__Raj Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.
__Penny Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?
__Bernadette I didn't know you were fat.
__Raj Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn't help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.
__Amy That is so sweet.
__Leonard I've seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.
__Raj No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.
__Bernadette Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.
__Amy What's it for?
__Bernadette For a cup of coffee. But it's dated 20 years from now.
__Raj From the future? How fun and imaginative.
__Leonard So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?
__Raj Correct.
__Leonard Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he's just ripping off Terminator?
__Raj Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?
__Leonard Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?
__Penny I'm gonna need another clue.
__Sheldon But if we show up and you're holding them, she'll think they're only from you.
__Howard They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
__Howard What's wrong?
__Sheldon Nothing.
__Howard What? Sheldon, tell me what's going on.
__Sheldon I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
__Sheldon I'm not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it's like to see your mother ravaging someone?
__Howard Does a brisket count? I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough. But didn't she know we were coming?
__Sheldon No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
__Howard Well, did she see you in the window?
__Sheldon No.
__Howard Then don't say anything.
__Sheldon I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don't tell her how disappointed I am, and that I'll never forgive her?
__Howard Well, don't do it on the phone.
__Sheldon No, I'm just going to tell her I'm coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.
__Howard That's some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.
__Sheldon Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.
__Howard Look, she's a grown woman. And, and your dad's been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.
__Sheldon I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.
__Penny Well, my beer isn't flat and my rack's not saggy. So far, the future's great.
__Stuart Hey, can I go to the bathroom?
__Raj Fine, just try not to look too alive.
__Stuart That's my jam.
__Bernadette So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?
__Amy But why?
__Raj Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
__Amy Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart's comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.
__Penny Hey, I'm a famous actress living in London.
__Leonard Hmm, I'm a professor at Stanford.
__Penny Hmm.
__Bernadette So I guess you two are making it work long distance.
__Raj Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.
__Amy What does your card say, Bernadette?
__Leonard Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we'd really drift apart if we both became successful?
__Penny Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.
__Leonard But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.
__Penny Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn't need the money.
__Leonard Well, you don't go into science for the money.
__Bernadette Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.
__Penny So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?
__Amy Dun, dun, dun. He started it.
__Raj Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you're an actress, you're a professor and you have three beautiful kids.
__Leonard Great.
__Penny Really? You think I'm putting this body through three kids?
__Howard Good luck.
__Sheldon You, aren't you gonna come with me?
__Howard While you confront your mother about her sex life? I'd rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
__Sheldon Mother?  Mother?  Mother?
__Mrs Cooper Shelly, I'm so glad you're here.
__Mrs Cooper What are you talking about?
__Sheldon Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.
__Mrs Cooper That's not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I'm sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.
__Sheldon Who was he?
__Mrs Cooper His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.
__Sheldon How long have you been involved with him?
__Mrs Cooper A few months.
__Sheldon And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?
__Mrs Cooper That is no way to speak to your mother.
__Sheldon Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas.
__Mrs Cooper I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.
__Sheldon Or what?
__Mrs Cooper Or I will send you to your room.
__Sheldon That's ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
__Sheldon But I occupy the moral high ground.
__Mrs Cooper Go to your room.
__Mrs Go to your room!
__Leonard In a minute. I don't understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.
__Penny Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I'm not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.
__Amy I'm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
__Leonard Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
__Amy Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.
__Penny In 20 years, who knows what'll happen with any of us?
__Stuart I think you and Leonard will be together.
__Penny You do?
__Stuart Yeah. I think you're the best couple I know.
__Leonard Aw.
__Penny That's so sweet.
__Bernadette What the hell?
__Amy Excuse me?
__Penny Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?
__Stuart Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don't know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.
__Penny Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.
__Raj Oh, come on.
__Bernadette Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.
__Sheldon Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
__Howard That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn't go smoothly with your mom.
__Sheldon No. I'm not sure how we're going to get past this.
__Howard You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.
__Sheldon Howard, we've all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.
__Howard I'm talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
__Sheldon I didn't know she did.
__Howard Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.
__Sheldon What did you do?
__Howard Well, let's just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she's basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.
__Howard All I'm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom's happiness.
__Sheldon You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
__Howard And the healing begins.
__Mrs Cooper Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?
__Sheldon I am.
__Mrs Cooper Shelly, I'm sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.
__Sheldon I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn't this contradict all the religious rules you've been espousing your whole life?
__Mrs Cooper You're right, it does, and it's something that I'm struggling with these days.
__Sheldon Then why are you doing it?
__Mrs Cooper Because I'm not perfect, Shelly. And that man's booty is.
__Sheldon Well, this is confusing for me. But I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I'll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.
__Mrs Cooper That is very Christian of you.
__Sheldon Mother, if you're going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it's not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.
__Mrs Cooper How old do you think I am?
__Sheldon My point is that you're going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you're going to need a stronger friend named latex.
__Mrs Cooper Are you having the sex talk with me?
__Sheldon Well, someone has to.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, dear Lord.
__Sheldon No, don't look to Him. He's mad at you right now.
__Raj I'm not pouting, I'm brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.
__Amy It actually was kind of fun.
__Raj You're just saying that.
__Amy Yeah.
__Bernadette I liked the time travel element.
__Raj Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
__Leonard It was. By Terminator.
__Bernadette Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.
__Penny Definitely.
__Leonard Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we're friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let's all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.
__Bernadette Aw.
__Penny I love it.
__Leonard Putting it in my phone right now.
__Penny Yeah, me, too.
__Stuart My phone doesn't have a calendar. So I'll just write it on my hand.
__Raj And it's done.
__Penny Yup, we're all in.
__Leonard All right, I'll see you guys in 20 years.
__Leonard If only there were a solution to that.
__Sheldon Seriously. I feel like I've got a fish tank in my pelvis.
__Leonard So go to the bathroom.
__Sheldon I can't.
__Leonard Why not?
__Sheldon Because I'm trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why'd I say that?
__Leonard Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?
__Sheldon I'm not being stupid. I'm employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.
__Leonard Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Hey. Oh, how'd the audition go?
__Penny I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.
__Leonard Oh, that's great.
__Penny I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.
__Sheldon Here come the waterworks.
__Leonard Aren't you gonna ask?
__Penny What is this, my first day?
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Yeah, sure.
__Amy Of course.
__Bernadette Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.
__Amy I'm sure it's lovable.
__Penny I'm gonna go with monster. What do you got?
__Bernadette Well, there's this lady in our office who's retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.
__Amy Okay.
__Bernadette But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
__Penny I'm liking my odds here.
__Bernadette So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who's clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”
__Penny No.
__Bernadette “LOL.” Smiley face.
__Amy Oh, my gosh.
__Bernadette “P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”
__Penny Oh. Why didn't I put money on this?  Hey, that's my agent. If I got the part, it's still the second best thing I've heard all day. Hello?
__Bernadette Am I a terrible person?
__Amy No. No, it was a mistake.
__Bernadette Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
__Amy Now I think you're flirting with the line. Good news?
__Penny No, I didn't get it.
__Bernadette I'm so sorry.
__Amy You'll get offered something soon.
__Bernadette Are you gonna take it?
__Penny I don't know what to do.
__Amy Maybe you'll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?
__Emily Yeah.
__Raj I, I don't know if you remember me.
__Emily From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?
__Raj Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I'm sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.
__Emily Uh, don't worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you're not the weirdest guy I've met off the Internet.
__Raj Well, give me a chance, you don't even know me.
__Emily All right, here's your chance.
__Raj Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I'm not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.
__Amy Can you get the butter, please?
__Sheldon You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I've had to use Leonard.
__Amy Then get the other one. Pass the butter.
__Sheldon Get? Hang on. I don't feel like you're taking this dilemma seriously.
__Amy Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.
__Sheldon Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.
__Amy No way.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, it's true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.
__Amy Well, you wouldn't want your gaming system to overheat.
__Sheldon No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.
__Amy Included?
__Sheldon Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.
__Amy Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?
__Sheldon See? That's what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.
__Amy Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who's they?
__Sheldon Xbox.
__Sheldon No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.
__Amy This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?
__ Sheldon You see? I don't know. What should I do?
__ Please pass the butter!
__Leonard Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it's still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.
__Penny Okay.  Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?
__Leonard Well, for starters, I wouldn't eat the bananas.
__Penny No, come on. This is serious.
__Leonard Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?
__Penny Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
__Leonard What does your agent think?
__Leonard You know what, why don't you just do it? You'll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?
__Penny Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.
__Leonard Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?
__Penny Both of us.
__Leonard So it's a family film.
__Amy You're welcome.
__Sheldon Good night.
__Amy Uh, it's date night. Aren't you, uh, forgetting something?
__Sheldon Oh, of course.  Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Well, they do.
__Leonard So, are you gonna see her again?
__Penny Okay, like what? Show me.
__Raj I can't do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
__Leonard You have my blessing. Go for it.
__Raj Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.
__Penny Oh, that's sad.
__Raj It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.
__Penny Wow.
__Leonard Okay, that's enough.
__Sheldon Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?
__Raj Uh, Xbox One.
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny Huh?
__Sheldon Leonard?
__Leonard PS4.
__Sheldon Wolowitz?
__Howard Both great.
__Sheldon Bernadette?
__Bernadette I like the Wii.
__Sheldon Thanks, Grandma.
__Raj Oh, my goodness.
__Leonard What's up?
__Raj I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.
__Leonard Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.
__Penny Really?
__Leonard Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.
__Howard Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.
__Raj I can't date two women at once. Zero women, that's my sweet spot.
__Penny Unless you're sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn't a big deal.
__Raj But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?
__Howard and Bernadette Yes.
__Bernadette What do you mean, yes?
__Howard What do you mean, yes?
__Bernadette Were you seeing other women when we started dating?
__Howard No. Were you seeing other men?
__Bernadette No.
__Leonard Were you seeing other men?
__Penny No.
__Leonard Aren't you gonna ask me?
__Wil Wheaton Yeah, happy to help. So, what's going on?
__Penny Well, I'm having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don't know if I should take it.
__Wil Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I've been embarrassed by.
__Penny I wouldn't exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.
__Wil I wasn't.
__Penny Me, either.
__Leonard So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?
__Wil Well, it's tricky. You want to take projects that you're excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you're on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.
__Penny Yeah, beam me up. I love it.
__Wil Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.
__Penny That's what I'm afraid of.
__Wil So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.
__Leonard Sounds rough.
__Wil I'm telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don't get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can't even get out of bed.
__Leonard Okay, this was helpful.
__Raj Oh, no.
__Bernadette The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.
__Howard Were you like this when I married you?
__Raj Did he help you make a decision about the movie?
__Penny No. Did you figure out what you're gonna do about the two girls?
__Raj As a matter of fact, I did. I've spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I'm gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer's going to be yes.
__Howard He's gonna die alone, right?
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny Yes.
__Bernadette Yes.
__Sheldon You know, I'm proud of me, too. I've done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I've arrived at the rock-solid certainty I've made the right choice.
__Amy Well, that's got to be a good feeling.
__Sheldon Oh, it is. Although.
__Amy Oh, crap.
__Sheldon I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.
__Amy You were just a little kid.
__Sheldon Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.
__Amy How old were you then?
__Sheldon Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.
__Amy What's a Zune?
__Sheldon Yeah, exactly. It's an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.
__Amy No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it's good. You did the research.
__Sheldon But what if I'm wrong?
__Amy You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?
__Sheldon You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.
__Amy Then I'll buy you a new entertainment centre.
__Sheldon Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?
__Amy How about this? I've heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you'll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.
__Sheldon Interesting.
__Amy So, heads it's PS4, tails it's Xbox One.
__Sheldon All right, I'll try.
__Amy What is it?
__Sheldon A quarter.
__Amy Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.
__Emily Thanks. I love that jacket.
__Raj Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I'm sorry. I can't do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I'm seeing her Saturday, And I'm glad you like it, it's from J. Crew.
__Emily I don't understand.
__Raj My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I'm being deceitful.
__Emily Are you getting back together with her?
__Raj No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?
__Emily Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let's do this. How serious were you two?
__Raj Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.
__Emily Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?
__Raj Yeah.
__Emily That's kind of adorable.
__Raj Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I've said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.
__Emily I'm still here.
__Raj Yeah, but now you make me wonder what's wrong with you.
__Emily We just met. You don't need to tell me about other people you're seeing.
__Raj Really? Because I'm dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.
__Amy I can't feel my legs.
__Store assistant Oh, I'm sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.
__Sheldon But I haven't decided yet.
__Store assistant You'll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.
__Amy Let's get you some food. You, You'll feel better after you eat.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Amy What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?
__Sheldon I don't know. Hey, look, a quarter.
__Penny Great. Not like regret at all.
__Wil Penny? We're working together. Awesome.
__Raj I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
__Howard Only without the sex.
__Raj Yeah, literally, none of it.
__Leonard What do you think about it, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Meh.
__Raj Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?
__Sheldon Maybe it's because I'm not an elitist. What I'd like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who's looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?
__Leonard Oh, my God, you're jealous.
__Sheldon Why would I be jealous?
__Leonard Oh, I don't know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you've been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you're no closer to proving it than when you started.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, I've had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.
__Barry Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.
__Sheldon Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
__Barry No, but they did find evidence that you'll bewieve anything.
__Sheldon Why would you do that? You're a string theorist as well.
__Sheldon Do you think he's right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
__Howard Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon I couldn't sleep.
__Penny I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
__Sheldon No, that's not it.
__Penny Is something bothering you?
__Sheldon Yes, but you wouldn't understand.
__Penny Oh, come on, try me.
__Sheldon All right. I've devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I've got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.
__Penny Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it's like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.
__Sheldon You mean your acting career?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Your failed attempt to go back to college?
__Penny No. I'm saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it's like to be in one and realize it's never gonna turn out the way you want.
__Sheldon I said Leonard, you said no.
__Penny I'm talking about other guys.
__Sheldon Okay. Well, what do you do?
__Penny You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
__Sheldon I don't know if I can do that.
__Penny I know it's hard, honey, but in the end, that's how you grow.
__Leonard Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?
__Sheldon Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
__Raj Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn't the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.
__Howard And?
__Raj She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily's the best. Why can't you
__ be more like Emily? Those feelings became less mixed.
__ Women. Who knows what'll set 'em off?
__Raj At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
__Howard I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.
__Raj Why the rush? She isn't going anywhere.
__Howard She is. But I like that attitude.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?
__Raj You're really going to do this?
__Sheldon I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I'm going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.
__Howard You're reading Cosmo?
__Sheldon Yes. As it turns out, there's an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.
__Howard What's this?
__Sheldon Oh, that's just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?
__Sheldon It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.
__Raj It's going to be okay.
__Sheldon I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can't keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.
__Howard So, you and Emily still together?
__Raj Oh, okay, great. But if we're really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.
__Howard Like when it turns out she's made of rubber, I don't say anything?
__Raj She's very real.
__Howard Oh, that's what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.
__Raj See? This is exactly the kind of thing I'm worried about you saying in front of her.
__Raj You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
__Howard You got it.
__Raj No jokes about the year I took ballet.
__Howard You took ballet?
__Raj God, you never listen.
__Sheldon The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
__Leonard What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?
__Penny Oh my God, I do look like that.
__Sheldon You stop it.
__Penny So, how do you want me to cut it?
__Sheldon Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?
__Leonard So, business in the front, science in the back.
__Penny Or I don't cut it and maybe just style it a little.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm in your hands. Do a good job and I'll tell you Cosmo's ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.
__Penny Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
__Leonard That doesn't work any more. He just thinks I'm taking him to the doctor. So, now that you're no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?
__Sheldon Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.
__Penny Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn't really understand it.
__Sheldon Don't feel bad. Neither does he.
__Penny Okay, what do you think?
__Sheldon Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?
__Leonard It actually looks good, Sheldon.
__Penny Doesn't it?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I'd be the dreamy one and the smart one.
__Amy Sorry I'm late. What did you do?
__Penny I gave him a new look. It's cute, huh?
__Amy Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem. I don't need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.
__Sheldon She's right. I'm too hot.
__Howard Me, too. I just hope he doesn't blow it.
__Bernadette Why would you say that?
__Howard Because he's Raj, that's his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don't want it to happen, but odds are he's gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.
__Bernadette How?
__Howard In a bad way, very bad.
__Raj Hey, guys.
__Howard Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.
__Raj Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.
__Emily Nice to meet you.
__Bernadette Hi.
__Emily Have we met before?
__Howard Uh, no. I, I don't, I don't think so.
__Emily You sure? You look familiar.
__Howard Well, you sure don't. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.
__Emily Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?
__Howard That must be it.
__Raj Since when do you go to spin class?
__Howard Wow. Now who doesn't listen?
__Sheldon Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children's party while I was in Texas?
__Penny Wait. What's wrong with geology?
__Sheldon Let me put this in a way you'll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren't real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.
__Sheldon Have you considered studying standard model physics?
__Sheldon You want me to give up string theory for something that's less advanced? You know, why don't you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?
__Penny Like you could get a brown bear.
__Leonard Hey, I've got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don't know.
__Amy Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
__Sheldon Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I'd get a tramp stamp.
__Leonard What about loop quantum gravity?
__Sheldon Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity's positively loopy.
__Penny Who's the duchess?
__Leonard One of the people that lives in his head.
__Leonard Well, if he does, I'll see if my bear has a friend.
__Penny Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don't you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
__Sheldon That's actually not bad advice. You know, I didn't seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.
__Amy How does that happen?
__Sheldon A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
__Penny Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?
__Sheldon Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that's been predigested by a fungus?
__Penny And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
__Emily I'm a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.
__Raj Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone's skin's about to be softer than ever.
__Emily This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.
__Raj Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that's where you saw him.
__Emily Wow. That's amazing. What was that like?
__Howard It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you're…
__Emily Oh, my God, I remember.
__Howard Can I finish my astronaut story?
__Emily It was four years ago.
__Howard Please don't say it.
__Emily We were set up on a blind date.
__Howard Please don't say it.
__Emily You came to my apartment.
__Howard You're saying it.
__Raj Wh, what happened?
__Bernadette Yeah, what happened?
__Howard Okay, I'll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.
__Bernadette Please don't say it.
__Howard One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.
__Emily You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.
__Howard I'm sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn't have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.
__Emily Right, just water.
__Howard Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I'm glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.
__Emily It's fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.
__Raj Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
__Howard Yeah, yeah, I get it.
__Bernadette Howie.
__Howard Well, hey, it's not like cotton candy comes out of you.
__Sheldon No more than Penny.
__Amy That's what I'm saying.
__Sheldon Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Empty room.  Empty room.  Empty room. If somebody says come in, I'm gonna freak out.
__Emily I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.
__Bernadette You're kidding, right?
__Raj She's scary, but it's a cute scary.
__Howard Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I'd really appreciate it if we could move on.
__Bernadette Howie, we moved on a long time ago.
__Howard I'm just saying…
__Bernadette We moved on.
__Howard Okay. Fine.
__Bernadette How's your soup?
__Howard Ah, it's all right. They could've filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.
__Bernadette Where are you going?
__Howard I need some fresh air.
__Emily Been there.
__Sheldon Not so good.
__Leonard Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
__Sheldon It's not my friend. Nothing happened.
__Leonard I don't know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord. Where's Amy?
__Leonard After she put you to bed, she went home.
__Sheldon Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.
__Sheldon Hawkman. It's your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn't pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.
__Sheldon Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
__Howard Ugh. Me, too. What happened?
__Sheldon I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
__Howard I wouldn't worry about it. He's got a pretty good sense of humour.
__Sheldon Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?
__Howard Oh, well, turns out I'd already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.
__Barry Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.
__Howard Get out of here, Barry.
__Barry Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.
__Sheldon Clogzilla. That's pretty funny. I don't think that's gonna pass.
__Sheldon It's me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together.
__Answerphone Next message.
__Sheldon Do you know what's great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That's fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.
__Answerphone Next message.
__Sheldon Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.
__Answerphone Next message.
__Sheldon Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I'm you. Get it?
__Sheldon Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you're mad at me. I'm so sorry. Beep bop boop bop.
__Answerphone Next message.
__Sheldon Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That's even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?
__Stephen Hawking What a jackass.
__Leonard Okay.
__Penny But I realize they're gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it's important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.
__Leonard It's sweet that he thinks there's a story.
__Penny Oh, and there's not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.
__Sheldon Leonard, I could use your assistance.
__Leonard Sure. What's up?
__Sheldon Well, now that I've given up string theory, I'm struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?
__Leonard Huh, well, I think there's some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.
__Penny Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?
__Sheldon It is just so frustrating.
__Penny ‘Cause you're trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.
__Leonard Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?
__Leonard You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.
__Penny Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?
__Sheldon All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.
__Leonard Great, what do you want to do?
__Sheldon I don't know. What do you want to do?
__Penny I don't know. What do you want to do?
__Leonard I'm starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard What can we do that's different?
__Penny What can we do that's free?
__Sheldon Oh, got it. We order a pizza.
__Penny Are you kidding? That's what you always do. Think harder.
__Sheldon You're right. You're right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I'll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There's a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.
__Penny Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.
__Leonard You know what? Why don't we just ease into this. Let, let's go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.
__Sheldon Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon All right.
__Leonard Raj and Howard are at Howard's mom's, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?
__Penny No. Bernadette's working late.
__Sheldon Amy's sick.
__Leonard Aw. What's wrong with her?
__Sheldon Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.
__Leonard That's not what I meant.
__Sheldon Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?
__Leonard What ails her?
__Sheldon Oh. Who knows?
__Penny Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.
__Raj No problem. How's your mom feeling?
__Howard Okay, but she'd feel better if she took her medicine.
__Raj You know, when Cinnamon won't take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.
__Howard Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?
__Raj I was thinking we could watch a DVD.
__Howard Well, my mom doesn't have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.
__Raj Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?
__Howard A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.
__Raj I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.
__Howard That's actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.
__Raj Uh, so, you'll watch it?
__Howard Sure.
__Raj You're a good friend. I owe you one.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard. Help me get out of the tub.
__Raj Not that one.
__Penny Yep.
__Sheldon Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won't Stop Coming Up Friday.
__Leonard Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?
__Sheldon Fusion and Asians? I'm trying not to think about science.
__Penny What the hell? What? She's not working late.
__Sheldon And Amy doesn't look sick.
__Penny Why would they lie to us?
__Sheldon That's a good question.  Amy and Bernadette.  Amy and Bernadette.  Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?
__Howard I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I'm one slippery horror ahead of you.
__Raj You're a good son. I don't know how you do it.
__Howard Beach blankets, my friend, it's all about beach blankets.
__Raj All right, let's get this over with. Ew, it's got someone's hair on it.
__Howard Oh, yeah, you're gonna do great with this movie.
__Sheldon And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.
__Amy I'm sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.
__Bernadette We kind of just wanted one night where we didn't have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.
__Amy But none of that means we don't love you.
__Penny I haven't been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
__Penny Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Where are we going?
__Penny We're gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you're gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I'm gonna complain about my movie, and we're gonna support each other because that's what friends do.
__Sheldon Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I'd probably go with dark matter because…
__Sheldon I don't understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.
__Penny It's fusion.
__Sheldon My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
__Penny Think I've been complaining too much about the movie?
__Sheldon Not at all.
__Penny Thank you.
__Sheldon But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.
__Penny Hey, I don't understand why you're not upset with Amy.
__Sheldon I am. So much so that I'm gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.
__Howard And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.
__Raj On the bright side, she didn't even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there's something psychologically wrong with her?
__Howard What difference does it make?
__Raj What do you mean?
__Howard Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend's body parts and you'd still go out with her.
__Raj I do like that the ex-boyfriend's out of the picture.
__Bernadette I'd tell you what I do with Howard, but I don't think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.
__Leonard He'd probably give you homework.
__Amy Did you lie to Howard about tonight?
__Bernadette Of course.
__Amy And you don't feel guilty about it?
__Bernadette Between Penny's gorilla movie and Howard's gorilla mother, I had no choice.
__Leonard Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don't lie to her.
__Bernadette Oh, we know you don't lie to her.
__Penny Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.
__Sheldon This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there's a tiny Chihuahua in here.
__Penny Fine, I'll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that's a good one.
__Sheldon No, it's not.
__Penny How is that not good?
__Sheldon Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You'd never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.
__Penny Uh, since you're paying for dinner, I'll let that slide. Open yours.
__Sheldon Have you ever paid for a meal?
__Penny Not with money. Read.
__Sheldon Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
__Raj I'm just gonna say it. That's not okay. Why can't I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?
__Howard Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music.  Hey, Penny. What's up? No, Bernie's working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.
__Raj What?
__Howard I'm having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.
__Sheldon You can't be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I'd follow Leonard on Instagram.
__Penny No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.
__Sheldon Oh. That's a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.
__Leonard You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?
__Amy I know, it's weird, right?
__Leonard Yeah. We should do it more often.
__Amy Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.
__Leonard Ah, it's Penny.
__Amy Is she still mad?
__Leonard Oh, doesn't seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.
__Amy A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.
__Leonard Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She's gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn't normally do.
__Amy Because she has sex with you.
__Leonard Yeah, she does.
__Amy Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.
__Leonard Really?
__Amy I mean, not in a romantic way. It's just, she really has some sort of connection with him.
__Leonard Well, well they've known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.
__Amy Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they're friends. I just wish he'd be that comfortable around me already.
__Leonard Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.
__Amy Really? What did you do?
__Leonard Something terrible in a former life? I don't know.
__Bernadette I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she's getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.
__Penny All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.
__Sheldon Okay, I just did. What was it?
__Penny Oh, for God's sake. Look, he's a physicist who's trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.
__Sheldon For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.
__Penny Okay, I can answer that one, I'll be bored.
__Psychic All right, why don't we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there's a woman in your life you're having problems with.
__Sheldon That's an easy guess. I'm clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.
__Psychic Yes, you clearly are. But I'm seeing a specific woman that you're in a romantic relationship with.
__Penny Oh, oh, here we go.
__Psychic Does she have dark hair?
__Penny Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.
__Sheldon The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.
__Psychic Does she work in a similar field to you?
__Sheldon Ha. The opposite. She's a neurobiologist, and I'm a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.
__Psychic They're telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.
__Penny Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?
__Psychic He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.
__Penny Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.
__Psychic Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.
__Sheldon You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it's truly deserved. This is malarkey.
__Penny Wow, you really struck a nerve. I've never heard him use the M word before.
__Emily Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.
__Raj Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren't my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.
__Emily Okay.
__Raj And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.
__Emily I wonder that, too.
__Raj Then, why do you watch these things?
__Emily Can I tell you something without you judging me?
__Raj Sure.
__Emily They kind of turn me on.
__Raj And play.
__Sheldon And how do you propose to do that?  Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don't know where you're going with this.
__Penny What? That's a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?
__Howard No. Don't be ridiculous. That's Wookiee Life Day.
__Penny So, when is it?
__Leonard Uh, well, it's not May the fifth, and it's not May the third. It's May the fourth.
__Sheldon Get it?
__Raj May the fourth be with you?
__Leonard May the force be with you. Get it?
__Penny Oh, no. This face wasn't because I didn't get it.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Hey, you got a second?
__Sheldon Yes. Actually, I'm glad you're here. I'm working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I'm worried an hour won't be enough time.
__Leonard Sheldon, I've got some bad news.
__Sheldon What is it?
__Leonard I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
__Sheldon Professor Proton is dead?
__Leonard Sorry, buddy.
__Sheldon What are you doing?
__Leonard Comforting you?
__Sheldon Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren't.
__Leonard Anyway, the, the funeral's on Sunday.
__Sheldon But, that's Star Wars Day.
__Leonard Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.
__Sheldon I'm fine.
__Amy Watching your old friend?
__Sheldon Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It's such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.
__Amy Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm not going to the funeral.
__Amy Why not?
__Sheldon All those people blowing their noses. You can't tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I'll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.
__Amy Are you sure you don't want to go say good-bye?
__Sheldon Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.
__Amy And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you've seen hundreds of times isn't?
__Sheldon If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.
__Raj Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.
__Penny Okay.
__Raj Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar is open for business.
__Penny No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.
__Howard You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?
__Raj And if you're not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
__Penny Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?
__Raj Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?
__Sheldon Uh, no, thank you.
__Howard You're being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
__Sheldon I'm fine.
__Penny Sweetie, are you sure you don't want to come with us to the funeral?
__Sheldon Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there's nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?
__Sheldon Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I'm sure he didn't care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he'd say enjoy Star Wars Day.
__Leonard He was 84, he'd say where's my pudding?
__Raj Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.
__Penny Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.
__Bernadette Me, too. Although, it might've been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.
__Amy No, it combines two of Sheldon's favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.
__Bernadette Well, anyway, it'll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn't think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.
__Amy Okay, let's get the fondant and start decorating.
__Bernadette This is pretty cool. You don't see too many spherical cakes.
__Amy I wonder why that is.
__Leonard Hmm?
__Penny I've never been to a funeral before.
__Leonard Really?
__Penny I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn't have a funeral, we had a barbecue.
__Leonard Yeah, we won't be eating Arthur tonight.
__Penny I didn't know him very well, but I still really liked him. It's weird that he's just gone.
__Leonard I know.
__Penny I feel like I want to cry.
__Leonard Oh that's, that's fine. Go ahead.
__Penny I can't do it with you staring at me.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Penny No, I'm dry. You're a big crybaby, you start, I'll join in.
__Leonard I am not a crybaby.
__Penny Toy Story 3?
__Leonard The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.
__Penny It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
__Leonard I got your back.
__Penny Yeah.
__Raj Ugh, let's get this over with.
__Howard Since we all agree Episode I isn't our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.
__Sheldon Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.
__Raj You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.
__Howard Okay, so you'd lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.
__Sheldon Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
__Raj It was just a suggestion.
__Sheldon Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don't we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.
__Howard I think he's taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.
__Raj Should we try to console him?
__Howard Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?
__Raj By staying here and watching the movie.
__Howard That's what good friends would do.
__Raj Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.
__Howard Me, too.
__Raj Maybe we should see how he's doing.
__Howard Yeah.
__Raj But after the cantina scene.
__Howard Obviously.
__Arthur You never heard it that time.
__Sheldon Arthur. I thought you were dead.
__Arthur I am. Oh, it, it's fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I've gone without running into a men's room in, in, in years.
__Sheldon Why are you here?
__Arthur I don't know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.
__Sheldon I know why. You've come to me because you're my Obi-Wan.
__Arthur I'm, I'm not, I'm not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?
__Sheldon Wow. Uh, you're dead, so I'm going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.
__Arthur Well, that, that clears that up.
__Sheldon You must be here to give me advice.
__Arthur Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.
__Sheldon Those are your Jedi robes.
__Arthur Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?
__Sheldon Be careful with that.
__Arthur Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I'm, uh, I'm going to need a Band-Aid.
__Penny Well, I don't want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.
__Leonard Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.
__Penny You think about dying?
__Leonard Mm. Well, I think more about if I'd have any regrets.
__Penny What would you regret?
__Leonard Mm, you know, that I didn't travel more, take more risks, learn another language.
__Penny You know Klingon.
__Leonard That's true.
__Penny No, I meant that as a regret.
__Leonard I just thought of one more.
__Penny What's that?
__Leonard I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
__Penny Well, it just wasn't the right time.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
__Leonard What?
__Penny I know that face. That's your propose face.
__Leonard I was not gonna propose. It's already two to one.
__Penny What's two to one?
__Leonard I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.
__Penny Oh, my. It's not a contest.
__Leonard I don't know what you're upset about. I'm the one who's losing.
__Penny Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?
__Leonard Yeah, I think I would.
__Penny Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?
__Leonard Hmm.
__Penny No, don't you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.
__Leonard It's just such a big decision. I don't want to have any regrets.
__Bernadette No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn't see it.
__Amy I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.
__Bernadette Not me. I got into science 'cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.
__Amy That's cute.
__Bernadette Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?
__Amy Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.
__Bernadette Girl Sprouts?
__Amy My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn't want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
__Amy Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.
__Penny This isn't funny anymore. Just say no so we're done with this. Will you marry me or not?
__Leonard Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?
__Penny No.
__Leonard Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That's two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.
__Penny You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.
__Leonard Hey. Penny, don't get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…
__Sheldon This is the swampland of Dagobah. It's where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.
__Arthur Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.
__Sheldon When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?
__Arthur Um, always, get, get a prenup.
__Sheldon That's it? I thought there'd be more of a reason why you're here.
__Arthur Well, why, why do you think I'm here?
__Sheldon I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
__Arthur Is, is this the, the first time you've lost, you know, someone close to you?
__Sheldon Oh, no. No. I've already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.
__Arthur Yeah, I've, I've outlived a few of my doctors, too.
__Sheldon Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.
__Sheldon And now you're gone, too. It's like all the men I've looked up to have gone away.
__Arthur Well, you know, it's, it's okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.
__Sheldon But I do appreciate them.
__Arthur Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon.
__Sheldon I'm okay. How was the funeral?
__Leonard It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur's son is a high school sci…?  Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?
__Sheldon I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.
__Leonard Sheldon, that, that'll take us all night.
__Sheldon That's true. Oh, it's a good thing I had a nap.
__Leonard At least they toned him down in the second one.
__Penny Yeah, he is pretty stupid.
__Raj Hey, we can say it. You can't.
__Amy Hey, guys.
__Bernadette Happy Star Wars Day.
__Sheldon Wow. A Death Star cake.
__Amy Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.
__Bernadette And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.
__Howard Well, you didn't miss anything. We just started over.
__Bernadette Son of a bitch.
__Arthur Yeah, apparently, um, I'm here whenever, when, whenever you need me.
__Sheldon That's nice.
__Arthur May, maybe for you.
__Sheldon Why do I need you now?
__Arthur Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you're, you're dreaming you're watching Star Wars.
__Sheldon So?
__Arthur I mean, don't, don't you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you're spending your limited time on Earth?
__Sheldon Not at all.
__Arthur Okay, good luck to you.
__Howard Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.
__Raj Please hurry.
__Mrs Wolowitz I don't need a treadmill.
__Howard The doctor says you need to get exercise.
__Mrs Wolowitz I get plenty of exercise.
__Howard Crushing my will to live isn't exercise.
__Raj If she isn't gonna use it, then why are we doing this?
__Howard She'll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.
__Bernadette We set it up in Howie's old room.
__Raj Do you know how to set it up?
__Howard Please, I'm an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out.
__Mrs Wolowitz Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.
__Amy Should we do something for her?
__Sheldon I know. Let's go see the new Spider-Man movie.
__Amy Sheldon, we're talking about your friend's mother. She got hurt.
__Sheldon I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It's called reading the room, Amy.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Hey, how were things on the set?
__Penny Uh, pretty good, actually.
__Raj So the movie's not as bad as you thought?
__Penny Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I'm just gonna go in every day and give it my all.
__Amy Good for you.
__Penny Thanks. There's no reason why I shouldn't be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone's ever seen.
__Leonard I don't know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler's List is tough to beat.
__Sheldon Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.
__Leonard It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.
__Sheldon I know.
__Bernadette Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
__Howard You mean a forklift?
__Bernadette Howie.
__Howard I'm sorry. I just can't deal with this right now.
__Bernadette Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?
__Howard Bernie, she's gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?
__Bernadette I would do it for my mother.
__Howard Yeah, of course you would, you're a loving person. I'm what my people would call a putz.
__Bernadette Look, I'm not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?
__Howard We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who's used to suffering and unpleasant smells.
__Bernadette You'd hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That's so cruel.
__Howard Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.
__Mrs Wolowitz I need to tinkle.
__Howard Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?
__Bernadette You are a putz.
__Howard As advertised.
__Raj Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren't you gonna get 3-D glasses?
__Sheldon I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
__Raj Is that a real thing?
__Sheldon Well, until they invent nose condoms, I'm not finding out.
__Raj Emily, Hey.
__Emily Oh, hey, Raj.
__Raj Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.
__Sheldon Oh, yes, you're the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?
__Emily Um, you know what? I better go. My movie's about to start.
__Raj Are you here alone?
__Emily No, not really.
__Raj What do you mean, not really?
__Man Hey, should we get our seats?
__Emily Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I'll call you later.
__Raj Yeah, okay.
__Sheldon That was awkward, right?
__Sheldon Is it because she's dating you but was out with that other fellow?
__Raj Yes.
__Sheldon Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
__Wil Wheaton Please don't shut me out.
__Penny Go away. Just go away.
__Wil I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.
__Penny What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?
__Wil I was trying to save your life.
__Penny Life? What life? Look at me, I'm a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don't know.
__Penny I love you, too. But I'm afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.
__Director And cut. All right. All right, let's set up for the next scene.
__Penny Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.
__Director Let's just move on. No one cares.
__Penny Well, I care. I mean, look, if we're gonna do this, why not try and make it something we're actually proud of?
__Director Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, 'cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn't be in it.
__Leonard Whoa, whoa, hang on. There's no need to insult her.
__Director And who are you?
__Leonard I'm her boyfriend.
__Director Isn't she too hot for you?
__Leonard A little, yeah.
__Director Well, boyfriend, get off my set.
__Penny You can't do that. He's with me.
__Director You know what? You can get off my set, too. You're fired.
__Penny What? You can't fire me. I'm the star. I'm the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.
__Director Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.
__Wil Hey, if you're gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.
__Sheldon Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I've learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don't have all the ingredients to make chai tea.
__Raj You don't have to make me anything.
__Sheldon No, I do. You're upset about Emily and you're Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
__Raj Sorry, I left them in my turban.
__Sheldon Oh, I'll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That's close enough. You know, I'm curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?
__Raj Wouldn't you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
__Sheldon Can't happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
__Raj But you don't have sex with her, either.
__Sheldon Slick, huh?
__Raj To be truthful, Emily and I haven't dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.
__Sheldon Have you had intercourse?
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.
__Howard It's like the world's fattest cuckoo clock.
__Bernadette You know, you're always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it's gonna be like.
__Howard No, it's not.
__Bernadette Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We're even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.
__Howard Maybe you're right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.
__Bernadette I'm just telling you now, if we do have kids, don't expect me to do all the work.
__Howard Hey, I'm a very paternal person. I'd be excellent at taking care of a baby.
__Mrs Wolowitz I'm still hungry.
__Howard I'm coming, you big baby.
__Wil Forget it, man, it's crap. You just move on to the next thing.
__Penny Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say. You used to be famous.
__Wil Hey. I just lost a job for you.
__Penny All right, I'm sorry, you're famous.
__Wil Penny, it's not about being famous. It's about the art. It's about the passion we have for our craft.  I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.
__Penny God, what am I doing with my life?
__Leonard You having second thoughts about acting?
__Penny You were on set, you saw what it was like.
__Leonard Yeah, but it's not always that bad.
__Penny Oh, really?
__Leonard What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?
__Penny It was over a bowling alley.
__Leonard Yeah, but there was ample parking.
__Penny Are you done?
__Leonard And you were so good in the TV commercial.
__Penny It was for haemorrhoid cream.
__Leonard And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
__Penny Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.
__Leonard Come on. How can you be sad when you're going home with all five-foot-six of this?
__Penny Hmm. You think you're five-foot-six, that's funny.
__Sheldon An interesting question. Well, good night.
__Raj What? Don't send me home. I can't be alone right now.
__Sheldon That's your problem. You can't be alone.
__Raj What do you mean?
__Sheldon How many women have you had dates with?
__Raj Eleven.
__Sheldon How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
__Raj Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
__Sheldon Sure.
__Raj I'll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
__Sheldon Well, now do you see the problem?
__Raj Maybe. I, I don't know.It's late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you're saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.
__Sheldon I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it's my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.
__Howard Shh, I just got her to sleep.
__Bernadette Sorry.
__Howard What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.
__Bernadette They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.
__Howard Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?
__Howard A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.
__Bernadette Queen? I've been killing myself here.
__Howard Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I'm nice, I want to take care of people.
__Bernadette I'm glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I'm glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard.
__Howard Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.
__Emily Thanks for letting me come over.
__Raj Of course. Please, come in.
__Emily I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we're okay.
__Raj Uh, look, you and I haven't made any commitments to each other.
__Emily I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he's been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.
__Raj It's okay.
__Emily Really?
__Raj Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that's my issue, not yours.
__Emily Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I'd be pretty upset.
__Raj Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.
__Emily Just so you know, I'm not seeing anyone else.
__Raj Well, me, neither.
__Emily Okay.
__Raj Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?
__Emily Yeah.
__Raj I don't. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
__Emily That's cool.
__Raj It's a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?
__Emily One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.
__Raj It's, uh, been a long time since I've seen a girl's really not her shoulder.
__Emily Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?
__Raj But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.
__Leonard Can I get you anything?
__Penny No. I need to start making some smart decisions.
__Leonard With your career?
__Penny With my life.
__Leonard Like what?
__Penny I don't know. We could get married.
__Leonard Come on, be serious.
__Leonard Why? Because I'm a, a smart decision?
__Penny Well, yeah.
__Leonard So I'm like a bran muffin.
__Penny What? No, that's not what I'm saying.
__Leonard No, it's exactly what you're saying. I'm the boring thing you're choosing because I'm good for you.
__Penny What does it matter? The point is, I'm choosing you.
__Leonard Well, it matters a lot. I don't want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you're excited about even though it could give you diabetes.
__Penny Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.
__Leonard No, no. No, it's too late. I'm your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.
__Penny You know what? Forget it. I never should've brought it up.
__Leonard You know I want to marry you, but you're only doing this because you got fired and you're feeling sorry for yourself.
__Penny Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don't need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.
__Leonard Then what do you need?
__Penny You, you stupid Pop-Tart.
__Leonard Oh. Then I guess I'm in.
__Penny Really? You guess you're in?
__Leonard Not like, I guess I'm in. Like I guess, I'm in!
__Penny Cool.
__Leonard So is that it? Are, are we engaged?
__Penny Yeah, I think so.
__Leonard All right.
__Penny What's wrong?
__Leonard I'm not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.
__Penny Yeah, it kind of does, huh?
__Leonard Oh, I know. This might help.
__Penny Where did you get a ring?
__Leonard I've had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?
__Penny Oh, my God, yes.
__Leonard This would have been so much more romantic if you didn't have monkey hair on your finger.
__Bernadette Last night was a little rough, but I think we're gonna get through this.
__Howard I'm proud of us.
__Bernadette Me, too.
__Mrs Wolowitz Where's my pancakes?!
__Foreign Nurse Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!
__Bernadette You were right.
__Howard Welcome to Team Putz.
__Amy How many is that now?
__Howard Two, and I know what you're thinking, she's eating them.
__Bernadette She's just so impossible, they keep quitting.
__Sheldon So, who's watching her now?
__Howard A bowl full of M&M's with a few Ambien tossed in.
__Raj What up, guys?
__All Hello, hey!
__Leonard Okay. Well, now that everyone's here, Penny and I have some big news. We're engaged.
__ General cheering and congratulations.
__ And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
__ Hey, hey, what the hell?
__Bernadette You guys propose all the time. This never happens.
__Penny You're right! Yay!
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Because you had sex the other night?
__Raj You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn't like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.
__Leonard Hey, buddy.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard You okay?
__Sheldon I just got called into President Siebert's office. The university won't let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They're forcing me to continue with string theory.
__Howard Why?
__Sheldon He said it's why they hired me, it's, it's what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don't want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn't want to, which was look at my stupid face.
__Leonard That's a rude thing to say, out loud.
__Sheldon It's an outrage. Honestly, I'm tempted to leave the university.
__Howard You know, if you're really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.
__Leonard Whatever you do, just don't make any rash decisions.
__Sheldon I don't know. I am really aggravated.
__Raj When I'm feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that's just me.
__Nurse No. Life, it is too short.
__Bernadette I know you've only been here a day and a half, but you're like part of the family. I don't think the service is gonna send any more people.
__Howard Yeah, maybe it's time we just release Ma back into the sea.
__Bernadette That's not helpful.
__Howard Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we're gonna be living here the next few months.
__Bernadette But we have jobs. We can't baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
__Howard Well, what if we use our vacation time?
__Bernadette I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.
__Bernadette Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.
__Leonard Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.
__Mrs Hofstadter I'm listening.
__Leonard Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?
__Mrs Hofstadter No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.
__Leonard I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
__Mrs Hofstadter Would you like for you and me to talk more?
__Leonard You know what? It's probably fine.
__Mrs Hofstadter In any event, while I've had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she's good enough for me.
__Leonard I'm your son. What about the fact that she's good enough for me?
__Leonard Thanks, Mom.
__Mrs Hofstadter Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?
__Leonard Yes, it would.
__Mrs Hofstadter Yeah. Well, you should work on that.
__Amy Atomic magnets?
__Penny Shut up.
__Bernadette Sorry I'm late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.
__Penny You want some wine?
__Bernadette Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You're not just marrying him, you're marrying his family.
__Penny I think Leonard's mom's okay with me.
__Bernadette It doesn't matter if she's okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.
__Amy So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?
__Penny Well, haven't really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I'll move in with him, or he'll move in with me.
__Amy Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.
__Bernadette You're not working. How would you like a job in home health care?
__Penny Not a chance.
__Bernadette Please. I'm desperate.
__Penny No.
__Bernadette I'll pay you anything you want.
__Penny Okay, then, yeah.
__Bernadette I could've ridden a bull longer than that.
__Sheldon I'm writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.
__Leonard Oh. How's it going?
__Sheldon You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I'd be happy to explain it to you in words you'll understand.
__Leonard It's nice that you called them esteemed.
__Sheldon You're right. I'll take that out.
__Leonard So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.
__Sheldon Mm.
__Leonard Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.
__Sheldon Of course. She's spent many nights here, and you're worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.
__Leonard I'm not.
__Sheldon Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.
__Leonard Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.
__Sheldon What do you mean?
__Leonard Well, well, we might want to live together.
__Sheldon Oh, yeah, well, I've already given this some thought, and I'm willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she's made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.
__Leonard That's very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
__Sheldon I don't understand. How could we all live together if I'm not there?
__Leonard Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.
__Sheldon Where are you going to go?
__Leonard I don't know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I'll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I'll take this place, and you can move across the hall.
__Sheldon Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?
__Leonard No, I did not.
__Sheldon Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Well, then, I'm all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?
__Leonard Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.
__Leonard Well, yeah.
__Sheldon Wow.
__Amy They just don't appreciate you.
__Sheldon Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.
__Amy Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.
__Sheldon I have real problems here, Amy. I can't be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.
__Amy You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you're always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you're not there.
__Sheldon Ugh, it's like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.
__Amy You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
__Sheldon Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?
__Amy See? Maybe you'll love living alone.
__Sheldon I don't know. Perhaps.
__Amy And if it turns out you don't, you and I could live together.
__Sheldon You and… oh, sure, and while we're at it, why don't we get engaged, too? Why don't we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?
__Amy Sheldon, it was just a thought.
__Sheldon No. Here's a thought. You're not moving in, Leonard's not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you're supposed to use the powder.
__Amy It tastes the same.
__Sheldon No. The syrup tastes better and I don't like it.
__Leonard Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.
__Penny If you don't like my cooking, why haven't you ever said anything?
__Leonard It's hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
__Penny Sorry. I'll get better.
__Leonard I know you'll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?
__Penny Well, I'd like to pick one that works with my brother's schedule.
__Leonard Okay. And when would that be?
__Penny Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.
__Amy Hi, is Sheldon here?
__Leonard No, I thought he was with you.
__Amy He was, but he stormed off and now he isn't answering his phone.
__Leonard What happened?
__Amy He was really angry that you suggested he move out.
__Leonard Oh.
__Amy I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
__Leonard Well, he's been having a couple of tough days. I'm sure he's fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.
__Amy You're probably right. So, what are you guys doing?
__Penny Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we're just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.
__Amy That's nice.
__Leonard Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that's important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.
__Amy Don't I know it. What is that, polenta?
__Penny Amy, get out.
__Amy Right.
__Stuart Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon What happened?
__Stuart I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.
__Sheldon And you couldn't put it out?
__Stuart I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.
__Sheldon So when will you reopen?
__Stuart Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear back from the insurance company.
__Stuart I don't mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.
__Sheldon Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I'm sad is damp and smells funny.
__Stuart Well, sorry I let you down.
__Sheldon No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I'm helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.
__Stuart That'll be $2.99.
__Sheldon Really? It's soaking wet.
__Stuart Fine, a dollar.
__Sheldon Can you break a twenty?
__Stuart No, I only have hundreds.
__Sheldon You know what? I don't always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don't appreciate it. I'm sorry for your loss. But you're not the only one whose day has been a disaster.
__Stuart That could have killed me. I can't catch a break.
__Penny Oh, I'm sure he's fine.
__Leonard I'm gonna see where he is.
__Penny How?
__Leonard Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.
__Penny You do that?
__Leonard Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.
__Penny He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.
__Leonard That's weird.
__Penny What?
__Leonard He's at the train station.
__Penny So? He loves trains.
__Leonard It's dark out and he's alone, I don't like it. Let's go get him.
__Penny It's sweet how you look out for him. You're a good guy.
__Leonard It's not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.
__Howard Don't take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?
__Stuart No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.
__Raj We're here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?
__Stuart Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.
__Raj Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.
__Stuart You slept with her? Nice.
__Raj Well, I can't take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.
__Howard Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
__Stuart Great.
__Howard I just have to warn you, it'll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.
__Stuart So what's the catch?
__Sheldon You tracked my phone?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.
__Penny We were worried about you.
__Sheldon Don't be melodramatic. I'm just getting on a train and leaving forever.
__Leonard Seriously? You don't even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
__Sheldon My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It's called living off the land.
__Leonard Okay, I know you're upset and there's a lot of stuff going on, but it's nothing we can't work out. Come on, let's get you home.
__Sheldon No. I've reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.
__Penny And go where?
__Sheldon It doesn't matter.
__Leonard So a few things don't go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
__Sheldon I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I'd sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
__Leonard Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I'll, I'll take you to Legoland.
__Sheldon Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it's too much of a scene since that movie came out.
__Leonard Then what can I do?
__Leonard Oh, come on, you know you're overreacting.
__Penny Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.
__Leonard What? Why?
__Penny It might be good for him.
__Leonard You know he can't take a trip like this by himself.
__Penny He's a grown man.
__Leonard No, he looks like a grown man. You've seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.
__Penny Leonard, we can't protect him forever.
__Leonard I know, but…
__Penny He'll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.
__Sheldon Good Lord. Padawan's the student, not the teacher.
__Penny Seriously, let him go.
__Leonard Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I'm not gonna stand in your way.
__Sheldon I do.
__Leonard Okay. Good luck.
__Penny Be safe and call us.
__Sheldon I will.
__Leonard Bye, buddy. Sheldon?
__Sheldon Yes?
__Leonard I'm gonna miss you.
__Leonard He just made that easier.
__Penny Mm.
__Howard You sure?
__Stuart Yeah, she's fed, she took her pills, she's all tucked in and watching TV.
__Bernadette So, she's not too much for you?
__Stuart Are you kidding? I love her, she's great.
__Mrs Wolowitz Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?
__Stuart Coming, Debbie.
__Howard You call her Debbie?
__Stuart She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.
__Howard Was that a little weird?
__Bernadette Yeah. I don't know why, but something about it feels unnatural.
__Howard Okay, let's go.
__Bernadette Yep.
__Leonard He's okay?
__Amy Actually sounds like he's doing pretty well.
__Penny I really think this is gonna be for the best.
__Leonard Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…
__Amy How could you let him go?
__Man I don't think so.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, I understand that I'm half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I'll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won't anybody help me?
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Hi. Want to do yoga with me?
__Leonard Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I'll have the strength to tell you how much I won't be doing that.  Hello?
__Sheldon Hello, Leonard.
__Leonard Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.
__Sheldon Uh, I'm in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.
__Leonard I'd love to. I'm just about to do yoga with Penny.
__Sheldon Leonard, I'm at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.
__Leonard Oh, my God, are you okay?
__Sheldon No, I'm not okay. Uh, I'm wearing borrowed pants, I don't have I.D., and one of the officers here won't stop calling me chicken legs.
__Leonard Okay. Uh, I'll, I'll come get you. What's the address?
__Penny Hey, what's going on?
__Leonard He got all of his stuff stolen.
__Penny Oh.
__ 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon Hurry.
__Leonard Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?
__Sheldon Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony silence.
__Leonard I'll be there as soon as I can.
__Penny Is he okay?
__Leonard Yeah, he's fine, he's just a little rattled.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard Feel like driving to Arizona with me?
__Penny I can't, I have that job interview.
__Leonard Oh, right.
__Penny Besides, I don't need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I'm holding my breath until your hair grows back.
__Leonard All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn't invite Amy to come with me?
__Penny Nope.
__Leonard Come on, you didn't even try.
__Howard What's wrong with your car?
__Raj I'm having my windows untinted.
__Howard Why?
__Raj Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.
__Howard What are you talking about? No one's paying attention to you.
__Raj Wow. How's that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn't the way to work.
__Howard I just want to pop in and make sure Ma's okay.
__Raj I thought Stuart was looking after her.
__Howard He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I'm kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.
__Raj How so?
__Howard I don't know, they're, chummy.
__Raj Like us?
__Howard No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.
__Raj She feeds him out of her own mouth?
__Howard I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they're all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.
__Howard First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I'm her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.
__Raj Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active…
__Howard I said well past it.
__Hernandez Not yet.
__Sheldon Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?
__Hernandez Nope.
__Sheldon Well, maybe you should. There's lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there's no books called Officer Hernandez.
__Amy My pleasure. And I'm not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,
__Leonard Yeah, time's gonna fly by.
__Bernadette Don't be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You're cute, you're flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things.
__Penny I don't have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.
__Bernadette This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos 'cause they're about to go bad, you're just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.
__Penny They do?
__Bernadette Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He's the guy who'll be interviewing you.
__Penny Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I'm not in over my head.
__Bernadette You'll be fine. Just be yourself.
__Penny I wish I felt more confident.
__Bernadette Penny, I wouldn't have put you up for this job if I didn't think you could handle it.
__Penny Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.
__Bernadette It's too late to cancel. You're going.
__Penny But I don't know anything about pharmaceuticals.
__Bernadette Oh, I understand. You want to do something you're already good at. I know. Why don't I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?
__Penny They're comfortable.
__Stuart Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?
__Howard Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.
__Stuart Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to talking over dinner the other night. I didn't have any place to go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at the same time. It was precious.
__Howard It's not that precious.
__Raj I'd like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.
__Mrs Wolowitz Stewie, I can't find my glasses.
__Stuart Be right there, Deb Deb. They're probably on her head.
__Howard Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would've talked to me about.
__Stuart Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you'd know.
__Raj It wouldn't kill you to pick up the phone.
__Hernandez We're doing everything we can.
__Sheldon You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I'm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon Leonard. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
__Amy Are you okay?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm fine. Why did you come?
__Amy What do you mean, why did I come? You're my boyfriend. I haven't seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don't you have anything to say besides why did you come?
__Sheldon I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.
__Amy Fine. Whisper it.
__Sheldon Shotgun.
__Sheldon Where didn't I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.
__Leonard How were they?
__Sheldon Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.
__Leonard Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
__Sheldon Why would I? That's where all the cool trains are.
__Leonard I'm sorry, so you never went outside?
__Sheldon Or had a single piece of fruit.
__Penny Well, I'm a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I'm saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I'm done.
__Dan You sure?
__Penny People. Yes.
__Dan Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this?
__Penny Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.
__Dan Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.
__Penny People.
__Raj That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.
__Howard Come on, you don't think it's a little odd?
__Raj I don't know. I mean, she's lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there's any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They're both adults.
__Howard Who cares? You wouldn't care if I slept with your mom?
__Raj You know what? You're my best friend, and she's in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.
__Howard This is stupid. I'm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.
__Raj ‘Cause that's what little matzo balls do.
__Stuart This is Debbie.
__Mrs Wolowitz And this is Stuart.
__Together Just kidding.
__Stuart Leave a message.
__Raj This is the part where you talk.
__Penny Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I'm really sorry for wasting your time.
__Dan Don't worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.
__Penny Okay, thanks. Um, I'm sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She'll get upset. And honestly I'm a, a little terrified of her.
__Dan Wait, wait. You're scared of Bernadette?
__Penny Yeah, kind of.
__Penny I know, but she's kind of a bully.
__Dan Wll, she is. I didn't even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.
__Penny Me, too.
__Dan Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing.
__Penny What happened?
__Dan I couldn't do it. She's still working on it. Oh, we're not gonna tell her about this, right?
__Penny Oh, my God, no.
__Leonard I don't care.
__Sheldon Wrong. Hunt's. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?
__Amy Have you not noticed that I've been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
__Sheldon I just thought you were bad at the game.
__Amy I'm mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?
__Sheldon Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?
__Amy We're in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?
__Sheldon Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that'll work. Please? This'll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can't hear. The reason I called you is because I didn't want Amy to know I couldn't make it on my own.
__Leonard What's the big deal?
__Sheldon Oh, of course it's no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.
__Leonard Well, yeah, it's true. You, you are a god to me.
__Amy Can I stop now?
__Leonard Just tell her.
__Sheldon I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn't want you to think less of me.
__Amy You were worried about that?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Amy Sheldon, it's okay with me that you're not perfect.
__Sheldon Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
__Amy Sure.
__Sheldon Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.
__Howard She did?
__Bernadette Well, the only reason she got it is 'cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.
__Howard What do you want?
__Stuart I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom's.
__Howard You're right, I'm not. I think it's weird.
__Bernadette Howie?
__Howard It is. He's a grown man. He's just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?
__Stuart Hey, you're not my father, okay? And besides, your mother and I were talking…
__Howard Your mother and I? You're not my father.
__Stuart I didn't say I was your father.
__Howard Well, I didn't say I was your father.
__Stuart I, I'm sorry you don't like my life choices, but it's my life.
__Howard Well, it's my house, it's my rules.
__Stuart Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?
__Bernadette Hey, don't you take that sarcastic tone with him.
__Stuart I don't have to listen to you.
__Howard Don't talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.
__Stuart You know what? This isn't getting us anywhere. When you're ready to apologize, you know where to find me.
__Howard Yeah, in my house.
__Stuart That's right, sucka.
__Amy But you still accomplished something.
__Leonard Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?
__Sheldon That I couldn't do it?
__Leonard Exactly. Right after they said yeah.
__Amy But you did do it. So what if it didn't all go your way? That's what makes it an adventure.
__Sheldon That's a good point. You know, I'm a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, 'cause I wasn't in direct sunlight for six weeks.
__Amy See? This trip was good for you.
__Sheldon Indeed. I was the world's smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation's railway system, I've burst forth as the world's smartest butterfly.
__Leonard Butterfly could've gotten himself home from Arizona.
__Sheldon Yeah, I feel renewed. I'm ready to deal with any changes that come my way.
__All Hey.
__Penny Hey, look who's back.
__Sheldon Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can't take this. I'm out.
__Penny I thought your phone got stolen.
__Sheldon Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.
__Leonard And you thought they all had a silver lining.
__Sheldon Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn't because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.
__Penny I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.
__Sheldon I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that's when the Imodium gave out.
__Howard What a sick use of science.
__Raj Hey, as long as the baby's healthy.
__Amy I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.
__Leonard Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.
__Howard Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.
__Sheldon Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked.
__Raj But half-man, half-owl could fly…
__Sheldon The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.
__Howard So, Penny, when's the new job start?
__Penny Next Monday.
__Bernadette Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?
__Penny Uh, not yet, but I will.
__Bernadette Great. When?
__Penny I said I'll get to it.
__Sheldon I'm sensing awkwardness, am I right?
__Amy Yes.
__Bernadette I don't want to be pushy, but you've never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.
__Penny Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They'll tell me everything I need to know.
__Bernadette But imagine how impressed they'd be if you showed up already familiar with the material.
__Penny Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher's pet?
__Bernadette Couldn't hurt.
__Leonard Mm, I don't know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher's pet?
__Sheldon It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.
__Mrs Davis Dr. Cooper.
__Sheldon That's right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?
__Mrs Davis Yes. Uh, welcome back.
__Sheldon Thank you. I assume you'd like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?
__Mrs Davis You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.
__Sheldon That's the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?
__Mrs Davis Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.
__Sheldon Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?
__Mrs Davis Currently, you're being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you'll be able to choose whatever field of research you'd like.
__Sheldon But if I'm a professor, then I'll have to teach a class.
__Sheldon So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?
__Mrs Davis Yes.
__Sheldon You people are sick.
__Amy Just give me a minute. I'm stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.
__Penny What happens if you don't?
__Amy Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
__Penny Uh, no. Actually, I didn't invite her.
__Amy How come?
__Penny Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won't stop bugging me.
__Penny That is not true.
__Amy I'm still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.
__Penny I told you, they'll be right out.
__Amy Okay, so no Bernadette.
__Penny Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?
__Amy No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone's being talked about behind their back, it's me and it's right in front of my face.
__Penny I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her.
__Amy I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.
__Penny So, what are you saying?
__Amy I'm saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank's problem?
__Howard Why is it your last name and her first name?
__Raj Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn't seem right about Koothrapeeney.
__Leonard Hey, how'd it go with human resources?
__Sheldon Awful. They're allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.
__Raj I don't understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?
__Sheldon What a stupid question.
__Leonard The kids are gonna love him.
__Sheldon I can't believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what's in their diapers.
__Leonard This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they're wrong.
__Sheldon Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do.
__Raj You enjoy giving people grades.
__Sheldon A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.
__Howard And you love the sound of your own voice.
__Leonard Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.
__Sheldon It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That's rich. I'll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.
__Amy Hey, what's going on?
__Bernadette Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?
__Amy No Penny?
__Bernadette Not tonight. I'm a little frustrated with her.
__Amy Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
__Bernadette So it's not just me. You see it, too.
__Amy I do, I see it.
__Bernadette It's driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.
__Amy That's outrageous.
__Bernadette I know.
__Amy If she doesn't do well, this could reflect poorly on you.
__Bernadette Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?
__Amy I don't know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.
__Sheldon There is no class.
__Howard Did you send everyone to the principal's office already?
__Sheldon No one signed up.
__Leonard Well, that's not your fault.
__Sheldon I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.
__Leonard What?
__Raj Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.
__Sheldon No, it's fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.
__Raj Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they're wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I'd throw the cookies away.
__Howard Hey, what if I took your class?
__Sheldon Why would you do that?
__Leonard Yeah, why would you do that?
__Raj What's wrong with you?
__Howard I'm thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?
__Sheldon Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don't think you'd understand a single thing I was talking about.
__Raj Ask why not again, I've got an answer.
__Howard Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough to take your class.
__Sheldon No.
__Howard Yes.
__Sheldon How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
__Howard I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.
__Sheldon Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?
__Howard I'd use Feynman's trick, differentiate under the integral sign.
__Sheldon Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?
__Howard Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I'll say that. Now do you think I'm smart enough?
__Sheldon No.
__Howard Oh, come on. You might've gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.
__Sheldon You take that back.
__Howard No.
__Sheldon I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?
__Sheldon Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.
__Amy But I'm just…
__Sheldon Not now.
__Amy You better watch that attitude, buddy. You're dating the popular girl now.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don't really understand it.
__Leonard Sheldon, why are you doing this?
__Sheldon I'm a teacher, Leonard. It's my job.
__Leonard No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz?
__Sheldon Oh, it's no trouble, it's actually a pleasure.
__Leonard You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can't deal with it.
__Sheldon Interesting point. You're suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.
__Leonard Might be something to think about.
__Sheldon Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Howard's allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?
__Sheldon Okay, now that everyone's here, we can begin.
__Howard Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you're gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I'm out. But if you're interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I'm willing to give this a shot.
__Sheldon I suppose that's a fair request. There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience.
__Howard Okay.
__Sheldon Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?
__Howard I am.
__Sheldon Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?
__Howard It's an inverted cycloid.
__Sheldon Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?
__Howard That's where I'm a little fuzzy.
__Sheldon Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I'm grading on a curve, so you're pretty much guaranteed a C.
__Howard All I do is win, win, win no matter what.
__Sheldon What are you doing?
__Howard Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!
__Sheldon What are you doing?
__Sheldon Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.
__Howard Okay.
__Sheldon Now, where was I? Let's see. Oh, yes. Over here. You… What are you doing now?
__Howard Making a straw.
__Howard So I can shoot you with a spitball.
__Sheldon You're not going to do that, and I'll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you're going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!
__Howard Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don't think I can do that again.
__Amy Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.
__Penny Uh, thanks, but I think I'm gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.
__Amy Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you're not a bicycle, why's she riding you like that?
__Penny No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So…
__Amy Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she's a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.
__Bernadette Hey, Amy.
__Amy Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.
__Bernadette That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I'd come by and help her study.
__Amy Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She's probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?
__Bernadette I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we're good.
__Amy Oh. Great. I'm happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren't getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.
__Bernadette Well, don't worry, everything's back to normal.
__Amy You mean, like, where she's nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.
__Sheldon Can't talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.
__Leonard Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.
__Sheldon Are you sure? It just doesn't feel as innocent as it used to.
__Howard You reported me to human resources?
__Sheldon You violated the sanctity of my mouth.
__Sheldon I told you you weren't smart enough to take it.
__Howard I'm smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I'm not familiar with doesn't prove anything. I could do the same to you.
__Sheldon Yeah, try me.
__Howard Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?
__Sheldon Young's modulus.
__Raj Is that right?
__Howard Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?
__Sheldon Laminate the core material.
__Leonard Come on, give him a hard one.
__Howard That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don't know, do you? What's the matter, smart guy? Don't know Poiseuille's law?
__Sheldon Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.
__Penny Headaches, dizziness and nausea.
__Bernadette Yes.
__Penny Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.
__Bernadette Want to stop here?
__Penny Uh, no. I can keep going.
__Bernadette Nah, you got this. Let's go for a drink. I'll call Amy.
__Penny Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.
__Amy Amy (phone ringing, running down stairs from outside Penny's door): Hey, girl.
__Raj 250 million years.
__Leonard Yes.
__Howard Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.
__Sheldon Oh! It's not even Easter time. This is crazy.
__Howard Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?
__All together The Rhombicosidodecahedron.
__Leonard We are so smart.
__Raj Why didn't girls like us in high school?
__Leonard Right again.
__Leonard Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.
__Howard All right.
__Raj You suck, Wolowitz.
__Howard What's that about?
__Raj I'm heckling you. It's a beloved part of baseball.
__Sheldon He's right. And given that you're probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I'm sure you do suck.
__Penny Hi. What's going on?
__Penny Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.
__Leonard He's practicing.
__Penny For what?
__Howard The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?
__Penny What, you? Really?
__Howard Well, a lot of people who weren't available, but then me.
__Penny That's so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
__Sheldon Well, not just him. May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.
__Penny I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn't something you forget.
__Leonard C'mon now, throw one.
__Howard All right, here we go.
__Raj You look like a jackass.
__Howard Cut it out. You're hurting my feelings.
__Leonard Now you know why we're not outside.
__Amy No, and neither did our waiter.
__Sheldon Well, if you're going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.
__Amy It's hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.
__Penny Hey, how was dinner?
__Sheldon Good, I had Cornish game hen.
__Leonard Oh, that poor waiter.
__Amy Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?
__Penny You guys are going out two nights in a row?
__Sheldon I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I'm contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.
__Penny That's so hot.
__Amy It's better than hot, it's binding.
__Sheldon If you're free tomorrow night, I'd love to have you join us on a double date.
__Penny Aw.
__Amy You are aware that a double date doesn't count as two dates.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, then come or don't. I don't care.
__Howard Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.
__Bernadette But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.
__Howard For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.
__Bernadette I'm kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
__Howard They're doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn't say no.
__Bernadette Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.
__Bernadette Great. And while we're at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.
__Howard What's wrong with the way I run?
__ Bernadette; Oh, just kidding. Nothing.
__Sheldon At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.
__Amy I then suggested a pub.
__Sheldon Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.
__Leonard You don't even like Yorkshire pudding.
__Sheldon No, it's yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.
__Amy After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.
__Leonard Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
__Sheldon Ignore them, Amy. They're just jealous because they'll never have a relationship as good as ours.
__Penny Isn't this when he says bazooka or something?
__Sheldon I wasn't making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.
__Leonard You don't honestly think that, do you?
__Sheldon Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.
__Leonard There isn't any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn't be at the bottom of it.
__Penny Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.
__Leonard That's the part you have a problem with?
__Penny Relax.
__Amy There they go, fighting again. You'd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.
__Howard Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad's Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.
__Bernadette All right, the pitcher's mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.
__Howard Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?
__Bernadette Keep going.
__Howard How about now?
__Bernadette I'll let you know.
__Howard Are you saying stop and we're just too far away to hear you?
__Bernadette Okay, stop.
__Howard Are you kidding me?!
__Bernadette That's sixty feet.
__Howard There's no way this is sixty feet.
__Howard You realize this isn't one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.
__Sheldon For starters, we enjoy spending time together.
__Leonard So do we. And I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
__Sheldon It's called parallel play.
__Leonard Yeah, toddlers do that.
__Sheldon Not as well as we do.
__Leonard You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.
__Penny So what? Why do you even care?
__Sheldon Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon's over.
__Leonard Whatever. You can't even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
__Sheldon If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.
__Amy It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now, 'cause there's about to be a fire.
__Howard That's your help? That's like saying here's how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.
__Bernadette Just throw the ball. Let's see what we're working with.
__Raj Come on Howard, fire it in.
__Bernadette Throw the damn ball!
__Penny Uh, we're not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.
__Sheldon May I have one of your fries?
__Amy Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
__Sheldon Absolutely not.
__Leonard Some perfect couple. He won't even share his food with her.
__Sheldon It has avocado on it. She's allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
__Leonard I'm not jealous. I just think it's silly for you to compare relationships like they're something that can be quantified.
__Sheldon Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.
__Leonard How ridiculous is he?
__Penny A hundred.
__Leonard Sheldon, you're just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.
__Sheldon No, I'm not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I'd order a clown wig.
__Penny Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.
__Sheldon Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.
__Penny Oh, what did those rascals do now?
__Amy They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.
__Sheldon Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That's pure Cooper.
__Leonard So, this is accurate?
__Sheldon It's been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.
__Penny Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.
__Sheldon Kind of? It does it perfectly.
__Amy Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.
__Leonard Fine. We'll take it right now.
__Penny No, don't.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Just don't take it.
__Leonard Why not?
__Penny ‘Cause it's stupid. Who cares what number it is?
__Leonard Come on. It'll be fun.
__Penny I said I don't want you to. I'm getting another drink.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Amy I'm gonna let you count this as two dates. They're a lot of work.
__Raj Yup.
__Howard That was a close one.
__Bernadette Okay.
__Raj Is it too late for him to cancel?
__Bernadette I think so.
__Howard Heads up! Watch out!
__Penny No, stop being stupid.
__Leonard Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?
__Penny Look, I don't need a score on a test to make me worry about something I'm already worried about.
__Leonard What are you worried about?
__Penny That we're engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.
__Leonard Yeah, that scares me, too.
__Penny It does?
__Penny Well, that's not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.
__Leonard Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we're both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that's something that we have in common. Also, we both think I'm not funny. Huh? See, you're not laughing.
__Howard Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?
__Mike Yeah. Don't do it. What else you up to?
__Howard Why shouldn't I do it?
__Mike There's no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you're an idiot on YouTube forever.
__Howard But it's for a good cause. What about all the kids that'll be there?
__Mike That's what I'm telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.
__Howard Well, maybe I'll do a good job.
__Mike I don't know. In space, you couldn't even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.
__Howard Okay, thanks for the pep talk.
__Mike Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She's so much cuter than you, I don't know how you ever got her.
__Amy No, we're sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.
__Sheldon Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.
__Leonard I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we're a bad couple.
__Sheldon The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it's like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.
__Leonard I killed his Chewbacca slippers.
__Penny Let's just take the test.
__Leonard No, no, no, I don't want to.
__Penny Oh, well, 'cause you know we're gonna do bad.
__Leonard Because it doesn't matter. I don't care if we're a ten or a two.
__Sheldon Or a one. A one is possible.
__Leonard Marriage is scary. You're scared, I'm scared. But it doesn't make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.
__Penny Leonard.
__Sheldon We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you're happy.
__Penny Look at you, talking sports.
__Sheldon Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.
__Amy Sheldon, what did you expect?
__Sheldon I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey's Soundsational Parade.
__Amy I'll tell you what. If we stay, I'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.
__Sheldon Who's the bobblehead of?
__Amy Does it matter?
__Sheldon No, as long as it bobbles.
__Bernadette Howie, I am so proud of you.
__Howard Thanks. I'm proud of me, too.
__Man You ready?
__Howard Let's do it.
__Man All right.
__Howard Wish me luck.
__Bernadette Go get 'em.
__Stadium Announcer Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.
__Howard Thank you. Thank you.
__Penny Can he really throw a ball?
__Leonard On our Quidditch team, he…
__Penny Yeah, that's a no.
__Howard I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn't do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I'm not an athlete. I'm a scientist. So, today's first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here's the wind-up, and the pitch.
__Bernadette Why is it going so slow?
__Howard ‘Cause I'm an idiot who didn't think this through.
__Sheldon Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.
__Howard Okay, while we're waiting for the ball to arrive, here's some fun facts about Mars.
__Man in Crowd You suck, Wolowitz!
__Sheldon He makes a valid point.
__Howard Okay, booing isn't gonna make it go any faster.
__Sheldon Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.
__Howard What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
__Sheldon Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.
__Raj Hey, guys.
__Howard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj We still on for tomorrow night?
__Leonard Yeah. I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
__Sheldon Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.
__Howard Since when do you read social science?
__Raj Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?
__Leonard Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.
__Raj You guys kiss and hold hands.
__Leonard I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.
__Raj Look, I'm not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he's in a relationship.
__Leonard What happens if she doesn't like us?
__Raj Well, hey, you're my dear friends. You'll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you're dead to me.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard I don't want to talk about it.
__Bernadette But he's going to.
__Howard My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.
__Bernadette Long story short, they have seven HBOs.
__Raj Hey, guys.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj Emily, you know almost everybody here.
__Raj And this is Leonard, this is Penny.
__Emily Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
__Leonard Nice to finally meet you, too.
__Penny Hi.
__Emily Hello.
__Leonard Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.
__Raj I told you she exists.
__Penny Hey, I hear you're a dermatologist.
__Emily Uh, yeah, I'm a resident at Huntington Hospital.
__Sheldon Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don't have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.
__Bernadette You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.
__Penny Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.
__Emily Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.
__Sheldon I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?
__Emily Um, okay, I guess.
__Amy I'm with him three years, nothing. She's with him two minutes, and he's taking his pants off.
__Penny I don't know. I kind of got the sense she didn't like me.
__Bernadette Did she say she didn't like you?
__Penny Of course not. No one ever says they don't like you straight to your face.
__Amy We have led different lives.
__Bernadette You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?
__Penny It's just this vibe I got.
__Bernadette I'm sure you're worried about nothing.
__Penny Yeah. You're probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn't like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.
__Bernadette Really?
__Penny Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.
__Bernadette When you go to Emily's office to practice, you'll see. It's fine.
__Penny Yeah, I hope you're right.
__Amy You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?
__Penny Yeah.
__Amy I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.
__Howard Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.
__Leonard Okay, him I believe because he's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's tee shirt. But you're just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.
__Howard Yes, I am. You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?
__Raj You know, he might not reopen. He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.
__Sheldon Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it's those dad-gum insurance companies.
__Leonard Why? Because they won't get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?
__Howard All I know is, he's got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?
__Sheldon For starters, they shed and bite.
__Leonard Hey, here's a thought. Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?
__Raj So, we'd be, like, owners of a comic book store?
__Leonard It's kind of a dream come true.
__Howard That does sound fun.
__Raj Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.
__Sheldon I'll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.
__Leonard It's not that bad.
__Emily Hi.
__Penny Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.
__Penny Um, I brought coffee. I wasn't sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.
__Emily Thanks. If we could get started. I'm a little busy.
__Penny Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.
__Emily Great.
__Penny So, Femevra's triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.
__Emily All right.
__Penny It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.
__Emily Funny.
__Penny Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.
__Emily No, it's fine.
__Penny Are you sure, because it doesn't seem fine?
__Emily Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.
__Penny Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?
__Emily Look, it's nothing. It's just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.
__Penny What? Oh, why would he say that?
__Emily Did it not happen?
__Penny Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a hook-up.
__Emily Did you kiss?
__Penny Yeah.
__Emily Were you naked?
__Penny Yeah.
__Penny No. Yeah.
__Leonard Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.
__Howard You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.
__Raj Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?
__Sheldon Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?
__Howard Toy stores, puppet shows.
__Leonard Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?
__Raj We are now.
__Penny You told Emily we hooked up?
__Raj Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.
__Penny Why would you say that?
__Raj We were having a conversation about past lovers.
__Penny We weren't lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn't sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn't you just leave me out of it?
__Raj Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?
__Leonard Why say it?
__Penny Yes.
__Raj Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we're playing fast and loose with the word list.
__Penny Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.
__Raj Great.
__Sheldon On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next.
__Raj You, okay? It's you. You're, you're next.
__Sheldon No. You're crazy about me.
__Amy Hmm-hmm.
__Penny Almost everyone has a past.
__Bernadette Come on, look how pretty you are. I'm sure this isn't the first girl to hate you.
__Penny It's not.
__Bernadette And I'm sure you can turn it around.
__Penny How? You can't force someone to like you.
__Amy What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you're in her home, you're eating her food, drinking her wine.
__Penny No, that won't work.
__Amy You're right. Cheers.
__Bernadette Oh, I know. Why don't you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?
__Penny What?
__Bernadette Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you'd be selling Penny. it's cute.
__Penny It's stupid.
__Bernadette Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn't crap all over their ideas.
__Amy I'm gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn't I? I mean, we go way back.
__Penny Oh, my God. I didn't used to like you.
__Amy Shh. Amy's here now.
__Howard We'll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
__Howard You say things like that all the time.
__Sheldon Yes, but as a store owner, I'll finally have a good comeback to, You don't work here, shut up.
__Leonard Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?
__Howard Yeah.
__Leonard Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?
__Sheldon I'm sure she did.
__Leonard Why?
__Sheldon Because if she hadn't, she'd still be wading through the list.
__Leonard Will you stay out of this?
__Sheldon If only Penny had said that once in a while.
__Howard Hey, what difference does it make? You're the one she wants to marry.
__Leonard That's true.
__Howard Yeah, and I'm not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.
__Sheldon Yeah, he's right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.
__Leonard Why are you even part of this conversation? You don't know anything about women.
__Sheldon I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I'd ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.
__Howard He's right.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.
__Penny What's up?
__Leonard Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart's comic book store. Is that okay?
__Leonard Well, you know, we're engaged, and it's kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.
__Penny Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Huh.
__Bernadette Nope.
__Howard But you didn't hear what it was.
__Bernadette I know.
__Howard Oh, come on.
__Bernadette Fine. What is it?
__Howard It's to help reopen the comic book store.
__Bernadette Nope.
__Howard Well, hear me out.
__Howard I know, but all the guys are doing it. We're splitting it four ways, so it's really not that much money.
__Bernadette It just seems like a risky investment.
__Howard I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.
__Bernadette Oh. Howie, I had no idea.
__Howard Well, I don't like to talk about it.
__Bernadette Oh, baby. That story's made up, isn't it?
__Howard That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.
__Amy Of course.
__Sheldon Now, before I start, I need you to know that I'm very excited about this, and anything you say that isn't enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.
__Amy I'm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Perfect. Now, I'm considering investing in Stuart's comic book store.
__Amy Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?
__Sheldon No.
__Amy Then I think it's a terrific idea.
__Sheldon Great. Wait till you hear about our van.
__Penny Hi.
__Raj Thanks for inviting us over.
__Penny Oh, thank you for coming.
__Emily Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.
__Penny No, no. No need to apologise.
__Raj Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?
__Penny Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.
__Raj It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.
__Penny Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.
__Emily Mm. I'd like that, too. Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.
__Penny Oh, that's so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.
__Raj It's true, you're both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I've been alone most of my adult life.
__Howard Well, I don't need a reason, it's my house.
__Stuart Technically, it's your mom's house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.
__Howard I'm always welcome.
__Stuart Mm, just try and call first.
__Bernadette Okay, let's get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.
__Stuart Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.
__Howard What?
__Stuart Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.
__Howard Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I'm your bubala. You can't have more than one bubala.
__Penny Yeah, me, too.
__Emily You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.
__Penny Oh, we would love that.
__Raj Great.
__Penny Okay, good night, guys.
__Emily All right, night.
__Penny Bye.
__Emily and Penny I hate her.
__Leonard I know. I was looking forward to it.
__Sheldon It would've been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.
__Howard With comfy seats.
__Raj And snacks.
__Sheldon Well, I guess it was too good to be true.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Leonard We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?
__Howard Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.
__Sheldon I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.
__Leonard That's not what happened.
__Sheldon I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss's death.
__Howard No one wants to hear it.
__Sheldon Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.
__Leonard Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea.
__Sheldon Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?
__Raj Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
__Howard Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
__Raj Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
__Howard And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.
__Leonard I think someone owes me an apology.
__Sheldon Well, don't feel bad. I think we've all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.
__Howard You admit Amy's a distraction?
__Sheldon Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you're having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?
__Leonard Well, maybe we have lost our focus.
__Raj Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.
__ LeonardLike our own science retreat.
__ My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
__Sheldon I'm not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
__Leonard Then we'll go to a hotel.
__Sheldon A hotel? Did you see The Shining?
__Raj We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
__Sheldon Did you see The Lake House?
__Sheldon Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.
__Leonard Fine. Then we'll just stay here and do it.
__Sheldon Well, you didn't suggest a beach house.
__Leonard You would go to a beach house?
__Leonard Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that's okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.
__Penny Want to go to Vegas this weekend?
__Amy Of course I do.
__Penny Bernadette? Girl's weekend. Vegas. You in?
__Bernadette Hell, yeah.
__Penny Yes. I'll check flights.
__Bernadette I'll check hotels.
__Amy I'll check my underpants. I'm so excited, I think I peed.
__Leonard They seem okay with it.
__Leonard Hey.
__Howard Hey. I didn't think you'd make it.
__Raj Why not?
__Howard Well, 'cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you'd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.
__Raj For your information, Emily is working tonight.
__Sheldon Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.
__Leonard Okay, let's focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let's change the world.
__Sheldon Thinking caps on.
__Howard Here we go.
__Raj Ooh, this is exciting. We're innovating. I feel like we're in the Facebook movie.
__Howard Oh. I never saw that.
__Sheldon Really?
__Raj Oh. It's wonderful, and I swear I'm not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.
__Sheldon Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.
__Raj Cool. I'll make the popcorn.
__Leonard Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let's change the world to let's watch TV.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Is that a no?
__Howard Okay. No. Leonard's right. We're here to focus. Didn't we used to have a list of all our ideas?
__Leonard I, I think I still have it.
__Sheldon I did not get a clear answer. I'm gonna set this down now.
__Leonard Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven't looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.
__Howard Mm, that was mine.
__Leonard Robot prostitute.
__Sheldon Wait. I'm confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
__Howard There's just some things you don't do with your robot girlfriend.
__Raj Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.
__Leonard Okay, let's just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.
__Howard No, it vibrates. Keep going.
__Leonard You know, let's just come up with something new.
__Sheldon You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I've long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.
__Raj Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven't been invented yet.
__Leonard How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
__Sheldon If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty's hover board, that would have universal application.
__Raj Oh, I have an idea.
__Sheldon I think I have the same one.
__Howard We got to watch Back to the Future II.
__Raj I'll make the popcorn.
__Amy Ooh. There's a cover band in the lounge.
__Penny Nah.
__Amy But they play Barry Manilow.
__Penny No.
__Amy But they're called Fairly Manilow.
__Penny Oh. Okay.
__Penny No.
__Penny Well, we're in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.
__Amy What if we don't want to vomit?
__Penny Oh, you will. That's why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.
__Amy What?
__Amy What does that mean?
__Penny It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.
__Bernadette That sucks.
__Amy Can you start in the morning?
__Penny Uh, it's kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I'll catch up with you guys later.
__Bernadette You sure?
__Penny Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.
__Amy So, um, now that Penny's not coming…
__Bernadette We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.
__Amy Okay.
__Leoanard This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.
__Sheldon Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?
__Leonard What do you mean?
__Sheldon Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
__Leonard Had will have placed?
__Sheldon That's my boy.
__Leonard Okay, so, it wasn't until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That's when he altered the timeline.
__Sheldon Yeah, but he had will haven't placed it!
__Howard What?
__Sheldon Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn't be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn't the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…
__Leonard Wait. Is brought right?
__Sheldon Marty and Doc never had have had brought?
__Leonard I don't know. You did it to me.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn't, never had have hasn't.
__Raj He's right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.
__Howard Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.
__Sheldon Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?
__Raj Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
__Leonard Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.
__Sheldon I don't think it worked.
__Bernadette I think after this, I'll be dead.
__Amy Look at us out, while Penny's in the room studying.
__Bernadette I'm proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It's nice to see her take it seriously.
__Amy It is. But enough about Penny. Let's talk about us. We're looking good.
__Bernadette We are.
__Amy Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body's bangin'.
__Bernadette Amy.
__Amy Don't Amy me. We're always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?
__Bernadette You're embarrassing me.
__Amy Oh, don't be embarrassed. I'll show you the divot in my spine.
__Bernadette What?
__Amy No, no, it's okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.
__Sheldon Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.
__Raj Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.
__Leonard So, I've been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there's a way we could use Maglev technology.
__Howard Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.
__Sheldon Well, I wonder if anyone's tried that.
__Raj Go online and look it up.
__ Shortly afterwards.
__ Oh, I can't argue with him. It's right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.
__Raj That's nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.
__Leonard I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny. Can we get back to work?
__Sheldon Yeah, he's right. Oh, here's a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?
__Howard Like behavior modification?
__Sheldon Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?
__Raj That cannot be true.
__ Shortly afterwards.
__ Hey, it was match point.
__Leonard Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
__Raj Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
__Howard We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
__Sheldon Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold's bridle. It's an iron cage that's locked around the head and pierces the tongue.
__Leonard If only we had one.
__Amy We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.
__Bernadette It was us the whole time.
__Bernadette Was it working?
__Penny Yeah.
__Bernadette Oh, I'm so sorry.
__Penny You guys look like you're having fun.
__Amy We're having the best time.
__Bernadette Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.
__Penny That's a dollar.
__Bernadette Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.
__Amy Hey, Penny, hey, let's go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.
__Bernadette We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
__Amy Can you believe this nerd?
__Bernadette Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man's G-string like a baby kangaroo?
__Penny All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I've got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he's taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.
__Bernadette Aren't you gonna chase her?
__Penny To the walk-in closet? Sure.
__Raj And I really can't let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I've been cheating on her.
__Leonard All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…
__Sheldon Wait, a question, who decides if someone's gone off topic?
__Leonard I think it'll be pretty clear. If not, we'll take a vote. Oh, and also…
__Sheldon Ow. We didn't vote!
__Leonard We didn't have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we're leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?
__Sheldon You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That's a tangent and it's your fault.
__Howard That's ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.
__Leonard Thank you. And now I owe you one.
__Howard Hey.
__Raj Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I'm gonna hear it from Jenny.
__Leonard Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn't working.
__Sheldon I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It's a common mistake.
__Howard Negative reinforcement is really wrong?
__Sheldon Oh, it's used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.
__Raj No way. Not Bill Murray.
__ Shortly afterwards.
__ I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
__Raj Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.
__Howard Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Leonard's right. We can't just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.
__Leonard Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.
__Raj Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.
__Leonard It's late. We've wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?
__Sheldon But we didn't see them bust one ghost.
__Leonard So you're, you're saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard It really does hold up.
__Penny Yep. Shake that thing.
__Bernadette Have you ever seen a body so fine?
__Amy We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that.
__Bernadette Would you please close the drapes?
__Amy Okay.
__Penny Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.
__Howard How does it feel knowing your fiancée's job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?
__Leonard She doesn't flirt with doctors.
__Penny Yeah. It's all very professional.
__Amy You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?
__Penny Okay, good.
__Bernadette Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?
__Sheldon Oh, yeah, I'd have to say it's the most exiting time in the history of the field.
__Bernadette Oh. What's going on?
__Sheldon I started doing it.
__Raj You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.
__Leonard Yeah, I've read about that, they're sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.
__Raj You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.
__Penny Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?
__Sheldon Why not?
__Penny You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
__Sheldon Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
__Leonard I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it's like a cat riding a Roomba.
__Howard If they get scared, they'll have those hats with the lights on them, 'cause down there it's night-night all the time.
__Bernadette Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
__Leonard Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.
__Sheldon Are they making fun of us?
__Raj Yup.
__Sheldon I miss the old days when I couldn't tell.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny I'm sorry, I was thinking about work.
__Leonard Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…
__Penny Yeah, that's when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I've got some good news.
__Leonard Hmm.
__Penny This is for you.
__Leonard Huh. What is this?
__Penny Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn't make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.
__Leonard The one I gave you?
__Penny Yeah. And there's your money back, and now we're even. How great is that?
__Leonard Uh, yeah.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Nothing.
__Penny Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn't make sense to have both.
__Leonard You're right.
__Penny What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?
__Leonard Doesn't sound that bad.
__Penny Well, good, because that's what I did.
__Leonard Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.
__Penny Well, it's not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.
__Leonard You know what, you don't have to give me this. You keep it.
__Penny Why?
__Leonard The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.
__Penny And I really appreciate it, but now I don't need it, so here you go.
__Leonard Well, this is silly, so you don't need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.
__Penny Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.
__Leonard I know, and I'm proud of you, but that doesn't mean I can't do something nice. Like this.
__Penny Okay, I don't want this to turn into a fight.
__Leonard I don't, either.
__Penny Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?
__Leonard Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.
__Sheldon I'm always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I'm attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I'm composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I've solved the Penrose conjecture, and I'm wondering how mermaids have babies.
__Raj Don't they lay eggs on a rock?
__Sheldon Now I've got room for another thing. What do you want?
__Raj So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it's very humid, and about a hundred degrees.
__Sheldon Well, I'm from Texas and you're from India, we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.
__Raj It's also a live mine, so there'll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.
__Sheldon Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.
__Raj Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.
__Sheldon Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
__Raj Well, there's no toilets, we'll have to do our business in a bucket.
__Sheldon So it's settled, we're not doing it.
__Raj Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.
__Sheldon Interesting. You're suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
__Raj Exactly.
__Sheldon Very well.
__Raj So where should we do it?
__Sheldon Well, I'll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.
__Raj Uh, Sheldon…
__Sheldon Oh, there, well, look, there's all kinds of videos.
__Penny Hi. Sure.
__Leonard I was hoping we could talk about the money again.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.
__Leonard No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.
__Penny Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.
__Leonard Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.
__Penny Mm.
__Leonard Why don't we just put the money in a joint account? It'll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.
__Penny You know what, that's great. I love that.
__Leonard Yeah, of course you do, I'm not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.
__Penny You two want to be alone?
__Leonard I want you to know I get why you don't want the money, you've got this new job, you're excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.
__Penny Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I'm trying to be sensitive to that.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Well, I just think that maybe you're a little hung up on the money because I'm less reliant on you now, and that's a little scary.
__Leonard Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
__Penny Control issues?
__Leonard Maybe.
__Penny Or, maybe now that I'm no longer an out-of-work actress who can't pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.
__Leonard Well, I can't believe you'd say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.
__Penny You know what? I'm sorry. It's stupid to fight over money.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm sorry, too. We're about to share the rest of our lives together. It's our money, who cares who has it?
__Penny Ugh, You're right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.
__Amy Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.
__Raj Did you get in?
__Amy No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.
__Sheldon Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.
__Raj This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
__Sheldon Plus, there's almost no chance we'll see any of our coworkers half naked.
__Raj Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.
__Sheldon All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I'll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what's the rule?
__Amy Save you first; come back for Raj only if there's time.
__Amy Sheldon, I'm really impressed you're willing to try this.
__Sheldon Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that's gonna rocket to the top of the list.
__Raj I'm sweating already.
__Sheldon Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.
__Raj How hot is it?
__Sheldon Uh, let's see. 704? No, wait, it's on clock. Uh, the real answer isn't much better. 102 degrees.
__Raj Well, that's what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.
__Sheldon True. Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali's restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.
__Howard Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?
__Penny Well, you know, now that we're engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.
__Bernadette I told you they weren't gonna ask us to swing with them.
__Howard I didn't think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard's feelings.
__Leonard Well, nailed it.
__Howard So what did you want to know?
__Penny Well, do you guys ever fight over money?
__Bernadette Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.
__Howard You didn't have to say so much more.
__Bernadette Well, I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.
__Howard I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.
__Bernadette Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?
__Howard For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.
__Bernadette Without asking me?
__Howard There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.
__Bernadette How much, Howie?
__Howard Not a lot.
__Bernadette How much?
__Howard Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.
__Howard For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.
__Leonard Like I would swing with him.
__Sheldon Good. Little claustrophobic.
__Raj Let's set up the equipment. It'll help take your mind off of it.
__Sheldon Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
__Raj Do you know any mining songs?
__Sheldon Just the hits.  Where it's dark as a dungeon, and it's damp as the dew.
__Rajj That's pretty.
__Sheldon Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
__Raj It's a little more bleak than I thought.
__Sheldon Well, I pray when I'm dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.
__Raj Getting kind of grim.
__Sheldon Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.
__Raj Okay. How 'bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
__Sheldon Who's he?
__Bernadette Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn't also doing everything else around here.
__Howard Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.
__Penny I see it.
__Howard Do the dishes. There's a star right there.
__Bernadette That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
__Howard That pan had to soak and you know it.
__Bernadette Well, don't come crying to me when you don't get your allowance.
__Howard It's not an allowance. It's a stipend, and we said we weren't gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.
__Leonard I usually don't like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.
__Sheldon That's preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
__Raj But you're okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
__Sheldon He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
__Amy You guys doing okay down there?
__Sheldon I told you to use the walkie-talkie!
__Amy Amy (on walkie-talkie): You guys doing okay down there?
__Amy I'm going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?
__Sheldon This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.
__Amy Okay, just checking.
__Raj We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
__Sheldon You're not going to have Funyuns when we're a mile below the surface of the Earth.
__Raj What if we brought them down with us?
__Sheldon We'll take some Funyuns.
__Amy Anything else?
__Sheldon Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.
__Rajj Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.
__Penny Oh, don't apologize.
__Leonard Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
__Bernadette Money's a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.
__Penny It really bothers him?
__Bernadette Well, sure. There's still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he's happy for me, it's just a little tough on him.
__Penny Uh-oh.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.
__Leonard Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it's what I think love looks like.
__Bernadette I'll be right back. I'm gonna go check on him.
__Penny Maybe it's a good thing we came here. It's like a lesson in what not to do.
__Leonard Yeah I don't want something dumb like money to come between us.
__Penny It won't. Let's just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.
__Howard Why are you being so bossy?
__Howard I'm not a baby. I'm a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where's my star?
__Leonard Should we go?
__Penny Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.
__Sheldon As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.
__Rajj Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let's get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.
__Sheldon My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
__Raj How's that going?
__Sheldon You tell me. I feel like I can't breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.
__Raj Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.
__Sheldon We're not stopping.
__Raj You don't have to bite my head off.
__Sheldon I apologize. I just, I'm plagued by an internal struggle.
__Raj If you would just use the bucket, you'd be so much more comfortable.
__Sheldon It's dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I'm back at square one. And, frankly, it's frightening.
__Sheldon Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?
__Raj The space probe.
__Raj By the time I was born, Voyager 1's mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don't leave. You can do this.
__Amy Sheldon, is everything okay?
__Sheldon It's too late for Koothrappali. Let's go.
__Amy 11 minutes. That's longer than I thought.
__Raj They're in my shirt. They're in my shirt. They're in my shirt.
__Leonard I've never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It's my first time, too.
__Howard It's okay.
__Bernadette No, it's not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.
__Howard I want that, too.
__Bernadette Now, let's talk about your birthday party.
__Howard Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.
__Bernadette Oh.
__Sheldon You're not doing it for me. You're doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.
__Raj You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You're a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.
__Sheldon His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
__Amy I'm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
__Bernadette What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
__Bermadette Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.
__Penny Okay, if it's sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.
__Bernadette He was being funny. I'm pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn't that cool?
__Amy I think it's awful.
__Amy Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?
__Penny I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.
__Bernadette Why can't someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
__Amy I just don't think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
__Penny Okay, what's the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don't think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.
__Amy Maybe it's different in the world of sales, but it's already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.
__Bernadette I was kind of excited about the article, but now you're making me feel bad.
__Penny No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would've become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation's commerce. It's because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I'd shake your hand, but, well, you know.
__Man I'm not a delivery man, I'm a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.
__Sheldon That's humorous.
__Man All right.
__Sheldon Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.
__Man All right.
__Sheldon Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn't a joke.
__Man All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.
__Sheldon Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.
__Man I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.
__Sheldon Making the extra effort. Good for you.
__Leonard Great timing, food just got here.
__Sheldon Ooh, Siam Palace?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Uh, extra peanut sauce?
__Leonard No, but you can have mine.
__Sheldon Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak.
__Leonard What? Why didn't you say that first?
__Sheldon Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.
__Leonard Can I help you?
__Man Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?
__Leonard May I ask why?
__Man Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.
__Leonard Okay, um, look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.
__Leonard I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there's been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée.
__Man Really? I've never seen her wear an engagement ring.
__Raj Really?
__Man So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?
__Leonard I think so.
__Man When will I learn? It's just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.
__Leonard Excuse me?
__Man Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You're a, you're a lucky man.
__Leonard Thank you. Sorry.
__Man Oh, uh, you probably don't want her to see this. It's unnecessarily graphic.
__Sheldon Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.
__Leonard He tried to score with Penny.
__Sheldon So have these two, and they're having dinner with us.
__Bernadette It was fine, but you'll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.
__Amy What happened?
__Bernadette I don't know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they're rethinking it.
__Bernadette I guess. It's really not that important. Hey, up here.
__Amy Sorry, it's just we're, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn't going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I'm the reason it was pulled.
__Bernadette What? How?
__Amy I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
__Bernadette Amy, what did you say?
__Amy I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.
__Bernadette Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.
__Amy Well, it doesn't make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.
__Bernadette No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.
__Amy But it was bad publicity.
__Bernadette That's for me to decide, not you.
__Amy I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.
__Bernadette And I think you don't like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I'm so sorry. That was over the line.
__Amy You have a nice night.
__Bernadette Please don't go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.
__Man Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.
__Raj Oh, cool.
__Howard How'd you get that?
__Man Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.
__Sehldon Wait a minute. You've snipped Gene Roddenberry's vas deferens?
__Man Yes.
__Howard Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.
__Man I don't like to brag,but, uh, you see, I'm kind of the doctor to the stars' urinary tracts.
__All Wow.
__Man Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron's kidney stone?
__All Ooh.
__Man He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.
__Man Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn't really get serious until William Shatner's bladder infection.
__Sheldon What'd you get? What'd you get?
__Man Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it's pretty cool.
__Raj I would love to see your collection.
__Howard We know.
__Raj Preach.
__Man Can I ask you a personal question?
__Leonard Sure.
__Man Um, I mean, you're a guy like me, so how'd you get a girl like Penny?
__Leonard Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.
__Sheldon Oh, please, you know, I'll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.
__Leonard I don't know that I'd call myself an infection.
__Howard A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.
__Leonard Can we please change the subject?
__Penny Hi.
__Raj Well, that didn't go your way.
__Penny Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?
__Dr Lorvis Uh, well, actually I came to see you.
__Penny Really? Why?
__Leonard Ah, that's a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.
__Sheldon Oh, God. Don't make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.
__Penny Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.
__Dr Lorvis You touched my arm for two Mississippis.
__Penny Oh. That's why you were mumbling Mississippi.
__Leonard Can we talk in private?
__Penny Please, yes.
__Leonard I'll be right back.
__Sheldon So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
__Leonard So, uh, what's the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?
__Penny What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.
__Leonard Why?
__Penny Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I'm single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?
__Leonard Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.
__Penny You were okay with that?
__Leonard No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.
__Penny Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don't you think that's a little weird?
__Leonard A little, but he's basically harmless. He's actually kind of a nice guy.
__Penny Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.
__Leonard Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?
__Penny I can't do it, he's my best client.
__Leonard All right, I'll get rid of him. But you owe me one.
__Raj Hey, we're going to Oliver's house to see his collection. You want to go with us?
__Leonard Yeah, sure. You owe me.
__Sheldon Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it's in the basement of a urologist's house in Sherman Oaks.
__Dr Lorvis Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.
__Howard Oh, come on. It's a replica.
__Howard Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.
__Raj The gun from Hellboy?
__Dr Lorvis Yup.
__Dr Lorvis Bought it at auction.
__Raj Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman's testicles.
__Woman's voice Woman' Oliver, I'm going to play bingo.
__Dr Lorvis Okay, Mother. Have fun.
__Howard Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?
__Raj Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.
__Leonard Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.
__Sheldon Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?
__Leonard No, because I liked it.
__Sheldon Well, now, don't get defensive. You're oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.
__Dr Lorvis So, I've noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.
__Sheldon Yes. If you'd like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.
__Dr Lorvis So, you think she'll be single soon?
__Dr Lorvis Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.
__Sheldon Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.
__Leonard What?
__Amy Nice flowers.
__Dr Lorvis Thank you. They're for a girl. Uh, I'm being implacable and relentless.
__Amy Isn't she lucky?
__Dr Lorvis She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.
__Amy What's that?
__Dr Lorvis Unconditional love.
__Amy I guess that's all anybody wants.
__Dr Lorvis I guess so.
__Amy Well, I hope you get it.
__Dr Lorvis One Mississippi, two Mississippi.
__Sheldon No, I'd look silly in that helmet.
__Dr Lorvis Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.
__Amy But what about the other girl?
__Dr Lorvis Oh, right. I'll tell her we should just be friends.
__Penny Dr. Lorvis?
__Dr Lorvis Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?
__Howard Stick your head in there and find out.
__Raj You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.
__Leonard I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He's been gone a while.
__Raj Maybe he's playing bingo with his mommy.
__Howard It's sad how some guys can't cut the apron strings.
__Raj Okay, now you're messing with me.
__Leonard Uh, guys, we're locked in here.
__Sheldon Oh, this day just keeps getting better.
__Dr Lorvis Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met.
__Amy We all have a past.
__Penny Doc, you've got to see what you're doing is, is a little creepy.
__Dr Lorvis You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.
__Dr Lorvis Well, that's not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies.
__Penny Hey, Leonard. Guess who's back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?
__Dr Lorvis Well, they're, they're not locked in. The door just sticks.
__Penny Okay, so how do they unstick it?
__Dr Lorvis They'd need the key.
__Penny Okay. Nope. That's it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.
__Dr Lorvis Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.
__Penny Move it.
__Amy That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
__Bernadette What?
__Dr Lorvis She seems nice. Who's she?
__Penny Just walk.
__Raj One ladder left.
__Leonard Oh-hom yeah.
__Howard Yes.
__Leonard Next level.
__Penny Leonard, are you okay?
__Amy Dr. Lorvis, isn't there something you want to say?
__Dr Lorvis Yes. I'm very sorry for locking you in my home.
__Howard Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.
__Leonard Got it.
__Penny Okay, Leonard, let's go.
__Leonard Just hang on.
__Dr Lorvis Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire's prostate sonogram?
__Amy Sure.
__Penny Yeah.
__Dr Lorvis Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing.
__Howard Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.
__Leonard I know you-you don't want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.
__Howard That's fine. I don't care.
__Rajj It doesn't bug you when they go out on dates?
__Howard They're not dating. They're just two friends who went out to dinner.
__Raj And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
__Howard Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.
__Raj Like who?
__Howard Like you and your dog.
__Leonard Don't rule out the dating.
__Howard Fine, it bothers me. You happy?
__Sheldon You think you've got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
__Howard How is this helpful?
__Leonard But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as. It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.
__Sheldon True. Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Hey.
__Bernadette We brought snacks for movie night.
__Penny Oh, great. I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.
__Bernadette Right here.
__Penny Ah, You guys are the best.
__Amy What's with the clothes?
__Penny Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.
__Amy I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what's this?
__Penny That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.
__Bernadette Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.
__Penny What kind of teenager did you think I was?
__Bernadette Slutty.
__Amy Easy.
__Penny The word is popular.
__Bernadette How was your prom? Did you go?
__Amy No, but I was on clean-up crew.
__Penny Aw, that's sad.
__Amy No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.
__Bernadette My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me 'cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.
__Amy Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.
__Penny Doesn't matter. Prom is silly anyways.
__Bernadette Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.
__Penny No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
__Amy My date would've had to clean that up.
__Bernadette Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.
__Amy Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.
__Bernadette Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.
__Penny Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who's been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.
__Amy You went to seven proms?
__Penny Yeah, let's see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.
__Raj Hey.
__Leonard Hey, where's Bernadette?
__Howard She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
__Raj Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I've wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I'm back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.
__Howard Bernie's really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.
__Raj Did you go to your prom?
__Sheldon No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…
__Penny Okay, okay.
__Shldon …of AP Calculus.
__Raj How come you're not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
__Leonard Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?
__Penny Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?
__Leonard Hmm, to be honest, it's kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.
__Penny Ugh, thanks a lot.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Well, now I can't blow this thing off without being a bitch.
__Raj That sounds like a yes.
__Howard Yep.
__Bernadette Look, even Stuart's bringing a date. I wonder who it is.
__Howard You know exactly who it is. He's gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?
__Bernadette Because he's our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can't he take your mom? You took her to your prom.
__Howard I didn't take her, she was a chaperone.
__Bernadette I saw a picture of you two dancing together.
__Howard What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can't take this anymore.
__Stuart Hello.
__Howard Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It's making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you're bringing my mother to a party I'm going to? What the hell?
__Stuart I'm not bringing your mother, I have a date.
__Howard Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother?
__Stuart Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There's nothing weird going on with me and your mother.
__Mrs Wolowitz Stewie, your bath is getting cold!
__Stuart I got to go, bye.
__Penny You knocked more than usual.
__Sheldon Next time I might be in a rush, it's good to have a few in the bank.
__Penny Okay, what's up?
__Sheldon I'd like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.
__Penny Great, how?
__Sheldon We pretend we're aliens. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
__Penny Okay, just one question. What?
__Sheldon My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.
__Penny Here's a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?
__Sheldon There are post-prom mating rituals?
__Penny Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.
__Sheldon Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.
__Penny You're kidding.
__Sheldon I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you're a little turned on.
__Sheldon Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.
__Leonard Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.
__Sheldon His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.
__Leonard There, perfect.
__Sheldon What, are you sure? It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.
__Leonard I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
__Sheldon I was, but Penny didn't want to. You didn't want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.
__Leonard Was that a flask?
__Sheldon Yes. I've decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.
__Leonard You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?
__Sheldon Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It's all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.
__Leonard If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?
__Sheldon Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren't elected. It's gonna be off the hook.
__Leonard And while you're at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn't mean you have to.
__Sheldon Why would you say that?
__Leonard You know, 'cause, 'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.
__Sheldon Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?
__Penny Thank you, so do you.
__Amy Sheldon, you look so handsome.
__Amy What's that?
__Leonard Oh, it's a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you're dancing.
__Sheldon Excuse me.
__Amy Where are you going?
__Sheldon I can't do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.
__Leonard He's right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.
__Bernadette That's a neat tattoo.
__Emily Oh, thanks, it's Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.
__Bernadette Aw, that movie's so cute.
__Howard Do you like her because you both have red hair?
__Emily Uh, a little, but more that she's covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.
__Bernadette I like Cinderella.
__Emily Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?
__Bernadette I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.
__Raj Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.
__Emily Oh, she's cute.
__Howard Oh, my God.
__Bernadette What?
__Howard That's Jeanie.
__Bernadette That's Jeanie?
__Emily Who's Jeanie?
__Howard Don't say it.
__Raj That's Howard's cousin that he had sex with.
__Howard She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don't say it.
__Emily No, it's okay. He told me that story a long time ago.
__Howard Raj.
__Raj It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?
__Leonard Oh, the girls really did a nice job.
__Penny Aw, I know I wasn't into this before, but I'm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.
__Leonard What makes you think I didn't go to my prom? I went.
__Penny Well, who'd you go with?
__Leonard I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.
__Penny Aw.
__Leonard Oh, it's all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…
__Penny Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would've asked you to dance.
__Leonard No, you wouldn't have.
__Penny Well, you don't know that.
__Leonard It was before my growth spurt.
__Penny What, that already happened?
__Leonard Very funny.
__Penny Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.
__Leonard I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.
__Sheldon I don't think that's a good idea.
__Amy Why not?
__Sheldon According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.
__Amy You're making me worry. What's going on?
__Sheldon What's going on is we're about to go to a prom. And there's a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.
__Amy What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
__Sheldon It's not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I'm not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
__Rajj Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?
__Howard So, my mother's okay with this?
__Jeannie Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?
__Howard ‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.
__Raj This is so messed up.
__Emily I know, I'm having the best time.
__Howard Why would you even come to this? Didn't you know I'd be here?
__Jeannie It was a long time ago, Howard.
__Stuart And you're only second cousins, who cares?
__Bernadette So, you knew and you brought her anyway?
__Stuart Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me?
__Howard Yeah.
__Bernadette Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.
__Howard Yeah.
__Leonard There's no music.
__Penny I don't care. We'll make our own music.
__Leonard My God, who's the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.
__Penny Thank you for wearing your heels.
__Penny Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
__Leonard I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.
__Penny I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.
__Howard Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.
__Sheldon I really did think you looked pretty.
__Amy You did?
__Sheldon Yes. So much so that I started to panic.
__Amy Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.
__Sheldon Were you hoping we would because it's prom?
__Amy I'm always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.
__Sheldon Thank you for understanding.
__Amy Of course I understand. Sheldon, there's something else I've been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don't have to say it back. I know you're not ready, and I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictates…
__Sheldon I love you, too.
__Amy You said it.
__Sheldon There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what's happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
__Amy Okay.
__Sheldon Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn't mean girls are allowed in my room.
__Stuart Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry.  Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I'm here with Jeanie. Okay, but we're just friends. It's, yeah. I got to go.
__Sheldon Me.
__Amy Come on, he's an under-appreciated genius.
__Sheldon Still think it's me.
__Amy It's not you. Now think, there's a car named after him.
__Sheldon Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, 'cause it's me.
__Amy How about this, he's a poor man's Sheldon Cooper.
__Sheldon Oh, Tesla.
__Penny Hi.
__Amy Hello.
__Sheldon Hey, how did it go?
__Leonard Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.
__Penny Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.
__Amy Did they figure out what's wrong?
__Leonard Yeah. It's a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He's gonna do it next week.
__Sheldon Why would you have surgery?
__Leonard Because I can't breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.
__Penny Yeah, back off, he's all mine.
__Sheldon But you don't have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?
__Amy Sheldon, it's a routine procedure, I've heard you complain about his snoring.
__Sheldon Yes, for the first five or six years, but I've gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine.
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal. End of story.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon I believe it was your turn in the game.
__Amy Okay.
__Sheldon Let's see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.
__Leonard I think you could give a better clue.
__Sheldon I don't. I'm not even sure if that's a person or a typo.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.
__Leonard If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?
__Sheldon Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?
__Leonard What's your problem?
__Sheldon If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.
__Leonard It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.
__Sheldon I have to be honest with you Leonard, I'm truly worried.
__Leonard I told you, there's nothing to worry about.
__Sheldon Well, I've been doing some research and I've learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.
__Leonard Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don't die?
__Sheldon I suppose that's true. You're such a glass half-full kind of guy. I'm going to miss that.
__Howard Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?
__Bernadette Not anymore.
__Raj Anyway, any ideas on a gift?
__Bernadette Well, what are some of the things they like?
__Raj They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.
__Bernadette He said that to her?
__Raj Well, they weren't speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.
__Bernadette They're yours in the divorce.
__Sheldon Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?
__Leonard Yeah?
__Sheldon Well, I've been crunching the numbers, and so far, I've gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.
__Leonard Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.
__Sheldon Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon's latex gloves?
__Leonard I'm not allergic to latex.
__Leonard For the same reason I don't wear the apron or the hair net.
__Sheldon Fine. What about epilepsy?
__Leonard I don't have epilepsy, either.
__Sheldon You don't, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.
__Leonard Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?
__Sheldon I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don't expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.
__Leonard Buddy, I, I get that you're worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I'm not going to die.
__Sheldon You don't know that.
__Leonard Well, I do know that it won't be from an asteroid strike.
__Sheldon You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
__Leonard If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn't you die, too?
__Sheldon I don't know, I'm smart and scrappy, I think I'd find a way.
__Leonard Tell you what, the surgery's not for a week, I'll think about it.
__Sheldon Thank you. And while you're thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.
__Howard So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you're cool being the only adults there, they said they are.
__Raj Dude, my parents just split up.
__Howard What?
__Raj Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.
__Howard Oh, my God, I, I'm sorry. I mean, if you're not up to it, we don't have to go out, we can just hang here.
__Raj No, it's fine. It's not that big a deal. As long as they're happy, I'm happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I'll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That's double the Diwali.
__Howard You sure you're okay?
__Raj I'm okay.
__Howard You don't look okay.
__Penny Okay. And Sheldon really believes we're at a public swimming pool?
__Leonard He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we'd be floating around in, he didn't even question it.
__Amy Don't worry about that. I'm happy to take you to work.
__Sheldon Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can't have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.
__Amy It's nice they're getting exercise.
__Sheldon Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.
__Amy I'm sure he brought it.
__Sheldon No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.
__Amy He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it.
__Sheldon You're acting odd. Why?
__Amy I'm odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.
__Sheldon Tell me the truth.
__Amy Twenty eight.
__Amy Fifty six.
__Amy All right. Don't get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he's getting the surgery right now.
__Sheldon I see. Take me to Leonard.
__Amy Just go to work, he'll be fine.
__Sheldon Amy, he's my best friend, and if you don't take me, I'm going there anyway.
__Amy Fine. It's sweet that you care about him so much.
__Sheldon I do. And I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn't at his bedside to say I told you so.
__Penny We had a really nice swim.
__Sheldon Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre's already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.
__Penny ‘Cause I'm a liar, liar?
__Sheldon That's for the fire marshal to determine.
__Penny You had to tell him?
__Amy He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.
__Sheldon Is he okay?
__Penny He's still in surgery.
__Sheldon Very well.
__Penny He's gonna be all right. That is sticky.
__Amy Come on, let's talk about something other than the surgery.
__Sheldon That's a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?
__Penny I think she meant something a little happier.
__Sheldon I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.
__Bernadette Hi.
__Raj Hey. What brings you by?
__Bernadette Oh, muffin much.
__Howard Told you, not funny.
__Bernadette He's just not laughing because he's feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.
__Raj I'm sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.
__Howard So, how you doing?
__Raj Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.
__Bernadette Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.
__Howard Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.
__Bernadette Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off.
__Howard As you can see, we're here to cheer you up.
__Bernadette Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?
__Raj I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.
__Bernadette It's a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there's muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?
__Sheldon Oh, this isn't for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.
__Amy Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
__Sheldon You know those confounded things make me dizzy.
__Amy Who told you to keep going around?
__Sheldon There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.
__Penny Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don't give him a hard time.
__Amy Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you're thinking, just keep it to yourself.
__Sheldon It was like a grapefruit.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.
__Penny Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.
__Sheldon The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.
__Penny Really? You won't even say A?
__Sheldon You bet your sweet B I won't.
__Penny Obviously, I care about Leonard. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with him.
__Sheldon And I'm not? It's an earthquake. I knew it.
__Penny Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.
__Sheldon A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don't care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he's okay.
__Amy Sheldon, you can't go back there.
__Sheldon Try and stop me.
__Amy Are you okay?
__Sheldon Why didn't you stop me?
__Howard What are you talking about? We're fine. And Raj's parents probably split up because of Raj.
__Bernadette What?
__Howard They always say the children aren't to blame, but, come on.
__Bernadette I'm not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don't want that to happen to us.
__Howard How can I convince you it won't?
__Bernadette Well, is there anything about me you're keeping inside?
__Howard I'm not answering that. It's a trap.
__Bernadette So there are things you don't like.
__Howard And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I'm gonna chew my leg off.
__Bernadette Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won't get mad.
__Howard Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you're too beautiful.
__Bernadette Oh. Howie, be serious.
__Howard Okay, okay. I really don't like how your wings poke me when we sleep 'cause you're an angel.
__Bernadette Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.
__Howard I just don't think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…
__Bernadette Who were you in couples therapy with?
__Howard Not important.
__Bernadette Was it your mom?
__Howard Not important.
__Bernadette It was your mom.
__Howard Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.
__Bernadette Oh, that's so sweet. I want to do that.
__Howard All right.
__Bernadette Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.
__Howard Thank you. And I love that you're strong and independent.
__Bernadette And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.
__Howard I love that I'm kind of a slob around here, and you're okay with that.
__Bernadette Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you're okay with that.
__Howard See, I am. Isn't this great?
__Sheldon You know this is all your fault.
__Leonard How is it my fault?
__Sheldon I told you not to get the surgery.
__Leonard Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn't even want you there.
__Sheldon Wow. I don't know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I'm done speaking to you.
__Amy Don't be like that. You two need to talk this out.
__Penny Yeah, 'cause you sound really funny.
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.
__Sheldon Oh, you're hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I'm moving out.
__Leonard I never thought I'd say these words, but come on, nose spider.
__Penny Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you'll never leave him.
__Amy Sheldon will move out eventually.
__Penny Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.
__Sheldon I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.
__Leonard You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.
__Sheldon Yeah. Tell me those aren't the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you're a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.
__Howard I love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
__Bernadette I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.
__Howard And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It's like washing myself with a hamster.
__Raj Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.
__Bernadette Oh, how is she?
__Raj Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father's Mercedes on fire. So, what's up with you guys?
__Howard We're just saying all the things we love about each other.
__Sheldon Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It's the urn I was going to put you in.
__Penny Okay, that's morbid. Send it back.
__Sheldon I can't send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”
__Leonard That's funny. Boy, I'm gonna miss these painkillers.
__Penny Hey, why did you get two? I'm with stupid.
__Sheldon Oh, that one's mine.
__Amy I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
__Sheldon But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.
__Amy And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.
__Sheldon So as they say, all good things must come to an end.
__Amy After only 232 episodes.
__Sheldon 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
__Amy You said you weren't gonna bring that up.
__Sheldon And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I'm sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who's Wavin' ‘Em and Why?
__Amy That was a good one.
__Sheldon It was so good.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Doesn't Professor Abbott's family want any of this stuff?
__Leonard I don't think he had a family.
__Raj That's rough.
__Leonard I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box.
__Howard Makes you think. Oh, well.
__Leonard Hey. Hey, we're supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it's important.
__Howard I did. It's all outdated or disproved.
__Raj I don't know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.
__Howard Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.
__Leonard It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
__Howard Don't feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.
__Leonard That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.
__Howard That's intense.
__Howard Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.
__Raj Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he's dead, but try it. It's fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.
__Penny Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me and now's a little hug machine.
__Dan Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.
__Penny Aw.
__Dan Yes. Why don't you come over to my table.
__Penny I'll be right there. Bernadette's just parking the car.
__Dan Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.
__Penny Come on. She's not that bad.
__Dan Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.
__Penny I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the…
__Bernadette Hey, what are you talking about?
__Penny Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn't that right? Dan?
__Amy And, yes, even shed a tear or two.
__Sheldon Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn't get recorded.
__Amy How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
__Sheldon How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
__ Highlight 1
__ Crikey, what flag do we have today?
__Amy Australia, mate.
__ Highlight 2
__ And now it's time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.
__Kripke Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this.
__ Highlight 3
__ Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?
__Sheldon I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.
__Amy Then who did sew it, hmm?
__Sheldon Don't ask me. I'm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
__ Highlight 4
__ Fancy a dip, my dear?
__Amy I do.
__Sheldon Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.
__Amy Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.
__Sheldon No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.
__ Highlight 5
__ Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap.
__Howard Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?
__Raj Wrong, smarty-pants. It's Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.
__Leonard Look at these notebooks. They're full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.
__Howard Mmm. It's just columns of random numbers. Toss it.
__Leonard Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne?
__Raj Maybe he didn't know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.
__Leonard This has to mean something.
__Howard Well, there's no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn't be too hard to run the numbers and check.
__Leonard Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.
__Howard Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.
__Leonard Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.
__Howard Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.
__Raj Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
__Howard Oh, let's do that.
__Leonard Because you don't know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?
__Howard Yeah, I'm not even sure if it's the right word.
__Dan Seven.
__Bernadette Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.
__Penny I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.
__Bernadette Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.”
__Dan I need another drink.
__Bernadette What's his problem?
__Penny Oh, I don't know. Maybe he didn't like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.
__Bernadette Well, I didn't think you were supposed to say sissy anymore.
__Penny Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.
__Bernadette What? I'm, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.
__Penny Yes, but once in a while, people think you're a little mean.
__Bernadette Oh, yeah? You one of those people?
__Penny No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.
__Sheldon Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.
__LeVar Burton Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.
__Sheldon You do this, I delete your contact information.
__Sheldon While you watch me do it.
__LeVar Great. Happy to be back.
__Sheldon Well, since you're here, I'd like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think?  Hi. My name is George.
__LeVar Oh, hell, no.
__Sheldon You heard him, Leonard. No, it's not racist.
__Raj The doorman said this is the right building.
__Leonard I think if you're pulling up your pants, you're not a doorman.
__Man Who is it?
__Prof Sharpe Hold on. Can I help you?
__Leonard Hi. We're from the university. We're trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.
__Howard We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
__Leonard Any chance you know what it is?
__Prof Sharpe Yes, he was always working on this.
__Raj I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble's law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.
__Prof Sharpe It's the number of calories in a yoghurt. That's his food diary.
__Leonard Really?
__Prof Sharpe Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.
__Raj Does it work?
__Raj Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don't know.
__Prof Sharpe Sorry it's not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn't have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.
__Leonard So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?
__Prof Sharpe To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.
__Raj You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.
__Raj Well, you could be very frugal. I'm getting a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.
__Penny No. That's fine, but there's a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.
__Bernadette I did say that, didn't I?
__Penny Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.
__Bernadette Where? To Babies R Us?
__Penny You're doing it again.
__Bernadette Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.
__Penny Oh, come on, they don't hate you, all right? They're just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.
__Bernadette I think I'd rather go.
__Penny No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__Penny Even though your dress is ugly.
__Amy Take that, glass ceiling.
__Sheldon And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn't give it up for the world. Except for now, when I'm giving it up. Before I sign off, I'd, uh, I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It's good for times like this. Good night.
__Amy Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.
__Sheldon If you didn't press record…
__Amy I pressed it.
__Raj And we still don't know who framed him.
__Leonard I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
__Howard I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.
__Leonard That's a nice way of looking at it.
__Howard Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I'm covered.
__Leonard You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let's make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.
__Howard I love that.
__Raj Yeah, me, too.
__Leonard Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon's face.
__Raj Oh, well, that's the best part.
__Howard Oh, yeah.
__Dan Sure, go ahead.
__Bernadette Just want you to know I didn't mean to be rude about your grandson.
__Dan No, it's okay.
__Bernadette No, it's not. Penny told me that everyone's scared of me.
__Dan What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?
__Penny What?
__Bernadette No, she's right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I'm gonna be much more sensitive. I don't want anyone walking on eggshells around me.
__Dan Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I've been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.
__Bernadette No problem. When does that start?
__Dan Five months ago.
__Bernadette What?
__Dan Yeah.
__Bernadette Who's been paying for my coffee?
__Dan All of us.
__Penny Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
__Bernadette What else don't I know about?
__Penny Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?
__Bernadette Yeah?
__Penny That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
__Bernadette You're kidding.
__Bernadette I feel so bad.
__Penny Well, then, maybe you shouldn't have named her Wheelchair Kathy.
__Bernadette Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I'm just a monster.
__Dan But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.
__Bernadette No, I'm the worst. I'm a terrible person.
__Dan Come on, don't cry. It's okay.
__Bernadette It's not okay. How can I even work here anymore?
__Penny Because this company needs you.
__Dan It's fine. We don't mind paying for the coffee.
__Bernadette I can't let you do that.
__Dan Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.
__Bernadette I guess that would be all right.
__Penny See? You don't have to be mean to get what you want.
__Bernadette You're right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard How come you're up so late?
__Sheldon I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.
__Leonard Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career, and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.
__Sheldon It's not the same thing. I don't think you know how I feel at all.
__Leonard Sad?
__Sheldon Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.
__Leonard Yeah. What did they say?
__Sheldon Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can't take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.
__Leonard Congratulations.
__Sheldon Let's celebrate.
__Leonard Sheldon, that wasn't for you.
__Sheldon Oh, no, I'm not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.
__Sheldon You told me not to call, and I didn't know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.
__LeVar Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don't know why I didn't get a gate.
__Sheldon You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk about German flags. How do you feel about dressing up like a swastika?
__ Raj; Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.
__ You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.
__Penny You know what? That was almost on topic. I'm gonna say good job, Sheldon.
__Amy Wait, She-Hulk's a lawyer?
__Howard Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.
__Sheldon Yes, but she's the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she's an affirmative action hire.
__Raj Anyway, Dad's gonna be here in town, so I won't be able to do Christmas dinner this year.
__Amy If you're not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I'm happy to do it. You can even bring your father.
__Raj That would be nice.
__Amy I've always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.
__Sheldon Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I'm not going.
__Amy You're going.
__Sheldon Why do you hate me?
__Amy I don't hate you. I love you.
__Sheldon Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.
__Raj Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.
__Bernadette I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.
__Howard I agree.
__Leonard Why not?
__Penny Me, too.
__Raj You guys suck.
__Leonard Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
__Howard I know. If we were still single, we'd be tripping over all that booty.
__Leonard Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.
__Howard How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
__Leonard You shut the loading doors, right?
__Howard I thought you did.
__Leonard Do you know what a disaster this is?
__Howard You mean 'cause this room isn't supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?
__Leonard What do we do? Should we call someone?
__Howard And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.
__Leonard It's not a moth.
__Howard Don't yell at me. You're not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you're yelling.
__Leonard Okay, so if I remain calm, I'll get more gems like turn off the lights?
__Howard Great, we're turning on each other. That's just what the bird wants us to do.
__Dr Koothrappali Twenty hours.
__Penny Oh, that's rough.
__Dr Koothrappali Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don't pray for the plane to crash?
__Raj Can we please talk about anything else?
__Dr Koothrappali Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?
__Penny Oh, great. Everything's good.
__Dr Koothrappali I see you got engaged.
__Penny Yes, we did.
__Dr Koothrappali Let me tell you a story.
__Raj Dad.
__Dr Koothrappali Sorry. I'm sure you won't grow to hate each other.
__Raj Hey, Leonard. What's up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I'll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.
__Amy What's going on?
__Raj There's been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
__Dr Koothrappali You want me to come?
__Raj Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.
__Dr Koothrappali Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn't cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.
__Penny You're just gonna leave him here?
__Dr Koothrappali Relax, he says.
__Raj Yup. Bye.
__Sheldon Yeah, I appreciate the ride.
__Sheldon Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.
__Bernadette Maybe you'd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
__Sheldon My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.
__Bernadette Okay, new subject. Let's talk about presents. What did you get Amy?
__Sheldon Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.
__Bernadette Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.
__Sheldon Why should I? She knows that I don't like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.
__Bernadette She's just excited about the holidays.
__Sheldon Yes, and she's not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it's time I teach her a lesson.
__Bernadette How?
__Sheldon Hmm. It'd have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she's making me. Oh, I've got it. This is good.
__Bernadette What?
__Sheldon I'm going to buy her a present.
__Bernadette Yeah, you're gonna have to walk me through that.
__Sheldon With gift-giving, there's an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn't have one for me, she'll feel terrible.
__Bernadette Then you're both sad?
__Sheldon Yes. Maybe she'll feel so guilty, she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again.
__Bernadette So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
__Sheldon That's right. So stay on my good side, or I'll get you a little something, too.
__Leonard A Slim Jim?
__Howard It's all I could find. It'll work.
__Leonard Sure. If the pigeon's stoned or a trucker.
__Howard Okay, well, what's your plan?
__Leonard I told you my plan. Let's call Building Services and get help.
__Howard And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
__Leonard No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.
__Howard Why do you keep assuming it was me?
__Leonard Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.
__Howard Like when?
__Leonard What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali's dog, or almost drove off with that baby?
__Howard Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn't even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.
__Leonard Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.
__Howard Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
__Raj Hey, what's going on?
__Leonard Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
__Raj Should have put it in the bag first.
__Dr Koothrappali It's much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?
__Penny No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard, I'll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?
__Penny Like what?
__Amy Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.
__Penny Sorry. She's taken, too.
__Leonard And you found somebody you could push around?
__Raj Hey.
__Howard Stay out of this.
__Raj Okay.
__Howard You know, maybe I'm best friends with Raj because he doesn't think he's smarter than me.
__Raj Actually.
__Howard I said, stay out of it.
__Leonard No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.
__Howard Well, if you're so smart, you get the bird out.
__Raj No, you're the one who let him in.
__Howard How do you know it wasn't Leonard?
__Raj Come on.
__Sheldon No, it's not good enough. It has to be perfect.
__Bernadette I think the nicest gifts I've got from Howie show how well he knows me.
__Sheldon Hmm. Let's see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer's her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she's playing along.
__Bernadette Wow, you really do love her.
__Sheldon I do. Now, let's find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.
__Penny Certainly doesn't feel like it, does it?
__Dr Koothrappali You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.
__Penny Oh, I guess that's where Raj gets it from.
__Dr Koothrappali Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.
__Penny Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.
__Sheldon Correct.
__Santa Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
__Sheldon There's an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
__Santa Ho, ho. ho.
__Howard Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
__Leonard Do you want the fire extinguisher?
__Howard Yeah, I do.
__Leonard Great. Here you go.
__Howard Okay. One, two, three.
__Raj Uh, you have to take the pin out.
__Leonard You miss the blanket now, don't you?
__Howard On three. One, two, three.
__Raj What did you do?
__Howard It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
__Leonard Relax, it wasn't your fault.
__Howard Uh, maybe it's just stunned.
__Raj Dude, it's not breathing.
__Howard Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.
__Raj What do you mean, not again?
__Howard When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.
__Leonard Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.
__Howard Great. Do it.
__Leonard I'm not doing it. You killed him, you do it.
__Raj I'll do it.
__Howard No. I need to do it. This is on me.
__Leonard Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
__Raj Don't blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.
__Leonard Anything?
__Howard I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
__Leonard Wait, wait, his wing moved.
__Howard Oh, he blinked his eyes. He's alive.
__Raj It's a Christmas miracle.
__Howard I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I'll take it. Come on, little guy, let's get you outside. Get the curtain.
__Raj Someone should really close that loading door.
__Howard You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.
__Leonard No, we're both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.
__Raj Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they're just gonna blame the Indian guy.
__Leonard Hey. I'm sorry, we're still here. Is everything okay?
__Penny It's kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you'll be?
__Leonard I don't know. There's still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
__Penny Honey, it's Christmas Eve. Who even knows you're in there?
__Leonard No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.
__Penny So erase them and walk out.
__Leonard I can't do that.
__Howard Can't do what?
__Leonard She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon If you like raisins.
__Amy Thank you. And it's figs.
__Sheldon Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.
__Bernadette You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.
__Howard It smelled too much like blue jay.
__Dr Koothrappali Can I help you clean up?
__Amy Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you're good.
__Sheldon Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?
__Penny Oh, Sheldon, we didn't bring any.
__Leonard I thought you hate giving gifts.
__Sheldon Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.
__Amy You got me something?
__Sheldon Oh, not just something, no. It's from the heart, it's holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.
__Sheldon Of course it is. It's the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
__Amy No, I love it.
__Sheldon Oh, really? Well, how about now?  Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you.  And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let's never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.
__Amy Actually, I did get you something.
__Sheldon But what about our agreement?
__Amy Well, you got me something. Here.
__Sheldon Cookies?
__Amy They're your Meemaw's Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
__Sheldon They're perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
__Amy Merry Christmas, Sheldon.
__Sheldon I can't believe this. You're happy, I'm happy. Well, maybe a holiday that's all about giving isn't so… Get your hand out of that box.
__Penny Of course it is.
__Amy One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.
__Raj If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you're all crazy.
__Sheldon That's not true. Any colour's fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.
__Leonard Blue and yellow make green.
__Sheldon Well, then it's settled.
__Penny Hi. Ready to go?
__Sheldon Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.
__Amy Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.
__Sheldon Oh, no, we'll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.
__Leonard No.
__Penny Well, did you tell him that?
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny Did you say it out loud with words?
__Leonard No.
__Penny I don't want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.
__Amy I will literally race you to the car.
__Leonard No, no, no, come on, don't leave. Just try it.
__Penny No. We're always doing what you guys want. Just once, it'd be nice if you did something we wanted.
__Sheldon You want to be green?
__Leonard You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we're into.
__Penny Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director's commentary.
__Amy Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I'm banished to the kitchen.
__Penny Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we're all gonna do.
__Leonard You got it, you girls are in charge.
__Penny Thank you.
__Amy Sheldon?
__Sheldon Fine. Now that we're not playing, you can be green.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon And since you're green this time, I can be it next time.
__Penny All right, let's see. What's something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.
__Amy I actually can't. My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.
__Penny All right, well, what do you want to do?
__Amy There's a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.
__Penny Well, that's Wilshire's problem. Come on, you know, there, there's got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.
__Leonard Hang on, why do we have to hate it?
__Penny Three words, Doctor Who convention.
__Leonard I did not force you to go to that.
__Penny You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn't get beat up.
__Leonard I wasn't gonna get beat up.
__Penny You were, but somehow I held myself back.
__Sheldon You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.
__Leonard Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?
__Amy I actually can't go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.
__Penny Is there any part of your body that's normal?
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Will you please relax?
__Raj I can't take it, dude.
__Bernadette You okay?
__Raj No, I'm not okay. I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my skin.
__Bernadette I told you not to wax down there. It's itchy when it grows back.
__Raj I'm worried about the New Horizons space probe.
__Bernadette What's he talking about?
__Howard Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it's finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.
__Raj We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it's gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
__Howard Now we get to see him flip out because he's worried it was demolished by space ice.
__Raj Space ice is no joke. I can't even watch Frozen anymore.
__Sheldon Before you say yes, it's not the movie about the big dog.
__Penny How come we can't think of something we both want to do?
__Amy Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.
__Leonard Ah, interesting, we're being accused of making you do things you don't like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.
__Sheldon You should point out the hypocrisy of that.
__Leonard That's what I was doing.
__Sheldon Oh, that wasn't clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?
__Penny All right, keep thinking.
__Sheldon You're making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I'd hate that. Leonard?
__Leonard Well, yeah.
__Sheldon Well, then, it's settled?
__Amy What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.
__Penny It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.
__Sheldon Well, once again, it's what I do.
__Howard I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour…
__Raj Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?
__Howard A story can do two things.
__Raj Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.
__Howard You work in pharmaceuticals, don't you have anything you can give him?
__Bernadette All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won't help with his anxiety, but it's so strong, when he pees he'll fly around the room like he's got a jet pack.
__Raj I can't stop thinking about it.
__Bernadette You know, worrying won't have any effect on what happens.
__Raj I know.
__Howard Maybe you need to do something more productive.
__Raj Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.
__Raj Yes.
__Howard The man who crashed his stationary bike.
__Raj I didn't crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.
__Howard You happy? Now you can relax.
__Raj What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
__Sheldon That's easy for you to say. Your chair's not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that's a lot of panties.
__Amy You guys comfy? This might take a while.
__Sheldon I don't understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
__Penny No, you're right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.
__Sheldon They have a man there who understands my personal style.
__Penny Bye.
__Leonard Uh, I've got some bad news. There's no cell service in here.
__Leonard That's true.
__Sheldon I'll look them up. Son of a biscuit.
__Leonard Sheldon, it's fine.
__Sheldon No, it's not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi? I'm going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.
__Leonard Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.
__Sheldon Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it. I wonder how long we're gonna be stuck here.
__Leonard I don't know, but the girls do a lot for us. It's the least we can do.
__Sheldon Oh, that's true. I suppose it's only fair we make compromises.
__Leonard Look at you, being all mature.
__Sheldon I don't know why you're so surprised. If there's one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it's how to compromise.
__Leonard I, I'm sorry? You make compromises for me?
__Sheldon All the time.
__Leonard On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we're living?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should've, because everyone was laughing at you.
__Leonard That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
__Sheldon Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.
__Sheldon Uh, well, it's scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can't take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I'm practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.
__Howard I'm happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?
__Raj If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.
__Howard Buddy, trust me, you don't want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it's not all briskets and dreidels.
__Raj I meant a Hindu temple.
__Howard Oh. Okay. It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn't gonna rip my heart out.
__Raj Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.
__Howard You love that movie.
__Raj Yeah, it's pretty great.
__Howard I'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
__Raj Why?
__Howard Well, because I've known you for ten years and you've never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.
__Raj Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don't talk about it.
__Howard Yeah, but you're a scientist.
__Raj So?
__Howard So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you're counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?
__Raj That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?
__Howard No. There's also Apu from The Simpsons.
__Raj Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.
__Howard Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.
__Raj Actually there's no proof of that.
__Penny Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?
__Amy Sure.
__Penny Do I really force you to do things you don't want to?
__Amy Yeah, but it's okay.
__Penny How is it okay?
__Amy I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I'd do whatever they said. Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.
__Penny Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You're a different woman now. You're smart, you've got great friends, you've got a boyfriend, you're pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we're gonna do whatever you want.
__Amy Really?
__Penny Absolutely. You name it, we're doing it.
__Amy Basket weaving at the craft museum.
__Penny Well, you named it.
__Leonard Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
__Sheldon I wasn't done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.
__Leonard Because of you, I'm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I'm not allowed to whistle. I don't wear shoes that might squeak.
__Sheldon Well, you're a physicist, not a circus clown.
__Leonard Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.
__Sheldon Is that true?
__Leonard Yes, it's true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.
__Sheldon Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.
__Leonard You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It's exhausting.
__Sheldon You know what? You think you're so tolerant, but the truth is you're mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don't notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.
__Leonard Sheldon, I, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.
__Sheldon Well, I'm sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.
__Leonard Do you mean that?
__Sheldon Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.
__Leonard Come on, don't get upset.
__Sheldon I'm not upset. I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon It's okay.
__Leonard I'm not leaving your world. I'm just talking about living across the hall.
__Sheldon I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I'm aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.
__Leonard Buddy.
__Penny How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?
__Leonard Everything's fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
__Amy Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.
__Sheldon That's exactly what I told him.
__Penny Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard's not gonna move out until you're ready.
__Sheldon Well, what if you did it gradually?
__Sheldon How about one night and I let you whistle?
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon When I'm not home.
__Leonard You got it.
__Sheldon There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.
__Raj You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It's called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.
__Howard Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.
__Raj All right. Shall we?
__Howard Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?
__Raj Like what?
__Howard Like am I dressed okay?
__Raj Really? So every other place you've been, you thought this was fine?
__Howard I know you're under a lot of pressure, so I'm gonna let that pass.
__Raj Sorry. You're right. I'm so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it's okay. We're all part of an immense pattern, and though we can't understand it, we can be happy to know that it's, it's working its will through us.
__Howard That's nice.
__Raj Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we're all interconnected, and that's just a beautiful… Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn't hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog's hair just gave her bangs.
__Howard Raj.
__Raj You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
__Howard Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It's fine.
__Raj Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.
__Penny Don't tell Amy that. We'll be here every Sunday.
__Amy Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.
__Sheldon It's not a basket. It's a soldier's helmet from 16th century China.
__Amy Very nice.
__Leonard Yeah, it looks great.
__Sheldon I saw that.
__Penny I know. I'm really proud of Sheldon.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.
__Sheldon Sheldon (in Penny's living room): Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
__Sheldon Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Sheldon Okay. Go ahead.
__Leonard Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven't changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.
__Penny Uh, Bernadette's nickname for you is the virgin piña colada.
__Leonard Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
__Penny Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.
__Leonard Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her… and that's why you're the best roommate ever.
__Sheldon Aw, now I'm sad I didn't hear it.
__Penny So what do you need the headphones for?
__Sheldon Well, I've been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn't make protons decay. I'm hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I've got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.
__Penny Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?
__Leonard I don't want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.
__Penny Yeah, have fun.
__Sheldon Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.
__Penny And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.
__Leonard Bye.
__Sheldon Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay.  Proton decay. Proton decay.  Proton decay. Proton decay.
__Leonard Hey, we're home. Any progress?
__Sheldon How could there be, with these constant interruptions?
__Penny I love him, but if he's broken, let's not get a new one.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon I'm not going to work today. And would you like to know why?
__Leonard Ah, you're upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn't make a breakthrough, and now you're worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you're gonna sit around and sulk all day?
__Sheldon Like a big old baby.
__Leonard Call me if you need anything.
__Sheldon I've been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.
__Penny Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny Ugh!
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny Ugh!
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny Ugh, what?
__Sheldon You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.
__Penny Oh, I'm just doing this awful workout. I hate it.
__Sheldon Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.
__Penny I don't know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.
__Sheldon And to clarify?
__Penny The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
__Sheldon I'm not going. Would you like to know why?
__Penny Uh, you're sad about not getting anything done last night, so you're gonna sit around and pout about it?
__Sheldon Boy, I'm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.
__Leonard Sure.
__Howard It's called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I've heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.
__Raj Go ahead, make fun. You can't embarrass me, I've got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.
__Howard Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you're not in it.
__Raj I may not be liking this game so much.
__Leonard Cinnamon. Give me another one.
__Howard Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters.
__Leonard We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.
__Raj You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It's not strange.
__Leonard Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.
__Sheldon Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she's trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I've created too pleasant of an environment for myself.
__Howard What do you mean?
__Sheldon According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I'd like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.
__Howard Hold on. What's in it for us?
__Sheldon Well, I suppose…
__Howard Okay, we'll do it.
__Amy 33 seconds. Okay, that'll be our baseline.
__Sheldon You know, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.
__Amy It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
__Sheldon And his last meal was a food pellet? You're a monster.
__Amy All right, next, we're gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.
__Sheldon Very well. And good luck, I'm a pretty laid-back guy.
__Amy Ready? Begin. Why'd you pop it?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, I was aiming for your heart.
__Amy Look, I know you don't like it, but that's the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.
__Sheldon Who eats them horizontally?
__Amy My mother said that's how good girls do it.
__Sheldon Perhaps this was a waste of time.
__Amy Sheldon, you're a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I'm sure you'll find the breakthrough you've been looking for.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Amy And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?
__Sheldon Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…
__Amy Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.
__Sheldon Really? Oh, that's fantastic. Now, wait, they're dropping. Why are they dropping?
__Amy Because you're happy they're elevated.
__Sheldon Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.
__Howard Let's see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?
__Raj You know what? I think it's a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you're jealous of all my relationships.
__Howard Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn't want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you're so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.
__Leonard That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.
__Leonard So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj And you think that's going to help?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Howard Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.
__Sheldon Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I'll become more focused.
__Leonard Howard's right, that'll never work.
__Sheldon Stop fighting me on the premise. It's scientifically valid. I'm going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.
__Raj I don't think that's what you want at all.
__Sheldon Why, of course it's what I want. Why would I say it's what I want if it's not what I want?
__Leonard Because it is what you want, and it's not what you said.
__Sheldon I ask you for one simple thing, and you can't even do it.
__Howard Yes, we can.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, then do it.
__Howard Nah.
__Sheldon You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.
__Amy That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.
__Penny Yeah, clearly you haven't seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.
__Amy If I were going to Hawaii, I'd spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?
__Penny Really? Want to go to Hawaii?
__Sheldon Ladies?  Ladies?  Ladies?
__Penny Come in.
__Sheldon Ladies.
__Penny What's up?
__Sheldon Well, as you may know, I've been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?
__Penny What exactly do you think goes on here?
__Sheldon Well, conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men's buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.
__Bernadette We were talking about Penny's job.
__Sheldon And how difficult it is to do when she's bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.
__Penny Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.
__Sheldon You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?
__Penny Let's just talk about our periods.
__Amy No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn't a werewolf have the same abilities?
__Bernadette Well, they're not a hundred percent wolf. They're a werewolf, that's only part wolf. It's like comparing apples to oranges.
__Sheldon Thank you. Oh, and technically, it's apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren't all PMS'ing. Bye.
__Sheldon Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I'm using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla's roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.
__Leonard Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I'm trying to sleep. Good night.
__Sheldon Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
__Sheldon Of course.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Amy Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
__Amy Fine. How was your day?
__Sheldon Oh, you said it.
__Amy Sheldon. Sheldon, I'm worried about you. You're not eating, you haven't slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.
__Sheldon I know. It's replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.
__Penny Say the quote again.
__Howard It's just so perfect that we're both Libras.
__Penny Wow, this is hard. I'm gonna say Cinnamon.
__Howard Yes.
__Penny Yes.
__Raj Come on.
__Howard That was the last one, I promise. We won't play any more.
__Raj Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.
__Bernadette Emily's feelings?
__Raj Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where's Sheldon?
__Penny Date night.
__Leonard That can't be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.
__Bernadette What happened?
__Leonard He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
__Bernadette Don't you think you should make him stop all this?
__Howard I don't know, he's not really hurting anybody.
__Leonard You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
__Sheldon He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
__Raj Wow, if he cracks that it's a game changer, guys. It'll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.
__Howard Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?
__Sheldon That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that'd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.
__Amy I'm sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.
__Sheldon There you go, perfect.
__Amy Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.
__Sheldon But after months of struggling, I'm finally making progress.
__Amy You don't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
__Sheldon Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.
__Amy That's not true.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I have been hallucinating lately.
__Amy Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.
__Sheldon Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?
__Amy Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.
__Sheldon Hmm, perhaps. But I'm not taking the cap off.
__Amy It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I'm telling you for the last time, take the cap off.
__Sheldon Oh, really? What if I don't? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?
__Sheldon I knew you'd understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.
__Leonard Here we are.
__Sheldon Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn't in here.
__Leonard You lie down, he'll be here in a minute.
__Sheldon Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.
__Penny Now, you just get comfortable.
__Leonard Maybe in the morning.
__Penny Yeah, you get some sleep.
__Sheldon No, I don't want to go to sleep, you can't make me.
__Sheldon Yeah, darn straight, you can't. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.
__Penny Soft kitty, warm kitty.
__Leonard Little ball of fur.
__Sheldon That's not gonna work.
__Penny Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.
__Together Purr, purr, purr.
__Leonard You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.
__Penny Mmmm.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm feeling much better. And I've also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.
__Leonard I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.
__Raj Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Howard Yeah, no problem.
__Sheldon Of course not.
__Emily So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.
__Emily Well, you may think it's funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it's sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?
__Leonard Wow, you remember that?
__Penny Yeah, I listen to what you say. You're building a particle detector using superfluid helium.
__Leonard You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.
__Penny And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how's the detector going?
__Leonard Well, it's tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.
__Penny Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.
__Leonard Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?
__Penny No, I do. I didn't write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.
__Leonard Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there's a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…
__Penny Hey, if you're pausing for dramatic effect, I'd keep it moving.
__Leonard No, no. People don't talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.
__Penny Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.
__Sheldon Hmm.
__Leonard What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?
__Sheldon Hmm.
__Leonard I know this isn't my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?
__Sheldon Well, you could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can't stand these scented markers.
__Leonard No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?
__Sheldon It's good.
__Leonard Really?
__Sheldon I like it. I think you're on to something.
__Leonard You do? You're not messing with me?
__Sheldon Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.
__Leonard You're giving me a sticker?
__Sheldon Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
__Leonard I'm not a preschooler.
__Sheldon Fine, I'll take it back.
__Leonard I earned this. Back off.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you're still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.
__Leonard You worked out all the math.
__Sheldon Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.
__Leonard You wrote a paper on my idea?
__Sheldon I wrote a paper on our idea.
__Leonard When did my idea become our idea?
__Sheldon When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.
__Leonard This is good. Our idea is really good.
__Sheldon Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.
__Leonard You know, if no one's thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.
__Sheldon Only way we'll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn't gonna do it without you.
__Leonard Wow, it's all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?
__Sheldon We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.
__Leonard You're sure it's good?
__Sheldon My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.
__Leonard Okay, partner, let's do it.
__Sheldon Come on. Click the mouse with me.
__Leonard One, two three.
__Together Click.
__Leonard Well, we did it.
__Sheldon Yes, we did, my friend.
__Leonard Is your tongue blue?
__Amy Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
__Penny Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.
__Bernadette Search for it.
__Penny What, no, why?
__Bernadette ‘Cause it would be fun to watch.
__Penny It would be humiliating.
__Amy They have it.
__Bernadette Please, can we watch it?
__Amy Please?
__Penny Fine, but I'm telling you, it's terrible.
__Amy Have you even seen it?
__Penny No.
__Bernadette Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.
__Voice on TV Bananas, get your fresh bananas.
__Bernadette Ho-ho, it really didn't.
__Sheldon Does it smell like blueberries?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Then we're probably okay.
__Howard Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.
__Leonard Really? What'd they say?
__Howard Uh, it's basically a summary of the theory, but there's a bunch of positive comments on the message board.
__Leonard Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We're insightful and innovative.
__Sheldon Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
__Leonard Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?
__Sheldon I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.
__Howard How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?
__Raj Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.
__Sheldon Read another one.
__Leonard Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.
__Sheldon Who wrote that?
__Leonard It's anonymous, and user name General Relativity.
__Sheldon Well, I'm responding to it.
__Leonard Uh, don't lower yourself to their level.
__Sheldon Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.
__Leonard Sheldon, my name's on that paper, too. There's no upside to doing this.
__Sheldon He just left another comment.
__Raj What does it say?
__Leonard Upon review, I've changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it's inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.
__Sheldon Can I respond now?
__Leonard Do it.
__Sheldon You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I'm about to show this guy just how horny I can be.
__Leonard Somebody else do it.
__Penny Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.
__Penny Okay, we've seen plenty.
__Bernadette No, give me the remote.
__Amy Careful. She'll bite your fingers off.
__Penny Okay, well, I've been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we'll enjoy watching even more.
__Amy What is it?
__Penny Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.
__Amy What?
__Bernadette Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.
__Amy I haven't learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.
__Bernadette Hi. I'm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.
__Penny You look like a talking cupcake.
__Amy Play it again. Play it again.
__Sheldon Hmm. No, not yet.
__Leonard Well, maybe we shouldn't have sunk to his level.
__Howard It wasn't that bad.
__Leonard Read it back one more time.
__Sheldon My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.
__Leonard And you don't think that's too rough?
__Sheldon We're just standing behind her. It's not like we're gonna say boo and scare her.
__Bernadette ‘Cause it's embarrassing.
__Penny It is; it truly is.
__Bernadette Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.
__Penny No.
__Amy Why? What did I do?
__Bernadette Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.
__Penny Okay. We are reading that right now.
__Amy No, please don't.
__Bernadette We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.
__Amy But it's personal.
__Penny Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?
__Amy No.
__Penny Oh, my God, it's about her and Sheldon.
__Amy It's not about me and Sheldon. It's about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.
__Penny Please show us?
__Bernadette Please?
__Amy No.
__Penny You know I'm gonna read it either way.
__Amy Good luck finding it.
__Penny Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.
__Bernadette Why? Why did it feel different?
__Penny Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.
__Amy You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I'm starting to miss that.
__Leonard Do you really want him to write back?
__Sheldon Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?
__Leonard Me-wow.
__Howard What are you doing?
__Raj I've, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.
__Howard This wee li'l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.
__Raj No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li'l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
__Sheldon He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?
__Howard Yes.
__Raj Guys, this person's just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.
__Sheldon Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.
__Raj Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.
__Howard Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.
__Raj See? Better with the accent.
__Sheldon And send.
__Leonard What did you write?
__Sheldon I'm done hiding from bullies. I'm taking this into the real world.
__Leonard What does that mean?
__Sheldon I told him we'll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.
__Leonard Are you crazy? You don't know who this person is. Delete that.
__Raj Come on, Sheldon!
__Sheldon Oh, okay, okay, calm down.  It's him. He's trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn't have taken this into the real world.
__Leonard Oh, really?
__Bernadette Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon's kind of exhausting.
__Amy He's like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It's called good writing. And wishful thinking.
__Penny It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.
__Bernadette Here we go.
__Penny Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.
__Bernadette Oh, Amelia.
__Penny So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.
__Amy In the 1800s that was considered flirting.
__Howard Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they'd never say to your face.
__Sheldon Interesting. I can't think of a single thing I wouldn't say to someone's face.
__Leonard Never noticed that about you.
__Raj You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people's work.
__Sheldon He's right. I say we call this person back. We've got no reason to hide.
__Leonard All right, do it. Call him. Let's find out what this loser's ever accomplished.
__Sheldon Click it with me. One, two, three, click.
__Stephen Hawking Well, hello there.
__Sheldon Professor Hawking?
__Stephen Hawking Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.
__Leonard You really didn't like our paper?
__Stephen Hawking I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.
__Sheldon Then why are you attacking us?
__Stephen Hawking If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you'd get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.
__Leonard Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
__Sheldon Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.
__Leonard And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.
__Howard How do you do, Mr. I'll-Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?
__Raj Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.
__Bernadette Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
__Amy Okay, that's enough.
__Penny What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.
__Amy You're just making fun of me.
__Bernadette I was just kidding. I'm sorry. And the story's really good.
__Penny No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?
__Bernadette Please?
__Amy Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia's eyes. He took her hand in his and said, “I can't stay, but I will never forget you.” He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “Please don't go,” she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.
__Bernadette But they didn't even kiss.
__Amy She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn't bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.
__Penny Yes.
__Amy “What about the future?” asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “There is no future without you.” He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath…
__Leonard You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.
__Penny Get out!
__Cooper Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it's a little nippy.
__Amelia I can fix that. I couldn't help but notice your unusual undergarments.
__Cooper They're not undergarments. They're Underoos. Where I come from, they're known as underwear that's fun to wear.
__Amelia And what's the significance of the spider?
__Cooper Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.
__Amelia There's a lot of rhyming in the future, isn't there?
__Leonard You're right. This is even weirder than I thought.
__Penny You want me to stop reading?
__Leonard Are you kidding? No, no.
__Penny As he stood for Amelia to dry him…
__Amelia So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?
__Amy Sure.
__Sheldon How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
__Amy How many?
__Sheldon Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke.
__Amy Is that really true?
__Sheldon Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.
__Barry Hey, sowwy to intewupt.
__Sheldon Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
__Barry Did you know Edison didn't actuawy invent the wight bulb?
__Sheldon What do you want, Barry?
__Barry Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.
__Amy What's this for?
__Barry Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper's onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.
__Amy Well, that's fascinating. I can't wait to read it.
__Sheldon Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.
__Barry Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.
__Sheldon Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?
__Amy Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it's not a big deal.
__Sheldon Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn't you try to help me?
__Amy I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.
__Sheldon That's pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn't mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.
__Amy Sheldon, we're all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You're being petty.
__Sheldon I'm being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?
__ Credits sequence.
__Bernadette Your mom having fun in Florida?
__Howard Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.
__Bernadette She's just being nice.
__Howard Well, I'm her son, how come she doesn't send someone to check on me if I'm lonely?
__Bernadette Because you have a wife.
__Howard Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.
__Bernadette I know you don't like Stuart being in the house, but the store's about to reopen, I'm sure he'll get back on his feet.
__Howard That would be great. I'd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.
__Bernadette Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny You okay?
__Sheldon If I was okay, I would've said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.
__Penny What's going on?
__Sheldon I'm mad at Amy.
__Penny Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?
__Sheldon No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.
__Penny Oh, that sounds like a good thing.
__Sheldon Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I'm sorry you had to see that.
__Penny I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.
__Sheldon Why would she do this to me?
__Penny Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose. Besides, aren't you the one who says there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?
__Sheldon No, I said there's nothing more important than me advancing science.
__Penny All right, well, if I'm understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.
__Sheldon Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it's my fault, and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.
__Penny I don't know what to tell you. I mean, why don't you talk to her?
__Sheldon Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life's giving me lemons. What should I do?
__Penny Well, you could shove them somewhere.
__Sheldon Okay, now you're getting creative.
__Leonard No problem.
__Raj Our pleasure.
__Leonard The place really looks great.
__Raj Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.
__Stuart I keep telling you I didn't burn it down.
__Leonard We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.
__Bernadette Stuart, this place looks amazing.
__Stuart Thanks.
__Howard You really did a nice job.
__Stuart And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom's through all this. I couldn't have done it otherwise.
__Stuart Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn't it look great?
__Howard Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.
__Bernadette Howie.
__Stuart What is your problem? She said it was okay.
__Howard Well, I'm her son, and I say it's not okay.
__Stuart Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.
__Howard Well, maybe I should've gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy's mother.
__Bernadette Why don't we leave so you can cool off?
__Stuart I think that's a good idea. Take him out of my store.
__Howard Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I'm not going anywhere.
__Leonard Why don't we go get the food for the party.
__Stuart Thank you.
__Raj Smart, looks like we're being helpful.
__Leonard Mmm, when really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation.
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?
__Penny I don't know, just think about something else.
__Sheldon Can I think about the spiny anteater?
__Penny Sure.
__Sheldon The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn't help at all.
__Penny You know, some people try visualization.
__Sheldon How does that work?
__Penny Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Penny Now imagine you're holding that pen.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Penny Now open your hand and let it go.
__Sheldon But I just got this pen. It's got my initials on it and everything. Look.
__Penny Sheldon, this isn't that hard.
__Sheldon I may have a better way that you can teach me.
__Penny How?
__Sheldon What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?
__Penny What? She didn't give me any puzzles.
__Amy Boy, I just can't seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?
__Amy Darn it. There's something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?
__Amy Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.
__Penny Son of a bitch.
__Sheldon Okay, that's great. Now, let it go.
__Penny I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp.
__Sheldon Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.
__Penny Why would she even do this?
__Sheldon She's been conducting an experiment on apes where they're given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them. That's when Amy said, want to make this interesting?
__Penny Make this interesting? You bet money on me?
__Sheldon No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn't that interesting?
__Penny It's not interesting. It's incredibly insulting.
__Sheldon Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you're holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that'll make the next part really hard.
__Penny Oh, my, that's it. Get out.
__Penny Get out.
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny What?
__Sheldon I think I left my pen in there.
__Howard It's my mom's furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.
__Bernadette Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother's house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.
__Howard That is a good point. But I didn't marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I'm being.
__Waitress Sure, let me go check on that.
__Raj Dude, I, I think that's Nathan Fillion.
__Leonard Oh yeah, look at that.
__Raj And he's picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.
__Leonard We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.
__Raj No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart's store, that would be amazing.
__Leonard That would be great.
__Raj So should we go talk to him?
__Leonard I don't know. I mean, if he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.
__Raj What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.
__Leonard He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
__Raj I was distracted. It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don't mean to bother you, but we're just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.
__Nathan Fillion Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I'm not an actor.
__Raj Don't say that. I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench, but you're pretty great.
__Nathan Fillion Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I'm Nathan Fillion, but I'm not. So if you don't mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.
__Leonard Come on. Sorry to bother you.
__Raj Don't know why he's so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I'm still floating.
__Penny Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I'll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.
__Amy What are you talking about?
__Penny I know you've been giving me secret puzzle tests.
__Amy Sheldon, open the door.
__Sheldon I can't. I'm naked.
__Amy I just saw you.
__Sheldon Hang on.
__Penny Open the door now.
__Amy Oh, hey.
__Penny Pull up your pants.
__Amy It's not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.
__Penny I don't want five dollars. I want my dignity.
__Amy So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?
__Raj Thanks.
__Leonard Sorry again.
__Nathan Fillion No problem.
__Raj Are you sure you're not him? Uh, you can tell us. We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.
__Nathan Fillion All right, fine. I'm him.
__Nathan Fillion I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let's take a picture.
__Leonard That would be great.
__Raj Great.
__Leonard Yeah, thank you.
__Nathan Fillion You bet.
__Raj Wait, hang on. If you're really Nathan Fillion, what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?
__Leonard That's it, that's the line.
__Raj Although, I knew the line, doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.
__Nathan Fillion Do you want the picture or not?
__Raj I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.
__Nathan How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?
__Leonard What do you think?
__Raj Ah, it's good enough for Facebook.
__Penny I know, it's so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.
__Leonard Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.
__Penny Unbelievable.
__Leonard And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.
__Penny Really? You couldn't get it out?
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Amy Wow, the store looks great.
__Leonard So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?
__Penny Eh, what's the matter with them is they think they're so smart they don't care if they hurt other people's feelings.
__Amy That's not true.
__Sheldon That sounds like us. I still don't understand why you're upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
__Amy Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.
__Howard I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.
__Bernadette Can you please just let it go?
__Sheldon Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.
__Howard Hold that thought.  Hello?
__Amy How can I make this up to you?
__Penny The answer's in this puzzle box. Let's see if you can open it.
__Stuart You could have at least warned him about the furniture.
__Raj That's what I said when we moved it.
__Bernadette You helped him?
__Raj No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.
__Leonard Hey, you okay?
__Howard No.
__Leonard What's wrong?
__Howard My mom died.
__Bernadette What?
__Howard Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.
__Leonard I'm so sorry.
__Raj What can we do?
__Howard I don't know.
__Sheldon May I say something?
__Leonard Not right now, Sheldon.
__Sheldon But I think it would be comforting.
__Leonard Buddy.
__Howard No, it's okay. What?
__Sheldon When I lost my own father, I didn't have any friends to help me through it. You do.
__Penny I really thought he was gonna say let it go.
__Penny How's Howard holding up?
__Raj He's hanging in there.
__Leonard How are you doing, Stuart?
__Amy One of us would have taken you in.
__Stuart Yeah, I don't recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I'm glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.
__Raj Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.
__Penny Whenever I saw her, she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.
__Amy She did that to me, too.
__Penny Don't take this away from me.
__Sheldon I didn't care for her yelling. But now that I'm not going to hear it again, I'm sad.
__Leonard If you want, I can yell at you later.
__Sheldon It won't be as good.
__Leonard Let's have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We'll miss you.
__Leonard That doesn't sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.
__Penny Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.
__Raj Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you're talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.
__Amy And then they finish it off by staring into each other's eyes for four minutes.
__Sheldon Oh, that's nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.
__Amy Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.
__Penny Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?
__Raj What? I don't need science to win her heart. I have my family's wealth for that.
__Leonard I'm telling you, you can't create love in a few hours. Right?
__Penny Oh, careful. You're poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.
__Sheldon Yeah, but we don't have to debate this. We're scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…
__Amy No.
__Amy Forget it.
__Raj Why don't you just do the test?
__Sheldon In the interest of science, I'd be willing to.
__Penny What? You're okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Please, can I do it with him? Please?
__Leonard I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you're it.
__Raj Yeah, but what if the experiment works?
__Penny I'm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.
__Amy That's what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.
__Sheldon Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.
__Leonard In love yet?
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.
__Sheldon Okay, babe, let's do this.
__Amy Why?
__Raj Well, even if the study's nonsense, I don't believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn't use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn't know karate, but why risk it?
__Amy I think we're safe.
__Leonard Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?
__Amy The two of us could do it.
__Leonard Yeah, sure, that might be fun.
__Amy What's the first question?
__Raj Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?
__Leonard Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.
__Leonard I'm in love. Let's do something else.
__Raj Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don't the four of us go out?
__Leonard Okay.
__Amy Sounds good.
__Leonard Should we call Howard and Bernadette?
__Raj I don't know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.
__Amy Did he say anything about the funeral?
__Raj Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.
__Baggage Clerk No, I'm just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.
__Howard All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,
__ first, I meant first.
__ I just need some information. Uh, what's the flight number?
__Bernadette Eight sixteen.
__Howard I really did mean first.
__Bernadette Just drop it.
__Clerk And can you describe the bag?
__Bernadette Um, well, it's, uh, black. There's a red ribbon tied to the handle.
__Howard The world's greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.
__Penny Yup. Be right there. I assume you don't want wine.
__Sheldon Correct. You're not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
__Penny What heavy machinery? Let's just start.
__Sheldon Well, as a Texas gentleman, I'm inclined to say ladies first. Although, I'm concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you're familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…
__Penny Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?
__Sheldon Hmm. Living or dead?
__Penny Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.
__Penny You sure that's your choice? ‘Cause I've had that dinner.
__Sheldon Well, I haven't. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don't see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?
__Penny Robert Downey, Jr.
__Sheldon Oh, I didn't think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.
__Amy Well, we're the ones tagging along, you pick.
__Emily Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?
__Leonard What's that?
__Emily Um, it's kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There's one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.
__Penny Uh, well, I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.
__Sheldon That's it?
__Penny Yeah, why?
__Sheldon You didn't mention Leonard.
__Penny He's there.
__Sheldon I don't think so. Leonard can't stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.
__Penny Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What's yours?
__Sheldon Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.
__Penny Interesting, you didn't mention Amy.
__Sheldon Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?
__Leonard Ladies?
__Emily Are you being polite or scared?
__Leonard Yup.
__Emily Ah, what a room!
__Amy Oh.
__Leonard This is cool.
__Amy So, how do we start?
__Emily We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.
__Raj Uh, wasn't there supposed to be a zombie?
__Zombie Uuuuuuuh!
__Raj Ooh. Okay, let's hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.
__Bernadette So, where is it?
__Clerk I don't know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?
__Howard So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you're telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?
__Clerk I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could've gotten on an international flight.
__Howard Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you've narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.
__Clerk I'm sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.
__Penny Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.
__Sheldon I don't think you're taking this seriously.
__Penny Come on, I'm just having some fun with you.
__Sheldon I believe what you're doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
__Penny Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.
__Sheldon Ha. Keep dreaming.
__Penny Sheldon.
__Shedon I'm sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that's how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people's minds.
__Penny Well, I can't read people's minds. Actually, that's not true, I can read men's minds, but only 'cause it's usually the one thing.
__Sheldon When are we going to get robot eyes?
__Penny You're all alike.
__Sheldon Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can't always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they're mad at something I've done or just in a bad mood. It, it's incredibly stressful.
__Penny Really? You always seem so confident.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not. And if I could read people's minds, life would be so much simpler.
__Penny Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.
__Sheldon You sure it's not too much Bible juice?
__Penny And the wave is gone.
__Amy Keep it down, we're working here.
__Raj Okay, we've got the cipher decoded.
__Emily How's it going with the globe?
__Amy We used the coordinates to locate the cities.
__Leonard I'm putting the city names in the grid now. I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.
__Zombie Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!
__Leonard Yup. Got the code.
__Zombie Just saying, no refund for finish early!
__Howard No, I'm not leaving without her.
__Bernadette All right, we'll wait.
__Howard I could've driven her.
__Bernadette What?
__Howard The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.
__Bernadette There's no way you could've known. Be right back. Excuse me?
__Bernadette You better find my husband's mother 'cause one way or another, w e're walking out of this airport with a dead woman.
__Raj Uh, Origin of Species.
__Leonard Here it is. There's a black light.
__Emily Oh, hang on.
__Raj Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man's father is my father's son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.
__Amy Well, if I don't have a brother, my father's son is me. And if I'm this man's father, then he's my son. The answer's son.
__Emily Ooh. There's a picture of the sun over there.
__Leonard I bet the key's behind it.
__Zombie Could be somewhere else.
__Emily Oh, got the key.
__Amy So, that's the key to the door? That's it?
__Leonard We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?
__Raj It's like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.
__Emily Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.
__Amy Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.
__Zombie Remember that before you post on Yelp.
__Sheldon So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there's something satisfying about dying on my birthday.
__Penny Today's your birthday?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Well, that's always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.
__Sheldon Well, I don't enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director's Cut.
__Penny So, why did you finally tell me?
__Sheldon The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
__Penny Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won't tell anyone.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.
__Sheldon You're making it difficult to love you right now.
__Howard Oh, thank God. It's okay, she's here. Ma's here.
__Bernadette Okay, thank you so much.
__Howard Ma? I'm sorry I didn't take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I'll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
__Bernadette Oh, no. That thing's gonna end up in my bedroom.
__Penny All that's left to do is stare into each other's eyes for four minutes without talking.
__Sheldon Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We're good to go.
__Penny You ready?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny And begin. This is kind of creepy.
__Sheldon We're not supposed to talk during this part.
__Penny Sorry.
__Sheldon This is kind of creepy.
__Penny Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.
__Sheldon Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I'm just concentrating on that. Plus, it's easier around people that I'm comfortable with.
__Penny Aw, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.
__Sheldon Of course you are, I'm warm and soothing. I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.
__Penny It's getting creepy again.
__Sheldon What?
__Penny Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.
__Sheldon It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.
__Penny Can you believe it's been eight years?
__Sheldon Yeah, and you're still eating our food.
__Penny I can't remember a time you guys weren't in my life.
__Sheldon I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you're interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.
__Penny That's it. That wasn't so bad.
__Penny Well, maybe. But I'm still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.
__Sheldon And I, you. And yes, that's how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I'd say we have some hard choices to make.
__Penny Like what?
__Sheldon Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?
__Sheldon Well, this is me. It's been a very interesting evening.
__Penny It really has.
__Sheldon Aah! And after I let you be Gary.
__Penny Again, it was miniature golf.
__Leonard Admit it, you're a little turned on.
__Penny You can't be this proud.
__Leonard Why not?
__Penny Because I beat you.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Hi.
__Sheldon Oh, good. You're back.
__Amy We have some exciting news.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.
__Penny Okay.
__Amy After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.
__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon Do you want to say it?
__Amy Let's say it together.
__Together We're getting a turtle.
__Penny This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
__Sheldon Sarcasm?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Okay. That was tricky, 'cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.
__Leonard Well, we're, we're very happy for you.
__Penny Yes.
__Amy Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
__Sheldon No. It's true. It means that we care so much about each other, there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.
__Leonard Why a turtle?
__Sheldon After much deliberation, we've determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don't shed fur, they don't make noise.
__Amy For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.
__Sheldon Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that's also why I chose you as a roommate.
__Leonard Well, congratulations. Who would've thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Amy That's what I said.
__ Credits sequence.
__Emily Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she's always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.
__Raj But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.
__Emily And the more important thing to remember is that I'd never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.
__Raj That's okay. I can come back later.
__Emily No. No, don't be silly. I won't be gone long. Just stay here.
__Raj Okay, cool. Oh, and you're sure your roommate's not gonna come back while I'm here alone, right? ‘Cause that'll be awkward.
__Emily Oh, don't worry. She's in Palm Springs.
__Raj Oh, good.
__Emily Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.
__Amy It's okay. You made it. We're fine.
__Sheldon That was a lot of puppies.
__Amy Let's forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?
__Sheldon Oh, I don't know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?
__Amy Well, he's barely moving. He looks half dead.
__Sheldon I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How'd you like to come home with us? You'll be living with me because we don't live in the same house.
__Amy But that's not your fault. Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow. You'll stay with me when he's at Comic-Con or away for work.
__Sheldon Or if they accept Daddy's application to live on Mars.
__Amy What are you talking about?
__Sheldon Oh, there's this company that's attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.
__Amy You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn't be bothered to tell me?
__Sheldon Would you have approved?
__Amy Of course not.
__Sheldon Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn't that right, Giuseppe?
__Penny Aw, is this your first time?
__Leonard No, I got you something for Valentine's Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.
__Penny Well, why?
__Leonard Well, 'cause I got it at the dirty store.
__Penny You went to the dirty store without me?
__Leonard In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
__Penny Well, get it. Get it for me.
__Leonard Yeah?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Okay, uh, well, I hope it's fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it's kind of creative and artistic.
__Penny Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?
__Leonard No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.
__Penny Whoa, that's kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.
__Leonard You're making fun of me. Forget it.
__Penny No. No, come on, I want to do it.
__Leonard Really?
__Penny Yeah, let's you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.
__Leonard Okay, but it's a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.
__Bernadette Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.
__Howard Those are business expenses. You can write those off.
__Bernadette A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?
__Howard Oh, Bernie, you're gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.  Hey, what's up?
__Raj Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I'm just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?
__Howard Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.
__Raj What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?
__Howard She doesn't have to, I filled up on jelly beans.
__Raj So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.
__Howard What's wrong?
__Raj I can't get Emily's night-stand to close.
__Howard So?
__Raj She's gonna know I was looking in it.
__Howard Why were you looking in it?
__Raj Well, there's a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.
__Howard Okay, calm down. There's probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what's there.
__Raj Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.
__Howard You know what, you sound busy, I'm gonna let you go.
__Raj Dude, the whole front came off. Now she's gonna know I was snooping.
__Howard Raj was snooping through Emily's drawers and broke one.
__Bernadette Aw. I'm gonna miss her.
__Leonard I thought it'd be a little more, just more.
__Penny I'm not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?
__Leonard Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.
__Leonard Uh, Th, that's true. How late did we stay up last night?
__Penny Almost 1am.
__Leonard Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren't even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.
__Penny Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.
__Leonard Yeah. You get the paint, I'll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.
__Amy No one told you to poke the turtle's face.
__Sheldon I was playing Got Your Nose. That's how you get children to like you.
__Amy I'm surprised you even care if he likes you, since you're planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.
__Sheldon Ugh, this again. Amy, I've already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don't need another one.
__Amy Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.
__Sheldon Huh, that's exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.
__Amy And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.
__Sheldon First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.
__Amy You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
__Sheldon What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
__Amy Please don't.
__Sheldon Yep, you're mad.
__Raj Hang on.
__Howard Well, I think you broke the dowels. You're not gonna have time to glue it back on, you'll have to nail it.
__Howard Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
__Raj She does.
__Howard Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
__Raj Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
__Amy Why do you even want to do this?
__Sheldon Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?
__Amy Can't you just tell me?
__Sheldon But I made a video.
__Sheldon I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I'm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can't take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
__Leonard You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
__Sheldon Yes. Open it and check.
__Leonard I don't get it. There's actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
__Sheldon Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.
__Penny How did you get paint in your eye?
__Leonard Because you wouldn't let me wear safety goggles.
__Howard It's fine. You just need two more nails.
__Raj Okay, where should I put them?
__Howard In Emily's eyes.
__Raj You're not helping.
__Bernadette Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.
__Raj You know, it, it's bad enough that I have to deal with this…
__Emily Raj? I'm back.
__Raj Oh, no. Hey.
__Emily Hi.
__Raj How was the hospital?
__Emily Fine. What were you doing in there?
__Raj Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don't want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.
__Emily You were looking in my night stand?
__Raj Yeah.
__Emily So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?
__Raj You've never snooped around my apartment?
__Emily No.
__Raj Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.
__Emily I can't believe you don't trust me.
__Bernadette She sounds really mad.
__Bernadette Yeah, we should.
__Howard But we're not going to, are we?
__Bernadette Not a chance.
__Howard What happened to snooping is wrong?
__Bernadette Howard, you're going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?
__Penny We sure did.
__Leonard I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.
__Penny Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.
__Penny What? Are you kidding? We're not hanging it.
__Leonard But it's an expression of our love.
__Penny And our butts. Not hanging it.
__Leonard Seems a shame to throw it away.
__Penny Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.
__Leonard God, I love you. I love you so much.
__Sheldon Why? I really don't understand what's happening here.
__Amy You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.
__Sheldon Amy. Oh, why didn't I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.
__Amy Sure. Unless something better comes along.
__Sheldon Do you want me to withdraw my application?
__Amy What I want is for us to be planning our future together.
__Sheldon And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I've seen people make the long-distance thing work.
__Amy We're on the same planet.
__Sheldon Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
__Amy Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
__Amy Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
__Sheldon Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?
__Amy You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.
__Sheldon You just can't keep it in your space pants, can you?
__Amy Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.
__Sheldon They would, wouldn't they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?
__Amy I guess we'll have to make a new video together, as a couple.
__Sheldon Good idea. And since you've had such a rough day, I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face.
__Emily That's okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.
__Raj Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.
__Emily Can I ask you one thing?
__Raj Of course. What?
__Emily Did you look in my closet?
__Raj No. Just the drawer.
__Emily You promise you didn't look in the closet?
__Raj I promise. Why, what's in there?
__Emily Don't worry about it. Good night.
__Amy I'd say I'm sorry I asked, except I didn't.
__Sheldon Oh, look, it's the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.
__Amy Oh, let me see.
__Sheldon I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
__Amy Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all.
__Sheldon Well, that can't be right.
__Amy It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?
__Sheldon All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards.
__Amy Poor Leonard.
__Sheldon Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
__Amy He might not be.
__Sheldon Oh, maybe you're right. He is kind of a lump.
__Amy Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard's team?
__Sheldon Oh, I'd be incensed.
__Amy So you see what I'm getting at?
__Sheldon Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Grass is always greener?
__Amy Try again.
__Sheldon Well, I don't know, we're all Groot? Just tell me.
__Amy Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He's going to feel bad.
__Sheldon But it wasn't my fault. I didn't exclude him. And I didn't write the article.
__Amy Remember that time you didn't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
__Sheldon Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.
__Amy Exactly.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Of course. I know what it's like having to go through a loved one's possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it's a thing.
__Bernadette Well, it'll be good that you're there. Howard's been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.
__Howard Well, it's hard. A lot of Ma's stuff brings back fond memories.
__Bernadette Is that why you couldn't get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
__Howard Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody's looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn't. And I'm okay with that.
__Leonard Actually, your name is on the electric bill.
__Sheldon Oh, right. This is a disaster.
__Leonard I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.
__Sheldon Okay, I have to tell you something, but you're not going to like it.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Sheldon An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
__Leonard Did they hate it?
__Sheldon No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn't say enough nice things about it.
__Leonard So what's the problem?
__Sheldon You know how the PennySaver only has my name…
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Sheldon They didn't mention you in the article. Only me.
__Leonard Really?
__Sheldon I know. It's not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let's keep those tight.
__Leonard Uh, that, that's not necessary.
__Sheldon It is. They're what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn't read it. It'll only make you feel worse.
__Leonard Cooper and his team?
__Sheldon You should know I had nothing to do with that.
__Leonard Uh, at least they're talking about the theory. I mean, that's what's important.
__Sheldon You know, you're right. Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he's far richer. And he's a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.
__Leonard That's not helping.
__Sheldon Well, I'd give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position's so forgettable.
__Raj It's nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom's house.
__Howard Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.
__Stuart Hey. Just so you know, the power's out.
__Bernadette What happened?
__Stuart I called, they said a transformer blew. It's the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.
__Howard Wait, when did it go out?
__Stuart In the middle of the night.
__Howard Oh, my God.
__Bernadette Howie, what's wrong?
__Howard It's all defrosting.
__Bernadette It's okay. It's just food.
__Howard It's not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it's the last one.
__Raj Everything okay?
__Howard No. All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.
__Bernadette Well, why don't we take it home and put it in our freezer?
__Raj You don't want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.
__Bernadette What should we do?
__Howard I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do. We're gonna eat it.
__Bernadette There's, like, twenty pounds of food in there.
__Howard All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn't say they couldn't pass through my colon first.
__Bernadette Howie.
__Howard Okay. Then how about this? Let's invite everyone over to dinner. It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.
__Bernadette I love that.
__Raj Me, too. Oh, look, we've got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.
__Leonard It's kind of a big deal.
__Penny If it's such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?
__Leonard Can we please just stop talking about it?
__Penny I'm sorry. What can I do?
__Leonard Nothing, I'm fine.
__Penny No, no. I'm gonna cheer you up. Here we go.
__Leonard What are we doing?
__Penny I am taking you shopping.
__Leonard Oh.
__Penny My baby is sad, and I'm gonna make him happy again.
__Leonard Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it's just not really my thing.
__Penny Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?
__Leonard Does it have a camera in it?
__Penny It does have a camera in it.
__Leonard Baby's listening.
__Sheldon Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
__Leonard What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
__Sheldon I did.
__Leonard Thank you. What did he say?
__Sheldon He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
__Leonard Why did he think you're the lead scientist? It was my idea.
__Penny You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.
__Sheldon Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is 'cause my name is on it.
__Penny You know what? I did it. What's four bucks?
__Leonard If you're trying to make me feel better, it's not working.
__Sheldon Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Oh. That's just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up.  Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I'm ready whenever you are.
__Amy Well, that is an important part.
__Sheldon Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.
__Amy But Leonard's idea was good.
__Sheldon Fine. Then Grumpy, what's he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.
__Penny Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?
__Leonard Yeah. But now he's happy to let people think he's responsible for everything.
__Penny And that's why you get an iPad helicopter.
__Amy It's not your fault.
__Sheldon Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
__Amy Not your fault.
__Sheldon Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn't correct him?
__Amy Hey, look at that pretty bird.
__Penny I know, I know.
__Leonard I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.
__Bernadette Thanks.
__Howard Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.
__Bernadette Did she throw anything away?
__Howard No. If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself.
__Raj Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.
__Howard No, that's noodle kugel.
__Raj One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.
__Howard Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.
__Bernadette You okay?
__Howard Yeah, I'm okay. Let's get started.
__Raj You got it.
__Howard I'm never gonna talk to her again.
__Bernadette Should we tell everyone not to come?
__Howard No. I want to do this.
__Bernadette Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can.
__Howard Okay.
__Raj I'm not making any promises.
__Leonard Of course.
__Penny Wow, it looks really pretty in here.
__Stuart Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.
__Leonard So, Stuart, have you thought about what you'd do if Howard sells the house?
__Stuart And there goes the mood.
__Sheldon Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.
__Leonard Subtle.
__Sheldon But you got it, right?
__Howard Hey, guys.
__All Hey. Hi. Hello.
__Howard I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight's not a sad occasion.
__Bernadette Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before.
__Howard Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.
__Amy Do you need any help in the kitchen?
__Penny All right, hey, you two, we're here for Howard right now, okay?
__Amy Yes, so please behave yourselves.
__Leonard Fine.
__Sheldon Of course.
__Stuart So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How's that going?
__Raj Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.
__Howard That's not true. We've got tomatoes right here.
__Amy All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.
__Sheldon Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.
__Penny Oh, so it's like The View.
__Amy Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.
__Sheldon Oh, I' Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek…
__Penny Shut up.
__Raj I would like to propose a salon topic.
__Amy Ooh, please do, Rajesh.
__Raj The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
__Penny Wait, who's Tor?
__Stuart It's true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.
__Amy We won't know if there's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
__Howard I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.
__Penny Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.
__Sheldon I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution.
__Leonard Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What's more important, an idea or its execution?
__Bernadette Oh, that's fine.
__Sheldon Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Penny Guys.
__Leonard No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?
__Sheldon Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it'll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.
__Leonard Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.
__Sheldon Leonard, please. His mother just died.
__Leonard You're being ridiculous.
__Sheldon Yeah, so are you.
__Penny Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I'd go to my real salon.
__Sheldon Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea, but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did.
__Leonard Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.
__Sheldon Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don't know about you, but I support our boys overseas.
__Amy And girls.
__Leonard So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
__Sheldon I didn't hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
__Leonard You want some of this? I'll give you some.
__Bernadette Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!
__Sheldon She said my name first, that must kill you.
__Bernadette I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We're eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there's no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. And don't think…
__Howard You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?
__Amy I don't hear it.
__Raj No, not at all.
__Howard It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.
__Sheldon You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…
__Penny Shut up.
__Ra So glad you two are done fighting.
__Leonard Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up.
__Sheldon Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.
__Stuart What'd they say?
__Amy Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?
__Sheldon They did.
__All Yay.
__Bernadette Good news, I found more Tums.
__All Yay.
__Leonard Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.
__Sheldon Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I'll have fries with that. Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences.
__Penny You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.
__Amy Are you all set for your trip?
__Sheldon Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.
__Penny PRK?
__Leonard Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.
__Sheldon I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.
__Leonard Keep going.
__Sheldon And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let's see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo.
__Penny You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?
__Amy Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard If it's half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I'm in.
__Sheldon I'll begin. Uh, I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
__Leonard That soy Frappuccino I had.
__Sheldon Will you please play the game? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
__Leonard I don't know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?
__Sheldon I don't want to play anymore.
__Leonard We haven't been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.
__Sheldon We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.
__Leonard No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That's pretty cool.
__Sheldon I suppose it is. In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music, I'd be okay with that.
__Leonard What? This road trip just got crazy.
__Sheldon Play that funky music, white boy.
__Leonard I'm surprised you know that reference.
__Sheldon What reference?
__Amy Can I be in charge of pricing? I've been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?
__Howard All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75.
__Raj Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?
__Penny Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.
__Raj Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.
__Penny Oh, I meant beer pong.
__Amy I had a table, too, but I didn't have any friends, so all I did was serve.
__Bernadette You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.
__Amy And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.
__Howard Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.
__Bernadette I think you just answered your own question.
__Howard Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.
__Bernadette Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don't need to decide this right now.
__Howard Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind.
__Bernadette Of course.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well?
__Leonard Sure.
__Sheldon Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
__Leonard It could be.
__Sheldon So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself?
__Leonard Exactly.
__Sheldon Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.
__Leonard Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.
__Sheldon Will our hotel room be ready?
__Leonard I doubt it.
__Sheldon Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?
__Leonard If we do, we'll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?
__Sheldon Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch.
__Leonard Oh, that's true. It's not like we can get in there.
__Sheldon Why not?
__Leonard I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
__Sheldon Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.
__Leonard We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.
__Sheldon Yes. Oh, I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it.
__Leonard I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it.
__Sheldon What are you talking about?
__Howard We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.
__Bernadette It's tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.
__Amy Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.
__Howard We're not selling it, it's mine.
__Bernadette You can't just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?
__Howard That's not fair. It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.
__Raj You could play Ping-Pong for it.
__Howard I would do that.
__Bernadette How is that fair? You grew up with a table.
__Howard Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.
__Penny Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.
__Bernadette Yes, Penny plays for me.
__Howard That's not fair, she has upper body muscles.
__Raj Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.
__Howard That's right, okay, Raj can play for me.
__Amy Ooh, you just chose champions. It's like we're re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.
__Penny Yeah, it's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.
__Bernadette Leonard makes you watch that, too?
__Penny No, no, I like that show. It's got dragons and people doing it.
__Howard So it's settled. The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.
__Amy If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it.
__Leonard Wasn't even that hard to find.
__Sheldon This is so amazing.
__Leonard I know. You want to get a picture?
__Sheldon I want more than a picture. I want to go in.
__Leonard Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.
__Sheldon Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?
__Leonard No, but I don't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.
__Sheldon There's a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let's see what happens.
__Leonard Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I'm a little nervous.
__Sheldon Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.
__Leonard Right.
__Sheldon You pushed it, are you out of your mind?
__Voice May I help you?
__Leonard Um, uh, uh, uh, we don't have an appointment, and, and we don't belong here, but we, we're, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in.
__Sheldon You're blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.
__Voice Hello? This speaker's not working, just pull up.
__Leonard And that's how it's done.
__Leonard We're trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.
__Sheldon I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what's the plan?
__Leonard Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.
__Sheldon Honesty will never get us in.
__Leonard Well, what's your plan?
__Sheldon All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.
__Security Guard Who are you here to see?
__Leonard Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth.
__Sheldon Oh, you are killing me.
__Leonard We don't have an appointment. We, we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work, and we thought we'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.
__Security Guard Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can't let you in.
__Sheldon What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.
__Leonard I'm sorry, don't listen to him. We're actually physicists. We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.
__Security Guard Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can't let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.
__Leonard Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best… What are you doing?
__Sheldon Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.
__Security Guard Don't move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23.
__Voice Copy.
__Sheldon I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely. I'd take a picture, but people are chasing me. I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn't dare use… Aaaaaaagh!
__Amy Rajesh eight, Penny four.
__Penny Sorry, he's really good.
__Bernadette Hey, Raj. if Howard can't keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?
__Raj What?
__Bernadette I don't know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool 'cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don't know much about<i> Doctor Who.
__Howard Don't listen to her. You and I go way back, we're like brothers.
__Raj We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.
__Amy Eight-five.
__Howard This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?
__Amy Uh, it, it's been a long time. I don't know. I'm probably pretty rusty.
__Penny Wow.
__Howard She's my champion.
__Bernadette Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj.
__Penny Hey.
__Bernadette Oh, come on, like you even care.
__Penny I care. Oh, wait, no, I don't. Good luck, Raj.
__Howard You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.
__Raj So did I.
__Leonard I don't know. Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.
__Sheldon Oh, I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…
__Leonard Oh, shut up.
__Nerdy Guy He's right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police.
__ Uh-huh, I'm normally very nice, but you shut up, too.
__Sheldon So, what are you in for?
__Nerdy Guy Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.
__Sheldon But why are you here?
__Nerdy Guy Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.
__Security Guard All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we're gonna let you go with a warning. But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges.
__Leonard We understand. Thank you so much.
__Nerdy Guy Uh, what about me?
__Security Guard No, you're not going anywhere, kissy face. Let's go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.
__Sheldon Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.
__Bernadette Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn't that right, Raj?
__Raj Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.
__Bernadette Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.
__Raj Okay, uh, I'm gonna own you, bitch.
__Penny Whoa.
__Bernadette Hey.
__Amy That's not nice.
__Raj Let's just play.
__Howard One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?
__Bernadette Don't listen to him, all she's got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.
__Penny It's in your purse. Play.
__Bernadette One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.
__Howard Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.
__Bernadette Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.
__Amy Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.
__Howard It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.
__Bernadette You know, Amy, I, uh, can't help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.
__Amy Keep talking.
__Leonard Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.
__Sheldon Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.
__Leonard The glass is empty, Sheldon. It's completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?
__Sheldon Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you're looking at this all wrong.
__Leonard Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.
__Sheldon Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.
__Leonard That part was pretty good.
__Sheldon See?
__Leonard You did flop around a lot.
__Sheldon I'll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.
__Leonard You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.
__Sheldon That's amazing.
__Sheldon And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?
__Leonard I guess this could count as an adventure.
__Amy Really should have thought this through.
__Howard No, I'm not.
__Raj Yes, you are.
__Howard No, I'm not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?
__Leonard Well, the G stands for graphics. That's a hard G, so I'd say gif.
__Raj The guy who invented it says it's jif.
__Howard I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?
__Sheldon Well, I'll give you three guesses why I'm so irritated.
__Howard Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
__Sheldon I guess news travels fast. It's true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn't included.
__Leonard Oh, Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because they don't think you're an elite scientist.
__Howard Yeah, I bet you anything it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.
__Sheldon You're just saying that to make me feel better.
__Leonard Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.
__Sheldon Agreed.
__Leonard I was gonna say or, but why bother?
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Hey, I got you a little gift.
__Bernadette Oh, that's a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.
__Raj You know me. I'm from India. I can't resist children begging. So, how's it going with the title to the house?
__Howard Great, it's all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn't have to meet him, I didn't have to talk to him, I don't even know where he is.
__Raj Wow, so you're not curious at all?
__Howard Nope.
__Raj Hmm. What if he's in prison? What if he's a spy? What if he's in a Beatles cover band? I'm just saying, if he's got your nose and haircut, he'd make a killer Ringo.
__Penny Oh, it's cool, I've never been on a podcast before.
__Leonard Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil's had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.
__Penny Those are Star Trek people.
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny I only figured that out because I've never heard of any of them.
__Wil I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.
__Penny Sorry.
__Wil Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we're gonna take some calls, we'll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.
__Leonard This is exciting.
__Wil Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.
__Penny What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
__Wil Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.
__Sheldon Sure. It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house and have anything better to do.
__Amy Is this how the rest of the night's going to be?
__Sheldon I don't know the future. Do you think there's a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it?
__Amy No, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Then buckle up, you're in for a cranky night.
__Amy According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we're not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.
__Sheldon You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
__Amy Well, it applies to you, too.
__Sheldon I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling. Although, I must admit, I'm smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.
__Bernadette You know, I'm thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.
__Raj You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it's a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.
__Howard Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one's knocking anything down.
__Bernadette Okay, okay. When he's at Comic-Con, I'm bringing in a wrecking ball.
__Howard Can I help you?
__Guy at door Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?
__Howard Yes.
__Guy Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.
__Howard Wuh, uh, who's your father?
__Guy Sam Wolowitz.
__Howard Sam Wolowitz is my father.
__Guy I know.
__Howard Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you're my half-brother?
__Guy I think so.
__Howard Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.
__Wil Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.
__Leonard Psst.
__Wil I've just been handed a note. I'm going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.
__Leonard I, I didn't want to interrupt.
__Wil Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny's fiancé. Uh, Leonard, why don't you grab some headphones and join us?
__Leonard Really?
__Wil Yeah.
__Leonard Hey, great.
__Wil So, while Leonard gets set up, let's take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.
__Caller I don't have a question. I just want to say I'm a big fan of the movie. I've seen it, like, ten times.
__Penny Okay, well, I'll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.
__Wil Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.
__Penny Really?
__Wil Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.
__Leonard Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.
__Wil All right, it's time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he's the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.
__Kevn Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‘Cause it's been, like, two minutes and you haven't even brought up Stand By Me.
__Penny Hey, Kevin. It's really exciting to talk to you.
__Leonard It really is.
__Kevin Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.
__Penny Oh, wow. I wish it was better.
__Wil Oh, don't worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin's films?
__Kevin You're cruisin' for a beatin', Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.
__Penny Aw.
__Wil You know, I'm in the movie, too.
__Kevin Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you're not in more stuff, man? I'd cast you in a minute.
__Penny Seriously?
__Kevin Oh, yeah, man. I'm actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I've ever done before. It's called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.
__Penny Oh, my, I would love that.
__Leonard You have a new job.
__Penny Well, maybe I can do both.
__Leonard I don't think you can do both.
__Penny I don't think I asked you.
__Kevin Yeah, you tell him, Penny.
__Leonard Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.
__Amy Probably not. It's an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
__Sheldon You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I've since evolved, and now I think it's dumb.
__Amy Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
__Sheldon Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you're all by yourself.
__Amy When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.
__Sheldon I can just picture them all right now at Feynman's house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They're missing out on hilarious jokes like that.
__Amy And at the same time, not.
__Sheldon It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn't let me in. I hated that so much.
__Amy You know, there's nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.
__Sheldon Isn't that a little juvenile?
__Amy More juvenile than this?
__Sheldon I'll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.
__Bernadette Oh, let me do it, Howard.
__Howard No, I got it.
__Bernadette So, Josh, what do you do?
__Bernadette Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.
__Raj Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
__Josh Why would I lie?
__Raj Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?
__Josh No.
__Raj A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?
__Josh No.
__Raj You're in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
__Bernadette Why don't you help with the coffee?
__Raj Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I'd like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?
__Howard Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?
__Raj I get it. What do you want to do?
__Howard I don't know. I, I'd just like him to go away. I can't deal with this.
__Raj All right, I've got your back.
__Howard Thank you. Come on. And I'd like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.
__Josh I can't believe my brother's an astronaut. That's amazing. What was it like?
__Raj Listen, dude, it's time for you to hit the road.
__Howard Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.
__Leonard No, no, no. We're not fighting, we're just having a conversation.
__Wil All right. We're listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancé, who doesn't believe women should have dreams.
__Leonard Give me back that juice.
__Penny What is the harm if I audition?
__Leonard Well, what if you get it?
__Penny I don't know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.
__Leonard From a Kevin Smith movie?
__Kevin Oh, I'm hanging up now.
__Wil Don't you listen to him, buddy. You're awesome. You're one of the greatest directors of our time.
__Kevin I don't have a part for you, Wheaton.
__Wil And that was Kevin Smith.
__Leonard I'm just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
__Penny Okay, instead of protecting me, why don't you try being excited when something good happens?
__Leonard I'm always excited for you. I'm excited that you found this new job where you're making decent money.
__Penny Decent? I make twice what you make.
__Leonard Wait, twice?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Like, times two twice?
__Wil For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does. Let's listen.
__Leonard I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I'm still paying off college loans.
__Penny Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.
__Leonard Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?
__Wil For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.
__Sheldon Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
__Amy Can I come in?
__Sheldon Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.
__Amy Amazing.
__Sheldon I know. This isn't the printout. This is my real face.
__Amy What are we doing? This is a fort. Let's sit on the floor.
__Sheldon Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.
__Josh Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.
__Bernadette Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?
__Josh Sorry, I have a long drive.
__Howard Well, I hope I get to see you again.
__Josh I hope so, too. I've always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.
__Bernadette Keep dreaming.
__Howard Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.
__Josh Wow.
__Bernadette He did it with a robot.
__Josh You had sex with a robot?
__Howard That's not what she meant.
__Raj But technically, yes.
__Penny In a safe place.
__Leonard What does that mean, under your bed?
__Penny No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I'm not overly conservative. I'm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.
__Leonard Wait a minute, you have a guy?
__Penny Don't you have a guy?
__Leonard Why would I have a guy? I don't have any money.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.
__Wil For those of you listening at home, how great is this?
__Leonard Wil, I'm begging you, just please turn that off.
__Wil Sure. And we're back.
__Penny Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I'm sure in time they'll change again.
__Leonard Great, you're not only more successful than me, now you're more mature.
__Penny Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?
__Leonard That would be great, thank you.
__Wil I'm just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you're all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?
__Leonard Yes, it is, Wil.
__Josh ‘Cause that's all you need, right?
__Howard You are my brother.
__Amy I'd say, Knox over Ticonderoga, 'cause it's got the gold.
__Sheldon Mm-hmm.
__Amy And McBlanket over Sumter 'cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o'clock. Date night's over.
__Sheldon Wait, no. We haven't picked a winner.
__Amy We both know this one's gonna win.
__Sheldon Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn't have a secret physics lending library.
__Amy Come on, I'll help you take this down.
__Sheldon Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?
__Amy Well, as long as we're suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.
__Sheldon That's a big step.
__Amy It's a big fort.
__Sheldon Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.
__Amy PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
__Sheldon G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.
__Amy You got yourself a sleepover.
__Sheldon Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
__Amy Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
__Sheldon It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we'd be in the living room?
__Amy Who says this is the only one I hid?
__Sheldon We built a fort.
__Leonard Are those my sheets?
__Amy Yes, they are.
__Leonard Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I'm gonna go to sleep.
__Sheldon Well, Leonard, don't you want to see the inside of the fort?
__Sheldon Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in.
__Leonard Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?
__Sheldon I want to say no, but it's too glorious. Get in here.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Amy Okay, have a seat on the floor.
__Sheldon Not there. That's my spot.
__Howard Sure.
__Leonard Really?
__Sheldon There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S…
__Leonard Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.
__Sheldon Perhaps you'd prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.
__Leonard That's pretty cool, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I'd love her to get behind it.
__Raj Hey.
__Leonard Hey.
__Howard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA's been working on?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Raj Well, they're looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.
__Leonard Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.
__Sheldon All right, you can't breathe our air without an inhaler, he's allergic to Earth nuts, but I'm the alien.
__Raj Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.
__Sheldon Excellent.
__Howard Good for you.
__Leonard Congratulations.
__Raj And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
__Leonard Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?
__Sheldon I'll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.
__Howard Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.
__Sheldon Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
__Howard Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?
__Raj Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you're on the team.
__Leonard My mommy raised a gentleman.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Yeah. I'm excited to help.
__Raj I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would've happened. They would've taken over the project and bossed us around.
__Leonard I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.
__Raj You should have told him to mind his own business.
__Leonard Yeah. That's better than what I did say, which was, fine, I'll eat them with club soda.
__Raj What makes them think they're always in charge of everything?
__Leonard Mmm, they're alpha males.
__Raj Huh, what does that make us?
__Leonard We could be betas. They're second in charge.
__Leonard Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
__Raj Okay, that sounds like us.
__Leonard Whatever. There's no alphas here, and this is your project. You're in charge. How do you want to start?
__Raj I don't know. How do you want to start?
__Leonard I don't know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?
__Raj No. We can do this by ourselves.
__Leonard Okay. Great. How do you want to start?
__Raj I don't know. How do you want to start?
__Sheldon I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.
__Penny Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.
__Sheldon I don't recommend it. You'll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you're looking for Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.
__Penny Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.
__Sheldon How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.
__Penny No, no. It's about my acting career.
__Sheldon Oh, sorry. That's not on the list.
__Penny Well.
__Sheldon Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.
__Penny Okay, look, here's the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it's going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.
__Sheldon Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.
__Penny Well, why?
__Sheldon I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.
__Penny You're really not gonna tell me?
__Sheldon No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I'll start.
__Howard I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
__Bernadette Oh. How do you drink it?
__Howard Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.
__Bernadette I think I'll have a beer.
__Howard First take a picture with me.
__Bernadette Why?
__Howard Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I'm putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.
__Bernadette Is this about the space probe he's working on without you?
__Howard You betcha. The very one.
__Bernadette Howard, you're grown men. You guys don't have to do everything together.
__Howard I know. That's why I'm spending tonight with you.
__Bernadette Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.
__Howard With my honeybunch.
__Bernadette You're being childish.
__Howard No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.
__Bernadette I'm sorry. What do we know?
__Howard In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.
__Bernadette Don't take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?
__Howard You don't think I'm a leader?
__Bernadette I was kidding. Of course you are.
__Howard Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to.
__Bernadette You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you're done or can you do it all by yourself?
__Howard All by myself.
__Bernadette There's my big boss man.
__Penny Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.
__Sheldon Mmm.
__Penny If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?
__Sheldon Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
__Penny No.
__Sheldon All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.
__Penny Oh. You're right. I'm worried about something that hasn't even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
__Sheldon Well, Penny, who's smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?
__Penny Oh, I guess you're right. Maybe it is the person who asks.
__Sheldon No, it's the wise man. That's why he's called the wise man. You know how I know that? I'm the wise man.
__Penny I'm sorry. What was I thinking?
__Sheldon Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this?
__Penny ‘Cause I already know what he'll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it.
__Sheldon Ah, it's just like he's here.
__Leonard Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.
__Raj Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.
__Leonard That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.
__Raj Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.
__Leonard My God, when he's on the table and they use the paddles on him.
__Raj And he's all white.
__Leonard They zip him up in that bag.
__Raj And Gertie can't stop crying.
__Leonard The flower dies.
__Raj Okay, let's talk about something else.
__Leonard All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that's simple.
__Raj And doesn't require outside machinery to be built to access it.
__Leonard It's also a problem because we don't even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.
__Raj Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.
__Leonard That's actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.
__Raj Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.
__Leonard Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
__Raj Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.
__Leonard The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
__Raj Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.
__Leonard All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
__Raj We, we can totally do that.
__Leonard I know.
__Raj This is great.
__Leonard Yeah, you know what else it is?
__Raj What?
__Howard Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.
__Raj Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.
__Howard Hang on. Not that your song isn't terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?
__Sheldon You didn't let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.
__Leonard Hey.
__Howard Hello.
__Raj Look, I know you guys are upset, but we've talked about it, and we think it'd be beneficial for you to be part of the project.
__Howard Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
__Leonard We want you back on the project with us.
__Sheldon Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?
__Raj Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I'd love your help.
__Howard I suppose it couldn't have been easy for you to say that.
__Raj It wasn't, so are you in?
__Sheldon Certainly.
__Howard Sure.
__Leonard Great. Now that we're all on the same page, let's get together tonight and work on it.
__Sheldon Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.
__Raj Okay, I think we should do it right now.
__Sheldon Tonight works better for me.
__Sheldon Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.
__Leonard How is that building on what he just said?
__Howard Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.
__Raj Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.
__Sheldon Building on building on that, there's a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.
__Leonard Building on that, I'd like to remind you, I'm lactose intolerant.
__Howard I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.
__Sheldon Bah, you didn't say building on. You're out.
__Leonard It's not Simon Says.
__Raj Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You're out, and you're out. I win. Who wants pizza?
__Penny Oh, hey.
__Girl Hey. I haven't seen you auditioning in a while.
__Penny Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.
__Girl You quit acting?
__Penny Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.
__Second Girl I heard you can make good money doing that.
__Penny Yeah, it's going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.
__First Girl Really?
__Penny Mmm.
__First Girl ‘Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.
__Audiitoner Chelsea?
__First Girl Wish me luck.
__Second Girl They're gonna love you. I heard she's pushing 40 and everything's fake.
__Penny Yeah. I started that rumour.
__Raj Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.
__Howard The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
__Sheldon Yeah, I never cared for that. It's advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.
__Leonard Squeeze yourself.
__Sheldon Oh, don't be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.
__Howard You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That's ridiculous.
__Raj Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?
__Sheldon Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.
__Howard It's not always.
__Leonard What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba's head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.
__Sheldon We looked great.
__Leonard You let a guy sit on me.
__Howard He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.
__Leonard I'm just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.
__Raj Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn't even think to ask me and Leonard.
__Howard You know what? You're right. I should have asked you.
__Sheldon Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It's amazing.
__Howard Okay, and if we're talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.
__Sheldon Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.
__Leonard Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
__Sheldon I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I'm having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I'm in charge. Now, why don't you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?
__Leonard Sheldon, you're not in charge. Raj is in charge.
__Sheldon Leonard, who's really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?
__Raj He's right. If you think about it, we're all in charge.
__Sheldon No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?
__Amy I can't believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.
__Penny I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.
__Bernadette Well, I'm glad you have a new appreciation for your job.
__Penny I do, and you know, I don't think I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.
__Bernadette Properly, at all. It's just words I've never heard.
__Penny Well, thank you. You're a good friend, and you changed my life.
__Bernadette You're welcome. Hey, now that you're making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.
__Penny Sure.
__Amy And you probably have to invite your other friend 'cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.
__Penny Okay.
__Bernadette How about now?
__Penny All right.
__Bernadette Don't forget your wallet.
__First Alien That soft pink alien looks delicious.
__Second Alien I could eat.
__Howard I'll figure it out.
__Raj It streams HD video straight to your phone while it's flying.
__Howard Nice. Where were you when I was single?
__Leonard Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?
__Penny Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.
__Sheldon If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you're packed.
__Amy Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?
__Leonard Nope. It's pretty exciting.
__Sheldon Aren't you afraid of being blinded?
__Leonard How would I be blinded?
__Sheldon At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.
__Leonard I'll take my chances.
__Sheldon Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.
__Raj Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they're boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?
__Howard Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?
__Raj I don't know. Why do I own one?
__Amy I think it's really nice that you're sharing this experience with Penny.
__Leonard Mm, I thought it'd be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.
__Bernadette Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.
__Amy With a beautiful girl on your arm.
__Sheldon And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.
__Leonard Why did you need a belt?
__Penny It's called an evening look. I've never been to New Jersey before.
__Leonard It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.
__Penny So it's not really like that?
__Leonard No, it's like that. Well, I'm excited to show you around.
__Penny You think we'll have time to visit your mom over there?
__Leonard Yes. We'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I'm not doing that either.  Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight's been cancelled.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Yeah, looks like there's a big storm all up the East Coast.
__Penny Well, can we get on another airline?
__Leonard I don't think so.
__Penny So, that's it? We're not going?
__Leonard I guess not.
__Penny Well, that sucks.
__Leonard Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.
__Leonard Oh, thank you, but I'm okay.
__Penny Are you sure? I could pretend I'm a high school cheerleader who can't control herself around esteemed alumni.
__Leonard Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.
__Penny Ooh.
__Sheldon All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
__Howard Maybe we should recalibrate it.
__Sheldon All right.
__Howard Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.
__Sheldon It actually says at least?
__Howard Yeah.
__Sheldon Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
__Howard Sheldon.
__Sheldon You see where I'm going with this.
__Howard Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
__Sheldon All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they're still getting at least one angry letter.
__Howard Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
__Howard It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.
__Sheldon Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.
__Dr Koothrapalli Not much, just wanted to see how my son's doing.
__Raj Very well, thank you.
__Dr Koothrapalli Are you still dating that dermatologist?
__Raj If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn't have to ask.
__Dr Koothrapalli Oh, and there's something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month's rent on a toy helicopter?!
__Raj Oh, you're where that bill goes.
__Dr Koothrapalli I'm tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It's time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.
__Raj No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.
__Dr Koothrapalli No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you're on your own.
__Raj But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can't hug you every day, flying that helicopter…
__Dr Koothrapalli I'm cutting you off.
__Raj Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?
__Sheldon Yay.
__Howard It's green.
__Sheldon We did it. Oh, if it's this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.
__Howard Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.
__Sheldon Oh, no.
__Howard Oh. All right, playtime's over. Let's open this baby up.
__Sheldon Won't that void the warranty?
__Howard Sheldon, I have a master's degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.
__Penny I got you a little something to cheer you up.
__Leonard Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?
__Penny Just open it.
__Leonard A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?
__Penny Because you are giving your commencement speech.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Penny I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.
__Leonard Really? That's amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.
__Penny Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.
__Leonard Short and sexy, that's my wheelhouse.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon You know what they all do, right?
__Howard Yes, of course.
__Sheldon What about this one?
__Howard Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?
__Howard That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.
__Sheldon So, can you get it working?
__Howard I'm an MIT-trained engineer. I've built components for the space station.
__Sheldon I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work.
__Howard It worked fine, it just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.
__Raj Hey, guys.
__Howard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?
__Sheldon Well, don't worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.
__Raj I don't freaking believe this.
__Howard Relax, it'll be fine.
__Raj No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.
__Raj What?
__Sheldon I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.
__Raj Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.
__Howard Calm down.
__Raj Okay. Okay, you're right. It's time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man.  Hello, Mummy.
__Mrs Koothrapalli Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.
__Raj Well, I've been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?
__Mrs Koothrapalli Such a sweet boy for asking. Can't believe you come from the poison seed of your father.
__Raj Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn't afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.
__Mrs Koothrapalli What does that mean, active social life?
__Raj Well, let's not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let's talk about you.
__Mrs Koothrapalli Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?
__Raj All I know, Mummy, is that he's a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there's no money for your little boy.
__Mrs Koothrapalli Well, however much money your father was giving you, I'll give you more.
__Raj Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.
__Leonard I don't think this is gonna work.
__Penny Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.
__Leonard A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.
__Penny Oh. Well, you do.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Yeah. You're gonna be on Skype, they're not gonna see your legs.
__Leonard Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.
__Penny Add a belt and I'll take you some place nice.
__Leonard Oh. Done and done.
__Sheldon Very impressive. You know, when you're done with that, can you look at this? It doesn't make smoke anymore.
__Howard One toy at a time.
__Sheldon Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it's for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.
__Raj What's the first one?
__Howard Suicide.
__Sheldon Wrong. Obesity.
__Bernadette I have the tool you wanted.
__Howard Thank you.
__Raj You guys don't have to go to the trouble. I'm back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.
__Howard It's not about the money. It's about solving a problem. It's why I became an engineer. It's what I like to do, it's what I'm trained to do. It's who I am.
__Sheldon Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.
__Bernadette Why don't you just call tech support?
__Howard Hey.
__Sheldon Whoa.
__Raj Not cool.
__Bernadette What?
__Howard There's two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.
__Bernadette I call tech support all the time.
__Howard Ha-ha.
__Sheldon You call tech support.
__Raj What a baby.
__Leonard Members of the faculty, students, I'm excited to speak to you today. I can't help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I'd also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.
__Leonard They're graduating.
__Penny Okay, bye.
__Sheldon Check.
__Howard GPS?
__Raj Check.
__Howard Battery charged?
__Sheldon Check.
__Bernadette Four hours of our lives gone? Check.
__Howard All right. All systems go. In five…
__Together Four, three, two, one.
__Sheldon That's what my train used to do.
__Bernadette Ready to call tech support?
__Howard Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who's reading from the same manual I have. (Raj's phone rings)
__Raj It's my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.
__Dr Koothrapalli What did you say to your mother?
__Raj Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she's doing okay.
__Dr Koothrapalli Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I'm some sort of playboy.
__Raj Really? I don't know where she'd get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I'm so lucky I take after you.
__Dr Koothrapalli You think you take after me?
__Raj Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn't be a scientist if you hadn't been my role model. (Re-entering apartment) Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?
__Penny I'll, I'll tell you later.
__Leonard My point is, while you're spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you're really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it's over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.
__Howard What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.
__Sheldon It is awful, isn't it? Listen to that noise.
__Howard Hang on, hang on. It's working. I did it.
__Raj How'd you do that?
__Howard No idea, but I did it.
__Bernadette Maybe you shouldn't be flying it inside.
__Howard Well, I'm not flying it.
__Sheldon Then who is?
__Howard I don't know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.
__Sheldon Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera's working. Oh, look, it's me.
__Sheldon Yes, it's a robot uprising. Call the police.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I…
__Sheldon Don't worry, everyone in here is safe.
__Leonard I don't know, some time tomorrow morning.
__Penny Don't you want to know for sure?
__Amy It's so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
__Sheldon Well, my mother's been there for every honour I've won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?
__Penny Aw, it's so nice. She's gonna love it.
__Amy Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they're a bouquet of severed plant genitals.
__Sheldon You act like I didn't get you that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.
__Amy He's right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.
__Leonard If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.
__Penny Really? It didn't work for you.
__Amy Do you think the moms will get along?
__Leonard Uh, I don't know. They're pretty different.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Oh, thank you, Mother.
__Mrs Cooper I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.
__Sheldon Oh, it's quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
__Mrs Cooper Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.
__Sheldon What did they feed the lions, Mother?
__Mrs Cooper The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.
__Sheldon Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she's here?
__Mrs Cooper Are you ashamed of me?
__Sheldon Of course not. I love you. I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.
__Leonard No, we're kind of taking it slow.
__Dr Hofstadter I see.
__Leonard What does that mean?
__Dr Hofstadter You've been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there's a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?
__Leonard Yes, Mother.
__Dr Hofstadter Only satisfactory. I see.
__Leonard I change my answer. It, it's amazing. It's hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.
__Dr Hofstadter Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.
__Leonard See, this right here, what you're doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom?
__Dr Hofstadter Why? Are you attracted to her, too?
__Leonard Of course not. She's, she's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.
__Dr Hofstadter Leonard, I'm an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Dr Hofstadter Where is she from again?
__Leonard East Texas.
__Dr Hofstadter Ugh.
__Leonard Hey, look who's here.
__Sheldon Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.
__Dr Hofstadter Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.
__Sheldon Oh, thank you.
__Leonard We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
__Dr Hofstadter Of course I did, but it's a mother's job to make sure her child's self-esteem is not dependent on anyone's approval.
__Leonard That's so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.
__Sheldon Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.
__Dr Hofstadter So nice to meet you.
__Dr Hofstadter Very pleasant. And yours?
__Mrs Cooper Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.
__Dr Hofstadter You're kidding, right?
__Leonard Subtle, mom, real subtle.
__Stuart Morning.
__Bernadette We talked about this. I don't mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.
__Howard Hey.
__Dr Hofstadter Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.
__Mrs Cooper He did?
__Dr Hofstadter Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he's terrific.
__Sheldon Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?
__Leonard You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.
__Dr Hofstadter Calm down, dear. Mary, I'm curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?
__Sheldon Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.
__Mrs Cooper Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.
__Sheldon Ooh, this is a good one.
__Mrs Cooper Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn't think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.
__Sheldon But I wasn't. ‘Cause I didn't have any friends.
__Mrs Cooper No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.
__Dr Hofstadter Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, he was a handful.
__Sheldon I was a handful.
__Leonard You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.
__Dr Hofstadter All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.
__Raj We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.
__Stuart Clearly, you've never seen me try to talk to a woman.
__Bernadette Guys. In the time you've been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.
__Stuart I put on pants.
__Howard Kiss-ass.
__Bernadette Okay, I don't know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.
__Raj Hey, I don't even live here.
__Bernadette Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?
__Raj I do. And some of it's wool, so dry flat if possible.
__Dr Hofstadter You don't look very happy.
__Sheldon Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.
__Mrs Cooper Shelly does not like change.
__Sheldon Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.
__Penny Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.
__Dr Hofstadter Hello. Oh, okay.
__Penny Sorry, I forgot.
__Sheldon You remember my mother.
__Penny Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.
__Mrs Cooper Good to see you again, dear.
__Penny Ah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.
__Leonard So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged.
__Penny Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.
__Dr Hofstadter Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.
__Sheldon Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.
__Leonard We did not. That's not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
__Sheldon Oh, sure.
__Leonard It came from Tiffany's.
__Sheldon You mean the box, right?
__Leonard Keep walking.
__Penny Really doesn't matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
__Sheldon Did I misspeak about the ring?
__Leonard Yes, and we'll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.
__Sheldon Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
__Leonard Yes, you are a super weaner.
__Sheldon Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you're looking for is a double mother suckler.
__Leonard Yeah, you're right. That is the term I'm looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.
__Sheldon Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.
__Penny We're not in a rush. We'll set a date when the time is right.
__Dr Hofstadter Uch.
__Mrs Cooper Uch? The bible is uch to you?
__Dr Hofstadter No, I'm sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people's superstitions can be to them.
__Mrs Cooper You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?
__Dr Hofstadter His name is Sigmund Freud.
__Penny Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.
__Mrs Cooper Stay out of this.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Mrs Cooper At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.
__Dr Hofstadter It's fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?
__Mrs Cooper I know the answer. You're not gonna like it.
__Dr Hofstadter Try me.
__Mrs Cooper When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?
__Dr Hofstadter It means, I can't believe we're having this conversation.
__Mrs Cooper Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.
__Penny Why don't we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.
__Sheldon It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
__Leonard Oh, don't flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.
__Stuart Well, it's carrots, so gonna say very.
__Howard Sorry we have to do this.
__Stuart Bernadette's not wrong. She does work hard around here.
__Raj Yeah, maybe it's a good thing if she stops babying you so much.
__Howard She doesn't baby me.
__Stuart I saw her pull you home in a wagon.
__Howard For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.
__Raj Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.
__Howard You're right. It's time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.
__Sheldon Oh, it's all right. She'll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.
__Dr Hofstadter I can't help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.
__Sheldon Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.
__Dr Hofstadter But look how well you turned out.
__Sheldon I'd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard's brother and sister are.
__Dr Hofstadter I suppose.
__Sheldon While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
__Dr Hofstadter Do you suppose you would've flourished more in a reward-based environment?
__Sheldon Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?
__Mrs Cooper Oh, Leonard, I'm sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.
__Penny Yeah, and you certainly don't have to earn my love.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.
__Leonard That's not what it is.
__Penny I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.
__Mrs Cooper When your mom gets back, I'm gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.
__Mrs Cooper Doesn't matter, a good Christian would've turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would've shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who's in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?
__Leonard Oh, me.
__Penny Yeah, me, too.
__Mrs Cooper Coming up.
__Leonard I don't really feel I deserve it.
__Raj Looks good.
__Bernadette Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.
__Howard Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don't know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.
__Mrs Cooper And I will pray for you.
__Leonard Okay, Mom, let's get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.
__Dr Hofstadter One moment. There's something I need to say to you.
__Leonard Oh, really? That's too bad.
__Dr Hofstadter Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there's more than one way to raise a child.
__Sheldon I taught her that.
__Dr Hofstadter Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.
__Leonard Wow. When does that start?
__Dr Hofstadter So needy. Come to Mommy.
__Penny It's okay, go ahead.
__Dr Hofstadter Oh, my son.
__Leonard Oh, my mother.
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Together It's the hard-knock life for us, it's the hard-knock life for us. ‘Stead of treated, we get tricked, ‘stead of kisses, we get kicked, it's the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it's the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets ‘stead of wool, empty bellies ‘stead of full, it's a hard-knock life.
__Sheldon I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
__Amy That's what you're thinking about?
__Sheldon Well, one of the things.
__Amy Are any of them me?
__Sheldon Yes. I thought, I can't decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I'll ask Amy. Anyway.
__Amy What are you doing?
__Sheldon You're right, you did kind of kill the mood.
__Amy I didn't kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn't a decision to take lightly. I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
__Amy Really? That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?
__Sheldon Irony's not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.
__Amy Oh, sure, I'd love to.
__Sheldon Whenever you're ready.
__Raj Ooh. Hot date?
__Stuart Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don't have to not ask me twice.
__Emily If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn't it make a great lamp for my bedroom?
__Raj You're kidding, right?
__Emily Oh. Is this freaking you out?
__Raj I guess I'm just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.
__Emily All right. Never mind.
__Raj No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I'll buy it for you.
__Stuart Sold.
__Emily Raj, you don't have to do that.
__Stuart Too late. No returns.
__Penny Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Oh, good. You're here. I need your assistance.
__Leonard Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
__Sheldon What happened?
__Penny Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.
__Sheldon Been there.
__Penny Mmm. So what do you need help with?
__Sheldon Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.
__Penny Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Sheldon Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.
__Penny And that made her angry?
__Sheldon Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.
__Penny Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.
__Sheldon It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.
__Penny Yeah. I'm tapping out. Leonard?
__Leonard I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
__Sheldon Oh, no, not just a season. If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.
__Leonard I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
__Penny Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.
__Sheldon Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.
__Sheldon If that happens, don't make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.
__Bernadette You mean 'cause she has weird tattoos?
__Raj No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.
__Howard One more time?
__Raj She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let's go to a cemetery and do it on somebody's grave.
__Howard Like, a random person or somebody she knew?
__Raj What difference does it make?
__Howard Well, if it's her father's grave and they didn't get along, then you know she holds a grudge.
__Bernadette The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it's two consenting adults, I guess I don't see the harm in it.
__Raj Well, what if it's one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he's afraid of being alone?
__Bernadette Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.
__Raj I don't know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn't for me. Maybe I should break up with her.
__Howard Right. You're gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?
__Bernadette I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.
__Howard How are you saying that with a straight face?
__Bernadette I don't know.
__Raj You guys are being jerks.
__Howard Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you've never broken up with a girl in your life.
__Raj You're one to talk. You've been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don't see you showing him the door.
__Howard That's not the same thing. Emily's a person. Stuart's more like an infestation, something you spray for.
__Raj Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone's feelings as I am.
__Bernadette That's not true. We were just laughing right in your face.
__Leonard Mmm. My pleasure.
__Penny That carrot was delicious.
__Leonard Yeah. I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of 'em.
__Sheldon No, and I'm confused. It's been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she's wrong by now.
__Penny Hey, I don't think she's wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.
__Sheldon Too slow?
__Penny Yeah, you've been going out for years. You haven't even slept together.
__Sheldon That's right. It's called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren't moving forward in your relationship.
__Penny Uh, hello.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Sheldon But you've been engaged for over a year now, and you don't even have a wedding date.
__Penny Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Leonard We're gonna set a date.
__Sheldon Okay. If you say so.
__Penny Yeah, it's just, things are good right now.
__Leonard Really good.
__Penny I'm focusing on my job.
__Leonard And we've been busy with our paper.
__Penny So busy.
__Leonard Yeah, we'll pick a date when we pick a date.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Penny You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.
__Sheldon Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.
__Howard You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don't do even though they do?
__Bernadette You know which yoghurt I mean.
__Howard I didn't touch it. Must have been Stuart.
__Bernadette Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it's time we tell him he needs to move out.
__Howard We should have done it months ago.
__Bernadette I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.
__Howard Yeah, right. Sick. He didn't have jaundice. He just looks like that.
__Bernadette All right. Tonight's the night.
__Howard Agreed. When he gets home, I'm dropping the hammer.
__Bernadette Ooh, I like when you take charge.
__Howard Oh, I'm not taking charge, you're the hammer.
__Penny You know why.
__Leonard Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?
__Penny Not in a rush, busy with work…
__Sheldon Things are good right now.
__Penny Really good.
__Leonard You still want to get married, right?
__Penny Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?
__Leonard I don't know. Because we don't have a date?
__Penny Well, you want a date, pick a date.
__Leonard It's not just the date. We haven't talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?
__Sheldon Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.
__Penny Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?
__Leonard Is your dad paying for it?
__Penny I doubt it.
__Leonard Okay, two friends each.
__Penny All right, well, I want it in a church.
__Leonard Fine. I want black-tie.
__Penny Fine. I want to release butterflies.
__Sheldon Seriously? Airborne worms?
__Leonard Okay. Well, then it's settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.
__Penny Sounds perfect.
__Leonard Great.
__Sheldon You still didn't pick a date.
__Penny Stay out of it.
__Leonard Shut up.
__Raj Oh, yes, we've got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.
__Emily Makes you feel alive, doesn't it?
__Raj So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.
__Emily You aren't scared, are you?
__Raj Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.
__Penny No, it's okay.
__Leonard Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff.
__Sheldon Well, look at that, even when I'm causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don't we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny's love of the ol' glug-glug?
__Penny Uh, Sheldon, I think we're good for now.
__Sheldon Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date?
__Sheldon So you're never getting married? It's his whining, isn't it?
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.
__Sheldon It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.
__Leonard Look, all she's saying is we are in love so it doesn't matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.
__Penny Ew, 50? We'll be old and gross.
__Leonard Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.
__Sheldon My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.
__Penny Um, I'm free tonight.
__Leonard Are you saying you want to get married?
__Penny Vegas isn't that far away.
__Leonard I'm in. Let's do it.
__Penny Oh, thank you.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Sheldon Now get out of my spot.
__Bernadette Right.
__Howard Good luck.
__Bernadette Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.
__Howard Never should have told you my middle name.
__Stuart Hey, guys.
__Howard Hey, you got a minute?
__Stuart Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.
__Bernadette Don't let that sway you.
__Howard It's hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.
__Stuart What's up?
__Bernadette So, we need to talk.
__Bernadette Well, you've been living here a while now.
__Stuart I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Howard His middle name is David. Go.
__Emily Are you breaking up with me?
__Raj No, no, I'm just pointing out that you're dark on the inside and I'm dark on the outside.
__Howard You need to take that?
__Stuart It's just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I'll call him back. You were saying?
__Raj End things? I'm trying to tell you that I love you.
__Leonard Doesn't sound very romantic.
__Penny Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.
__Leonard I'm sure we'll find a decent chapel.
__Penny Yeah. This is crazy.
__Leonard I know. You think people are gonna be mad?
__Penny Maybe. But this isn't about them, it's about us.
__Leonard It is. It is about us.
__Penny And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.
__Leonard Right. No surprises.
__Penny And no regrets.
__Leonard Uh, well, there, there's one thing I feel I should tell you.
__Penny What?
__Leonard You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.
__Penny No, you told me.
__Leonard Okay, um, well, there was this girl.
__Penny What did you do?
__Leonard Nothing really. It was just kissing.
__Penny And then what?
__Leonard And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.
__Penny All right.
__Leonard Did you ever do anything like this since we've been?
__Penny Nope, never.
__Leonard Oh, that's too bad.
__Penny You know, can I ask you a question?
__Leonard Hmm?
__Penny Why are you telling me this now?
__Leonard Well, like I said, we're about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.
__Penny Really? Because to me, it seems like we're about to get married and you're trying to sabotage it.
__Leonard Would you rather I didn't tell you?
__Penny No, I don't want there to be secrets between us.
__Leonard See, now I'm confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?
__Penny Uh, keep your mouth off other women.
__Leonard I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that's it.
__Penny Okay.
__Penny Look, I'm not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren't engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.
__Leonard Right.
__Penny Just kissing.
__Leonard It wasn't even very good. She was a smoker, I'd just been seasick.
__Penny Okay, that's enough. Stop talking.
__Leonard So, we're still getting married?
__Penny Yes.
__Leonard Because we love each other.
__Penny Yes.
__Leonard And it's the happiest day of our lives.
__Penny Ha-ha, don't push it.
__Sheldon Hello. Listen, I've been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…
__Amy I've been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I've been incredibly patient for years.
__Sheldon Strongly disagree. Go on.
__Amy Okay, well, this isn't easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.
__Sheldon Oh.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Amy Bye, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?
__Leonard Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.
__Penny Why would we want that?
__Leonard ‘Cause there's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don't believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let's give them hope.
__Penny Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I've always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
__Leonard If you're not into this, we can do it another time.
__Penny No. No, I want to. Look, we've put this off long enough. Let's do it.
__Leonard Aw. That's exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.
__Sheldon Leonard, have you gotten married yet?
__Leonard No. Why?
__Sheldon Good. Don't do it.
__Leonard Why not?
__Leonard What happened now?
__Sheldon Amy has ended our relationship.
__Leonard Oh, no. Seriously?
__Penny What's going on?
__Leonard Amy broke up with Sheldon.
__Sheldon Is Penny crying?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.
__Leonard Buddy, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
__Sheldon Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.
__Leonard Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you're going through this with Amy doesn't mean that all women are bad.
__Sheldon Whatever.
__Penny Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?
__Amy Not really. Can you come over?
__Penny Uh, actually I'm in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.
__Amy Hold on. You're getting married and you didn't invite me?
__Penny Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.
__Amy Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.
__Penny Amy, don't be like that.
__Sheldon Why did I just hear Amy's name?
__Leonard Penny's on the phone with her.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny She's upset. Look, it's gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.
__Sheldon Amy's upset? Is it about me?
__Leonard No, I think it's because we're eloping.
__Sheldon Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy Oh. What are you doing here?
__Sheldon When last we spoke, you said you needed time.
__Amy Well, it's only been 11 hours.
__Sheldon The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.
__Amy Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk, I'll let you know.
__Sheldon Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?
__Amy Sure.
__Sheldon Boy, I'm glad we're going out again.
__Amy We're not back together.
__Sheldon Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn't wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?
__Amy If you must know, I'm going to Howard and Bernadette's to watch the wedding.
__Sheldon And who's this guy you're taking?
__Amy There's no guy.
__Sheldon Oh, you're going to a wedding alone? That's sad.
__Amy I'm not gonna be alone. I'll be with my friends.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Hey, if you're hungry, there's a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.
__Penny Thanks, but I don't like glitter on my scrambled eggs.
__Leonard I don't think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it's not how I pictured it either, but I'm still glad we're doing it.
__Penny Me, too.
__Leonard You sure?
__Penny Yes.
__Leonard And you promise you're okay with everything from the car?
__Penny Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?
__Leonard You're right. I'm sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?
__Penny What if they call our names?
__Penny Oh, and the fairy tale continues.
__Bernadette Our pleasure. You feeling okay?
__Amy We were together for so long, I honestly don't know what I'm feeling.
__Howard Well, that's understandable. You forgot. It's called happy.
__Bernadette Howard.
__Howard I'm not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.
__Stuart I know what you're going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.
__Amy Oh. What was her name?
__Stuart Hey, it's a true story. I don't need the third degree.
__Bernadette For God's sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?
__Sheldon I didn't want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I'll just stay out here and pretend that I don't have to go to the bathroom.
__Bernadette Howard, do something.
__Howard I'm on it.
__Amy Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.
__Sheldon I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?
__Amy They didn't invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.
__Raj Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
__Leonard Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.
__Official Where are the rose petals?!
__ Female Voice We're out
__ You know what? It's fine.
__Female Voice We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!
__Penny Really, we're good.
__Leonard Yup, just want to get married.
__Penny Yeah.
__Official Great. I'll see you two up there.
__Leonard This is it.
__Penny I know.
__Leonard I love you.
__Penny I love you, too.
__Female Voice Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?
__Penny No, thank you.
__Leonard We're good.
__Raj Didn't even crack the top ten.
__Sheldon Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.
__Amy I said I needed time to think.
__Raj I'm sure you guys will figure something out.
__Sheldon You hear that? Raj is devastated.
__Bernadette Sheldon, shh. The wedding's starting.
__Sheldon I see what's happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team, I pick Howard.
__Howard I'm not taking sides.
__Sheldon Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.
__Raj Really?
__Stuart At least you got picked.
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny No. You wrote vows?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Well, I don't have any. You're kind of making me look bad.
__Leonard It's okay. I don't have to say them.
__Penny No, no, no, go ahead. I'll come up with something mushy, you'll cry, we got this.
__Leonard Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.
__Penny Wow.
__Official Penny?
__Penny Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you're not only the love of my life. I mean, you're my best friend, and, you've got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got 'em, too. There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, 'cause you've got a friend in me.
__Official Is that the song from Toy Story?
__Penny He loves that movie.
__Leonard I do.
__Bernadette No, we totally won.
__Sheldon Amy, I don't understand, are we broken up or not? It's like you can't make up your mind.
__Amy It's because you're not giving me any space to think.
__Sheldon Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you're toting around have a sell-by date.
__Amy You know what, Sheldon, you've made this really easy. You're immature, you're selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don't need any more time to think. We're broken up.
__Bernadette Amy.
__Sheldon Will someone take me home?
__Raj Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a ride.
__ Official  …symbolizes your eternal love. I now pronounce you husband and wife.
__ We did it.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm so glad you guys could watch.
__Howard We'll say it was beautiful in the comment section.
__Penny Can you?
__Leonard Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
__Penny Okay, let's do it. You gonna make it?
__Leonard I'm okay.
__Penny Nicely done.
__Leonard Thank you. Finally, there's a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn't disappointed in me.
__Penny Well, the night is still young.
__Leonard Everything all right?
__Penny Yeah. I guess.
__Leonard Just tell me.
__Penny It's just, when we were kissing, I couldn't help but picture you with that other girl.
__Leonard Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.
__Penny You're right. Just forget it.
__Leonard Yeah. Okay, listen. If you're imagining that it was sexy, it wasn't. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.
__Penny Did you feel guilty?
__Leonard No, she had dental insurance.
__Penny Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
__Leonard Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.
__Penny What do you mean, every time you see her?
__Leonard What do I mean? Boy, that's a toughie.
__Penny You still see her?
__Leonard Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.
__Penny You work with her? How could you not tell me that?
__Leonard I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking
__Penny Oh, okay. So you're saying this is my fault?
__Leonard No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don't we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It's not easy. You try it.
__Mrs Cooper Shelly! How's my baby doing?
__Sheldon I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you're open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, what's going on?
__Sheldon She broke up with me.
__Sheldon No, I'll be okay. But I think that I'd like to send the ring back to you.
__Mrs Cooper Well, let's not be hasty. Are you sure it's over for good?
__Sheldon It's over for me. I'm done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.
__Mrs Cooper You want to tell me what happened?
__Sheldon Are you going to say it's all part of God's plan?
__Mrs Cooper Good chance.
__Sheldon Then no, thank you.
__Mrs Cooper Well, honey, don't send it back yet. Your sister's married, and I'm not letting your brother give my grandmother's ring to that whore he's dating.
__Sheldon Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
__Mrs Cooper When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.
__Amy Yeah.
__Howard Everything's gonna be okay.
__Stuart You've got so much to offer.
__Amy Thank you.
__Stuart Any man would be lucky to have you.
__Bernadette That's true.
__Amy I just hope I did the right thing.
__Amy Like you're doing right now?
__Stuart Exactly.
__Penny I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.
__Leonard Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.
__Leonard I'm not glowing. I'm upset.
__Sheldon Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.
__Penny What's this?
__Sheldon Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.
__Penny Oh. That's so sweet of you.
__Sheldon Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn't enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.
__Penny I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.
__Sheldon Well, I'm sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.
__Penny You know, it's bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.
__Penny Some girl named Mandy.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Oh, you don't need to worry about her. She's brilliant and attractive. She can do way better
__ than Leonard.
__ That's great.
__Sheldon Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I'm on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.
__Penny That's ridiculous.
__Sheldon Oh, you're right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she'd be with Leonard.
__Penny I'm with Leonard.
__Sheldon Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?
__Penny Right? I can't believe Amy actually went through with it.
__Penny I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
__Sheldon Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?
__Penny Okay, look, it's not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.
__Sheldon I see. Well, I think I'll be going.
__Penny Sheldon.
__Sheldon No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?
__Penny Sure.
__Sheldon Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.
__Bernadette What happened? They just got married.
__Howard I don't know. It's a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.
__Bernadette Think they'll break up?
__Howard I don't know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny's back in her apartment all by herself.
__Stuart Really?
__Leonard Sure, let's make it an even hundred.
__Sheldon You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.
__Leonard I wouldn't.
__Sheldon And you know why? ‘Cause you're a man. The champagne of genders.
__Leonard Well, I may be a man, but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I'll just have a salad. You know? Where's my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.
__Leonard I figured that out.
__Sheldon You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.
__Leonard Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.
__Leonard How am I supposed to sleep? I've been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn't speaking to me.
__Sheldon Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you've managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny You couldn't sleep either?
__Leonard Of course not.
__Sheldon Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.
__Leonard What are we gonna do?
__Penny I don't know.
__Leonard Please, tell me how I can fix it.
__Sheldon Glad you asked. As I see it, there's a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.
__Leonard Okay, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
__Penny Actually, I think he's onto something.
__Leonard You can't be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you're gonna do the same with a random guy?
__Sheldon I'm currently single.
__Penny That's true. You are.
__Leonard What is happening?
__Sheldon I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend's marriage.
__Leonard U-u-u-uh!
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Well, hello to you, too.
__Amy What do you want?
__Sheldon I understand we're no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.
__Amy What baby?
__Sheldon A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.
__Amy I'm hanging up.
__Sheldon Great. See you in about half an hour.
__Amy Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.
__Sheldon Why not?
__Amy Because we're broken up.
__Sheldon Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.
__Amy No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.
__Sheldon You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, 'cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.
__Amy Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it's hard. It's hard for me, too. But I've seen and talked to you more in the two days we've been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.
__Sheldon Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.
__Leonard Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.
__Raj And you knew about this this whole time?
__Howard I did.
__Raj And you didn't think to tell me?
__Howard Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.
__Raj Let's leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.
__Leonard Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?
__Raj Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?
__Howard You think it's hard having one wife, try having two.
__Raj I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.
__Leonard Oh, we didn't screw around. We just got drunk and made out.
__Raj Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.
__Sheldon I'm here to return your belongings. That's what people who've broken up do.
__Amy And you didn't do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.
__Sheldon On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We're not friends with benefits.
__Amy Just give me the box.
__Sheldon Wait. Don't you want to go through it to make sure I haven't forgotten anything?
__Amy Fine. My old scarf.
__Sheldon You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
__Amy You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?
__Sheldon We made one heck of a team, huh?
__Amy Whose bra is this?
__Sheldon It's not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.
__Amy It's Penny's.
__Sheldon Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I'm smooshing around like pizza dough.
__Amy Good-bye.
__Sheldon Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.
__Bernadette Hands off. I'm mad at you.
__Howard Look, I know it's a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it'll pay for itself.
__Bernadette What will pay for itself?
__Howard Doesn't matter. What are you mad about?
__Bernadette I'm mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I'm mad that I've had to hide this from Penny for two years.
__Howard And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don't you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don't even look at it.
__Bernadette I mean, if Penny finds out I've known all this time and haven't told her, she's gonna think I'm a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.
__Bernadette I guess that's true.
__Howard And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?
__Penny Hi.
__Leonard Call you back. Hey.
__Penny Can we talk?
__Leonard I would love that.
__Penny All right, look, I'm sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we're going through this, but I don't know what to do.
__Leonard If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?
__Sheldon Oh, of course. Wouldn't want to intrude. This is yours.
__Penny Okay, when I'm done with him, I'm gonna need more information.
__Sheldon Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy's nose in it.
__Penny Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you're gonna go to work and see this woman?
__Sheldon Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there's a simple solution.
__Leonard Wake up, wake up, wake up.
__Sheldon Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
__Leonard What? Why?
__Sheldon Well, right now, Penny's imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.
__Leonard Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.
__Sheldon And we learned that you don't need an eyeball to do that.
__Leonard Secondly, I can't think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.
__Penny Really? Why is that?
__Leonard What, you actually want to meet her?
__Penny No, but now that you're being weird about it, maybe I should.
__Leonard I'm not being weird. Am I being weird?
__Sheldon Yes. And that's coming from me.
__Leonard Fine, you want to meet her?
__Penny No, I just want to know that when you're at work, there's nothing going on.
__Leonard How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
__Penny Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.
__Sheldon In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that's unlikely.
__Amy Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
__Penny What do you think?
__Bernadette I don't know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.
__Penny You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn't anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren't above cheating because that's usually how we met.
__Penny I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?
__Bernadette Oh, I don't know. This is all so new to me. I'm still processing.
__Penny You know, he never would've done this when we first met. He's cockier now.
__Amy That's because you made him more confident.
__Bernadette You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would've grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it's better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn't have any other choice.
__Penny I never thought about it like that.
__Bernadette Oh, me neither, not until just now.
__Howard 250 dollars an hour. Why?
__Raj How do you know?
__Howard Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.
__Raj And I'm just hearing about this now?
__Howard Dude, just because we're best friends doesn't mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.
__Raj You don't have to, you should want to.
__Leonard Oh, great, there's Mandy.
__Howard Why are marine biologists always so cute?
__Raj I don't know, but I'd like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.
__Leonard That's not helpful.
__Howard Then I won't say I'd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
__Leonard Are we done?
__Raj Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I'd let her free my willy. Where you going?
__Leonard I'm gonna ask her if she'd be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.
__Howard Leonard, wait.
__Leonard What?
__Howard I'd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.
__Raj Now we are done.
__Leonard Hey.
__Mandy Oh, hi, Leonard. What's up?
__Leonard Uh, do you mind if I sit?
__Mandy Sure.
__Leonard So, um, I've been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.
__Mandy What about it?
__Leonard You know, what we did, when we were drunk.
__Mandy Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?
__Leonard No, we just made out.
__Mandy Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?
__Leonard Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
__Leonard Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she's concerned about us seeing each other at work.
__Mandy It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?
__Leonard Because I didn't want there to be any secrets between us.
__Mandy Is that really the reason?
__Leonard What else would it be?
__Mandy I don't know. Sounds like you're trying to sabotage the relationship.
__Leonard No, I don't think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.
__Mandy Okay, well, that's something to think about.
__Leonard You know, on some level, I've always believed that I don't deserve a woman like her.
__Mandy Oh, you're gonna think about that right here?
__Leonard I mean, she's really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.
__Mandy Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.
__Leonard Too expensive. You'd think I'd be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn't have any interest in me.
__Mandy Imagine that.
__Leonard I wonder if that's why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon's head on it.
__Mandy And your wife is worried about me?
__Raj Hey, Leonard, when you're done, we came up with a bunch more.
__Amy I'm gonna kill him.
__Sheldon But enough about the Czech Republic. Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn't. And yet Romania gets dumped. I'll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?
__Leonard Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?
__Penny Uh-huh.
__Penny I'm listening.
__Leonard Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don't deserve you.
__Penny Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could've possibly come up with. But I get it.
__Leonard You do?
__Penny Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you're gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.
__Leonard I don't even understand why you're with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?
__Penny You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I've been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.
__Leonard Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?
__Penny That sounds nice.
__Leonard Good. Because I've loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.
__Penny Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.
__Leonard Yeah? That's because you're beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.
__Penny It's getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.
__Penny Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?
__Leonard Yes, please.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon I don't know why you're so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.
__Leonard What is this?
__Sheldon Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard Wow.
__Penny That's so great.
__Sheldon Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We're gonna have so much fun.
__Penny We?
__Sheldon Is there a problem?
__Penny Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.
__Amy How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?
__Sheldon You saw through that one, did you?
__Amy I don't know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.
__Sheldon She watched it. I'm gonna get that girl back.
__Amy I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
__Sheldon She was listening through the door. She wants me.
__Leonard Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?
__Sheldon Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.
__Raj Hey, there.
__Leonard Hey, you're early. The movie doesn't start for an hour.
__Howard Actually, we're not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.
__Leonard What are you talking about?
__Raj Well, you eloped and we didn't get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there's a van downstairs and we're here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.
__Sheldon Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping. Where's the blindfold? Where's the duct tape? Where's the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I'm getting too old for this crud?
__Leonard When do we leave?
__Howard Right now.
__Howard Wow, okay.
__Sheldon You're seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
__Raj Oh, not just him, you're coming, too.
__Sheldon Oh, and how do you think you're going to get me to do that?
__Howard I told you to put tape on his mouth.
__Raj And I told you he bit me.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Well, Sheldon, there's something about this van that you're going to find very interesting.
__Sheldon It runs on syphilis?
__Sheldon No.
__Howard Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
__Leonard This was Feynman's van? That's so cool.
__Raj Yeah, nothing's been changed since he drove it.
__Howard I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
__Sheldon Yeah, and talked about physics with them.
__Leonard So, are you gonna give us a clue where we're headed?
__Leonard India.
__Raj We can drive there.
__Howard We are going to Me-hi-co.
__Leonard Fun, I've never been there.
__Sheldon Leonard, don't be fooled. I'm from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.
__Raj What's wrong with Mexico?
__Sheldon Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around 'cause there's a worm inside.
__Howard Okay, calm down. There's a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman's van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.
__Sheldon Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.
__Penny Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard's in the shower.
__Amy Hi.
__Penny Hey.
__Amy I know we're not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.
__Penny You really didn't have to, whoa! That is anatomic.
__Amy Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.
__Bernadette Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.
__Amy I had extra dough.
__Penny Oh, that's Leonard. He said they're about to cross the border.
__Bernadette I hope the boys don't get too crazy in Mexico.
__Penny Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.
__Amy Boy, that was a long night for me.
__Raj We don't have any of those.
__Sheldon How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.
__Leonard If there was a hidden compartment, don't you think you'd be stuffed in it by now?
__Sheldon Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
__Howard You don't need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.
__Sheldon You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.
__Penny Oh, it's good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.
__Bernadette You guys still aren't living together?
__Penny We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it's only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.
__Bernadette Speaking of Sheldon, how's single life treating you?
__Penny Yes.
__Bernadette Good for you.
__Amy But then I decided I don't want to go changing who I am just because of some man.
__Penny Yes.
__Bernadette Good for you.
__Amy Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.
__Bernadette Your sweater?
__Penny Your glasses?
__Bernadette Your hair?
__Penny Your shoes.
__Amy Piercing my ears.
__Penny Oh.
__Bernadette You really never had that done?
__Amy My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.
__Penny Okay, well, you're a grown woman now.
__Bernadette We'll take you to the mall to get it done.
__Penny Why? I can do it right here.
__Amy Really? You have a piercing gun?
__Penny No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I've done it, like, a dozen times.
__Amy Oh, I don't know.
__Penny Oh, come on. I'll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.
__Bernadette This party's weird.
__Howard Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver's seat and slap a sombrero on his head.
__Raj Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?
__Howard I don't know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?
__Leonard Sheldon, can you believe that we're driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It's like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn't cool.
__Sheldon It is extraordinary.
__Sheldon I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.
__Howard Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.
__Sheldon What was that?
__Sheldon What if it's banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?
__Howard It's the tyre.
__Sheldon Leonard?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I am getting too old for this crud.
__Amy You're right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I'm no longer in a relationship.
__Bernadette Did you change yours to married yet?
__Penny Uh, no, not yet. There's still a few people I haven't told personally.
__Amy Who?
__Penny Oh, just my parents and my entire family.
__Bernadette What?
__Amy Why?
__Penny Well, I don't want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.
__Bernadette What about your sister's wedding?
__Penny They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it's gonna break his heart.
__Amy How long do you think you can keep it from him?
__Bernadette Yeah, isn't it gonna get worse the longer you wait?
__Penny Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad's not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I'll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.
__Howard Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
__Sheldon If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone's shoulders and never coming down.
__Leonard And there's your damsel.
__Howard Wow, this one's really stuck.
__Raj Are you turning it the right way?
__Howard No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I'm in a rut, let's shake things up.
__Raj Here, let me try. You're right, it doesn't turn the other way.
__Amy That wasn't so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she'd lock me in the sin closet.
__Bernadette That's a joke, right?
__Amy Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.
__Penny I'm starting to see why you and your mom aren't very close.
__Bernadette Bet she'd still tell her if she got married.
__Penny You're not gonna let this go, are you?
__Amy Well, it's kind of sad that they don't know. I mean, they love Leonard.
__Penny Fine, you want me to call? I'll call. Why am I so nervous?
__Bernadette It's understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.
__Penny Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
__Amy Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven't told her yet.
__Penny You've been giving me a hard time and you haven't even told your mom about Sheldon?
__Amy I'm feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don't know what you're talking about.
__Penny Fine. I'm calling home, but when I'm done, you're calling your mother.
__Amy Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.
__Penny Hey, Daddy.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Hey, slugger. How's my girl?
__Penny Uh, good. Is Mom around?
__Penny's Dad Penny' Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she's gonna make him a little necklace.
__Penny Okay, I'll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there's something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.
__Penny's Dad Penny' You did? When?
__Penny Last week. I'm sorry, I should've told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don't be too disappointed.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Are you happy?
__Penny Very. Leonard is so great.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Well, then I'm happy for you.
__Penny Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Well, I understand it's hard to tell someone something if you think it's gonna upset 'em.
__Penny It is. You're the best dad ever.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I've been sitting on a little news myself.
__Penny Well, what is it?
__Penny's Dad Penny' You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?
__Penny No.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.
__Penny Moondance?
__Penny's Dad Penny' Yeah, he's, uh, not dancing anymore.
__Penny You killed my pig?
__Penny's Dad Penny' I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.
__Penny When?
__Penny You didn't tell me for a year?
__Penny's Dad Penny' Well, apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.
__Bernadette Okay, Amy, your turn.
__Raj It's called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.
__Howard Great. He's pushing with his uterus.
__Raj There's got to be a smarter way of removing it.
__Leonard Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.
__Sheldon Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.
__Raj Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
__Howard Exactly. I'll bet there's something around here that could be a lever.
__Leonard Let's see, a lever, a lever.
__Sheldon Everybody hold on. Let's take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we're calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it's leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.
__Leonard We're gonna be here foreever.
__Bernadette Really? They didn't eat him?
__Penny No. He was a beloved member of the family.
__Bernadette The breakfast meat family?
__Amy Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.
__Penny Phone, now.
__Amy Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.
__Penny Try dialing.
__Amy You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How's work? That's nice. I'm fine. Hey, listen, I've been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?
__Penny Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.
__Howard What makes you say that?
__Leonard There's gotta be something else we could try.
__Raj If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.
__Sheldon Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.
__Raj If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?
__Sheldon Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.
__Leonard Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn't a perfectly reasonable choice, but we're scientists. Don't you think we can figure this out using actual science?
__Sheldon Yes, we could use science. But it's your bachelor party. Lighten up.
__Caption Percussive Shock.
__Howard We will, we will percussive shock you.
__Howard and Raj We will, we will percussive shock you.
__Sheldon Buddy you're a boy, make a big noise playin' in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin' your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it's a curse.
__Caption Thermal Expansion.
__Raj I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
__Leonard They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let's hope the lug nut expands.
__Sheldon What if that burning food attracts animals?
__Howard We have plenty of food for the animals.
__Sheldon We do?
__Howard Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.
__Sheldon That's not very nice.
__Leonard It's a bachelor party. Lighten up.
__Caption Accelerated Corrosion.
__Sheldon What is that awful smell?
__Howard It's burning salsa. I'm hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
__Sheldon What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don't give your MIT education enough credit.
__Howard Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.
__Caption Exothermic Reaction.
__Sheldon All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.
__Howard Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
__Leonard Well, let's start small. We can always add more.
__Howard You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you've met your match.
__Leonard We got a flat and couldn't get the tyre off.
__Penny Oh, I'm sorry.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy's ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.
__Sheldon We blew up Feynman's van.
__Penny My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
__Leonard I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.
__Penny You win.
__Penny Oh, we're glad you had fun.
__Sheldon Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It's like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.
__Leonard I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie. You're a young man.
__Sheldon Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I'm 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?
__Leonard It's just where I need them. You know, she doesn't have a lot of closet space.
__Sheldon What's wrong with your closet?
__Penny Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.
__Sheldon So that's all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
__Leonard Come on, buddy.
__Sheldon No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might've said yes.
__Penny Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.
__Sheldon You know what they don't sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.
__ Credits sequence.
__Bernadette Of course.
__Sheldon As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I'm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.
__Bernadette Aw. I'm honoured.
__Sheldon I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard's mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.
__Bernadette So, I'm your seventh choice.
__Sheldon Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.
__Bernadette How can I help you?
__Sheldon Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard's moving in with Penny. It's difficult not to feel abandoned.
__Bernadette Well, why don't you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.
__Sheldon Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt's all the rage right now. I wonder how he'd feel about taking the smaller bedroom.
__Stuart Hey.
__Bernadette Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?
__Sheldon Gandalf, but he's a smoker.
__Bernadette Stuart. He's been living with us for a while now. I'm sure he'd love to get us out of his hair.
__Stuart Nope, couldn't be happier.
__Bernadette Well, Sheldon's looking for a roommate.
__Stuart Nope.
__Bernadette He'll think about it.
__Stuart No I won't.
__Howard How could Archie defeat Predator?
__Raj I don't know. Maybe Jughead's a Terminator.
__Stuart Hey.
__Howard Hey, Stuart.
__Stuart Do you guys know any musicians?
__Howard Why?
__Stuart I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a staying in business vibe.
__Howard What kind of music are you thinking of?
__Stuart I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is free.
__Raj Hey, we've always talked about playing together.
__Howard Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.
__Raj Oh, we could play filk music.
__Raj It's been around for years. It's like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.
__Stuart I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn't be expected to pay for.
__Raj Dude, if we do this, we're gonna need a cool band name.
__Howard You know, I've actually had one I've been sitting on for years.
__Raj Really?
__Howard It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.
__Raj What is it?
__Howard Footprints on the Moon.
__Raj I just got chills.
__Howard So did I.
__Penny I'm proud of you. You're taking this really well.
__Sheldon Well, it's not like I'm never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.
__Sheldon No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that's on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that's left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.
__Penny What's the matter?
__Leonard It's harder than I thought.
__Sheldon Let me help you. L. E. O. N.
__Leonard That helped.
__Howard Is it cold in here, 'cause, oh, my.
__Raj Okay, so it's a, it's a David and Goliath story. It's about man against God. It's called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.
__Howard Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.
__Raj Okay, I don't have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that's no man, it's a Norse god.
__Howard Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that's one bad mamma-jamma.
__Raj That is, that is so good!
__Howard Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.
__Raj Okay, and here's the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.
__Together Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.
__Howard Oh, man, that rocks.
__Raj Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?
__Howard Yeah?
__Raj That's how much we're gonna melt people's faces off.
__Bespectacled Man Sure.
__Sheldon It says here you're a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?
__Bespectacled Man Is that supposed to be a joke?
__Sheldon Looks like argon's not the only one with an attitude problem.
__ Fade to another candidate.
__ In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?
__ Fade to another candidate.
__ I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?
__ Fade to another candidate.
__ You're healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I've got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you're the frontrunner.
__Sheldon But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.
__Amy I'm sure you'll find somebody else.
__Sheldon I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I'd say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?
__Amy I don't know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.
__Sheldon They didn't used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.
__Amy I don't think that was the point of the movie.
__Sheldon Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.
__Amy There you go.
__Leonard Well, it's Thai food night.
__Penny Well, honey, you don't live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.
__Leonard You're right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?
__Penny How about Thai food?
__Leonard Oh, thank God.
__Penny Hey, we're going to dinner. You want to come?
__Sheldon Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I'm restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.
__Leonard You heard him, no.
__Penny Hang on. Wait, you actually think it's 2003?
__Sheldon No, just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional. And since it is 2003, I don't know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.
__Leonard I guess. I'm just, you know, worried about Sheldon.
__Penny Well, come on, he's a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He's fine.
__Leonard I hope so.
__Penny What else can you do? Move back in with him?
__Leonard No, of course not. I just feel bad.
__Penny Well, so do I, but don't you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it's time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?
__Leonard I did like that he had the weather on it.
__Penny Trust me, this is the right thing.
__Leonard I know. And it's not like we're abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.
__Bernadette Hey, if you're open to living with someone great, I'll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.
__Amy You really should've gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.
__Amy Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky, but he's also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.
__Leonard Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?
__Sheldon In my present, it's in the future. In your present, it's been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.
__Leonard I know what you're doing. You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you, but it's not happening.
__Sheldon No, what I'm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.
__Leonard Will you knock it off? We're across the hall.
__Sheldon As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.
__Penny They're not saying that.
__Sheldon They are in 2003.
__Penny No, no, they're really not.
__Emily Wow.
__Raj Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn't rhyme anything with boulder.
__Emily Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.
__Raj Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?
__Raj Cute? It's not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.
__Emily Okay, fine, it's not cute.
__Raj Just be honest. You don't like it.
__Emily I didn't say that. I, I just like music you can dance to.
__Raj You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.
__Raj You can do both, like Michael Jackson's Billie Jean. While you're dancing you're thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?
__Howard Where's this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.
__Raj I still love it. I just think there's room for improvement.
__Howard You played it for Emily, didn't you?
__Raj Yeah, so what?
__Howard You are such a wimp. She didn't like it, now you don't like it.
__Raj No, no. I'm just evolving as a musician. You're the one who's stuck in the past.
__Howard The past was lunch. You know what's really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.
__Raj She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.
__Howard Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever's willing to sleep with you.
__Raj That is so not true.
__Howard Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?
__Howard I don't need this. I'm quitting the band.
__Raj Fine, I quit, too.
__Howard Then get out of my house.
__Raj With pleasure.
__Howard Raj, wait.
__Raj What took you so long?
__Sheldon How can you say that? Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.
__Penny Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.
__Sheldon No, I do. Eventually you'll want more space, and you'll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it'll only be a couple of times a month, and then it'll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali's weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy's wedding, where she's marrying someone better than me.
__Penny Okay, look, we don't need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we'll sleep over there, and sometimes we'll sleep over here.
__Sheldon But mostly here.
__Leonard Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?
__Penny Well, it's not forever. It's just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he's our dog.
__Sheldon You can. I'm happy when you come home. And I'm scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we're all sleeping here.
__Leonard Fine.
__Sheldon All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I'll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we're good.
__Raj It was Avenger versus archeologist.
__Howard Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.
__Raj Thor said, that's a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.
__Together Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.
__Stuart Play something we can dance to.
__Howard Oh, one sec.
__Sheldon Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
__Howard No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I'm exercising.
__Leonard That'll teach her to care about your health.
__Howard Yeah, I can't wait to see the look on her face when I die young.
__Raj When was the last actual exercise you got?
__Howard The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.
__Sheldon According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.
__Raj Are you?
__Sheldon Nah, I'll do it tomorrow.
__Leonard It wouldn't be the worst thing if we were more active.
__Howard You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I'm getting a runner's high.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Had me at flag, lost me at football.
__Penny Yeah, I think it's great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?
__Leonard What are you saying? We're not coordinated enough to play sports?
__Penny Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.
__Leonard I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that's not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what's the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.
__Sheldon Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
__Leonard It's indoors, so no sunscreen.
__Sheldon No throwing, no catching, no running.
__Leonard No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
__Sheldon Or worse, up.
__Leonard Preach.
__Sheldon And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.
__Leonard What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
__Bernadette Sure. So how can we help?
__Stuart Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can't get 'em in here.
__Penny All right, well, what have you tried so far?
__Stuart Uh, I've, I've been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.
__Penny Really? In a comic book store?
__Stuart Oh, don't worry. I, I've got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren't being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?
__Amy Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman's actually on a leash like a dog.
__Stuart Well, you don't know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.
__Leonard I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
__Sheldon Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don't have.
__Raj We can still be swashers.
__Howard Well said, Puss.
__Barry Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn't a joke. I hope you're not here because you think it's going to be wike Star Wars.
__Leonard That's not why we're here.
__Raj Yeah, I'm here because I think it's gonna be like Game of Thrones.
__Howard And maybe a little Princess Bride.
__Raj Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That's my answer.
__Barry Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you're not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.
__Sheldon We're not afraid of physical activity.
__Howard Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.
__Barry Awwight. Let's begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.
__Sheldon Oh, dear.
__Barry What's wong, Cooper?
__Sheldon Well, I'm not sure I have a dominant leg. They're both pretty submissive.
__Howard When you're in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?
__Sheldon Right. Always right.
__Howard He's a righty.
__Barry Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.
__Howard Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.
__Barry The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.
__Leonard This is easy. I didn't need to wear a cup.
__Barry Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.
__Sheldon Excuse me, Barry?
__Barry Yes.
__Sheldon When can I stab one of my friends?
__Sheldon Uh, yes, I'm aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I'll get called into Human Resources.
__Barry Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee.  Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I'm teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.
__Stuart Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don't be afraid.
__Penny Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?
__Stuart Eh, the Internet's so negative. I try to avoid it.
__Penny All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn't blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.
__Stuart See? Negative.
__Raj Look at us. We're like the Rockettes.
__Sheldon En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.
__Howard My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
__Raj My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
__Howard I thought you were Puss in Boots.
__Raj Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
__Sheldon I'm looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.
__Leonard When was your honour insulted?
__Sheldon My last physical.
__Leonard Again, that doctor didn't insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.
__Raj My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
__Howard My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.
__Sheldon Ah, this is fun.
__Leonard Well, good. It's nice to see your mind off Amy.
__Barry What's going on with Amy?
__Sheldon Not that it's any of your business, but she broke up with me.
__Barry Weawwy? Good to know.
__Sheldon Good to know? What's that supposed to mean?
__Leonard Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he's interested in her.
__Sheldon Well, that's unacceptable.
__Leonard Oh, buddy, I get that you don't like it, but it's not really up to you.
__Sheldon Yeah, but he's dumb, and his face is dumb.
__Leonard Look, even if it's not him, Amy's probably going to date someone at some point.
__Sheldon You really think so?
__Leonard Of course. She deserves to be happy.
__Sheldon How dare you.
__Sheldon Barry, a word?
__Leonard And now the crazy version of what I just said.
__Sheldon If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.
__Barry And how are you gonna do that?
__Sheldon By challenging you to a duel.
__Barry You've had one wesson. I'll destwoy you.
__Sheldon That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you're worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I'm going to touch you all over.
__Leonard Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.
__Penny Yeah.
__Bernadette You are.
__Amy You can say it.
__Stuart Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.
__Penny Well, you're talking to us now. I mean, you don't seem nervous.
__Stuart Well, that's 'cause I'm doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.
__Amy Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
__Stuart It was a joke.
__Bernadette Was it?
__Stuart No, I'm still doing it.
__Penny Okay. Don't be offended, but, what went wrong with you?
__Bernadette That really happened?
__Stuart I mean, I can't say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I'm alone, the more desperate I get.
__Amy Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.
__Amy Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.
__Sheldon Look at this blister. Like it or not, we're athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I'm having female problems.
__Leonard If you're cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.
__Howard Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.
__Sheldon That's ridiculous.
__Raj Why? You never thought you'd end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there's someone else out there for you.
__Sheldon True, but Penny's married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.
__Leonard Maybe you should consider women who aren't in serious relationships with your closest friends?
__Sheldon There's that prostate doctor, but I'm still mad at her. Oh, there's a woman. I'll make her my girlfriend.
__Raj Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn't work.
__Sheldon You're forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
__Raj How many sips of that beer did he have?
__Leonard Three.
__Howard Oh, boy.
__Sheldon Excuse me. I'm recovering from a recent breakup, and I'm told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.
__Woman What?
__Sheldon It's a Pokémon reference.
__Woman I don't know what that means.
__Sheldon Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?
__Older woman I'm married, and I'm her grandmother.
__Sheldon Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.
__Penny Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.
__Amy I don't have much experience turning men down. It wasn't so much fun.
__Bernadette Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.
__Penny And sometimes we marry them anyway.
__Amy Huh. Well, this is weird.
__Penny What?
__Amy Barry Kripke just asked me out.
__Penny I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
__Bernadette What did he say?
__Amy Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you'd like to get a drink after work sometime.
__Penny Well, what are you gonna do?
__Amy I don't know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.
__Bernadette What can it hurt?
__Amy Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.
__Bernadette You mean, not a scientist?
__Penny I think she means not a weirdo.
__Bernadette Are you attracted to him?
__Amy I don't know.
__Penny All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?
__Amy Oh, I don't have to imagine it.
__Leonard You're just sweaty from exercise.
__Sheldon And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
__Leonard I know it only takes one doctor's finger.
__Amy Hello.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard We should let you guys talk.
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Sheldon You don't have to leave.
__Leonard Look at me go.
__Amy Uh, Bernadette, you're my ride.
__Bernadette Walk.
__Amy How have you been?
__Sheldon I'm doing all right. I tried fencing today.
__Sheldon It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
__Amy Well, actually, he, he already did.
__Sheldon Okay. But don't get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he's a dead man.
__Amy I said no.
__Sheldon Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.
__Amy I didn't know you were interested in dating.
__Sheldon I've been told it's a good way to move on.
__Amy Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it's nice to see you. You look good.
__Sheldon Thanks. And I taste good too.
__Howard What's up?
__Bernadette Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
__Leonard What's going on?
__Sheldon Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You're face is pleasingly symmetrical.
__Leonard Just tell me.
__Sheldon A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
__Leonard Oh, well, that kind of stinks.
__Sheldon That kind of stinks? Why aren't you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
__Leonard What are we going to do?
__Sheldon Perform the experiment immediately.
__Leonard I'd love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment's on back order for a month.
__Sheldon A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
__Leonard That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
__Sheldon Thank you. Aren't you sweet.
__Leonard Let's go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
__Sheldon Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today?
__Barry Sowwy, there's a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.
__Sheldon But you won't need much for that.
__Barry Twue, but if it's successful, I'm having a pawty with bawwoons.
__Leonard Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can't you spare any?
__Barry Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Not a chance.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn't your mother tell you? It's the best policy. So, what do you say?
__Barry Hell no.
__Sheldon He could've softened the blow.
__Leonard We'd have to go to every Party City in California.
__Howard Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.
__Raj Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.
__Sheldon Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.
__Howard If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.
__Leonard Who is he?
__Sheldon Where does he work?
__Leonard How does he get the helium?
__Sheldon How many questions are too many questions?
__Howard Maybe he's not for you.
__Sheldon Four questions. There answer's four.
__Penny Oh, good for him.
__Bernadette I thought so, too.
__Penny So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?
__Bernadette He's using some kind of dating app on his phone.
__Penny Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.
__Bernadette I don't know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.
__Penny Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.
__Stuart What's up?
__Bernadette Can you show us that dating app?
__Stuart Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.
__Penny Wow. So how many girls have you met?
__Stuart Two. I probably don't need to mention there's an entire number between that and zero.
__Penny Well, so how does it work?
__Stuart Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don't, thumbs down.
__Bernadette Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?
__Stuart First time it happens I will let you know.
__Sheldon What's he say?
__Leonard He's got what we need and can meet us tonight.
__Sheldon Really? You know I don't like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph's at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin' Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?
__Leonard The man restocking the cereal shelves.
__Sheldon That's right. And what did he do?
__Leonard He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.
__Sheldon It's like it was yesterday.
__Sheldon Of course I do. I don't want that Swedish team scooping us.
__Leonard Then I'm going to tell him we're in.
__Sheldon Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.
__Leonard We're just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we're going to spend it on the helium we need. It's not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.
__Sheldon Was she helping him with his research?
__Leonard Sure. So, are we doing this?
__Sheldon Well, but where does he get the helium?
__Leonard Remember? Don't ask too many questions?
__Sheldon Uh, but this is violating university code.
__Leonard A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.
__Sheldon Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we're in.
__Leonard Done.
__Sheldon I can't find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
__Leonard Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.
__Sheldon Aren't you just made of sugar.
__Penny Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.
__Bernadette Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.
__Stuart One of which would've ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.
__Penny Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he's cute.
__Bernadette Doesn't a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
__Penny And he's sad about it.
__Howard Hey.
__Raj Hello.
__Penny Hey.
__Bernadette Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?
__Howard If you wanted me to stay out later, you should've given me more spending money.
__Raj What are you guys up to?
__Bernadette We put Amy on a dating app, and we're seeing what's out there.
__Raj Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.
__Howard What was wrong with that guy?
__Raj Uh, he's Indian. We've already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.
__Howard Hey, I want to try.
__Amy Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?
__Howard Hang on, I'm trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?
__Sheldon Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.
__Leonard Hey.
__Man What's up?
__Leonard Uh, I'm Leonard. This is my friend…
__Man Great. You got the cash?
__Leonard Uh, yeah, uh, right here.
__Sheldon Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you're not gonna take the money and drive away?
__Leonard What ya doing, Skippy?
__Sheldon Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.
__Man Oh, how do I know you're not gonna drive away without paying me?
__Sheldon Guess I'm not the only one who watches '70s television crime dramas.
__Leonard Look, you can trust us. We're respected scientists.
__Sheldon Well, he is. I'm a wedding planner who can't find love himself. It's ironic, but the point is we can't trust you. You're a sketchy character in a parking garage.
__Man Yeah, well, from my perspective, that's how you two appear to me.
__Sheldon Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won't it?
__Leonard My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don't feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
__Sheldon Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you're only limited by your imagination.
__Man Huh. All these years I've been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.
__Leonard I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
__Man Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.
__Sheldon Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.
__Man Hmm, I don't follow.
__Sheldon Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I'll turn you in to the authorities.
__Man Is that a threat?
__Sheldon Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.
__Man Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I'll report you, then I'll pound your asses into the ground.
__Sheldon Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I've won the battle but lost the war?
__Leonard Afraid so, Skippy.
__Sheldon I told you we shouldn't go shopping at night.
__Leonard All right, let's all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.
__Man No, I don't like this. I'm out.
__Leonard No, no, no. Wait, don't go. Just let me explain. We're physicists, and we're trying to prove a hypothesis that we've been working on for over a year.
__Man Really? What's the hypothesis?
__Sheldon Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
__Man Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.
__Leonard Okay, but now there's this Swedish team that read our paper and they're trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.
__Sheldon And I'm sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can't find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.
__Leonard Here's the money. Can we do this?
__Man Okay. It's a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.
__Leonard It's actually pretty common in our field. There's not much you can do about it.
__Man Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there's, uh, plenty we could do about it.
__Sheldon Did you hear that, Leonard? There's plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?
__Raj You know he won't be looking at other girls.
__Howard Unless they're sitting on the end of his nose.
__Penny Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.
__Bernadette Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.
__Penny Well if he's good in bed, she can throw him a fish.
__Howard I love you, Amy.
__Amy Okay, I'm starting to feel guilty. Aren't we being a little mean?
__Raj That's a fair point. We wouldn't make fun of someone like this to their face.
__Penny Look, it's Stuart.
__Raj You may want to leave the room.
__Leonard Will you stop with that already?
__Sheldon I'm trying not to attract attention.
__Leonard And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?
__Sheldon She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
__Leonard Let's just start the experiment.
__Sheldon Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.
__Leonard We're not getting caught.
__Sheldon Well, you can't be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey?
__Leonard The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.
__Sheldon Uh-oh.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Well, did you see this sticker?
__Leonard What is it?
__Sheldon It's partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.
__Leonard It's probably USC or UCLA.
__Sheldon Yeah, but what if it's Property of U.S. Government? There's a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we're accessories to a federal crime.
__Leonard Let's not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.
__Sheldon That's true. There's the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.
__Leonard Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.
__Raj I have that same underwear.
__Penny Chug.
__Penny Amy, you're getting a text.
__Amy Oh, um, give me that.
__Raj I had a great time last night.
__Amy No, no, stop reading that.
__Howard Who's Dave?
__Penny You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?
__Amy No, it, it's not like that.
__Bernadette And I'd love to take you out again”?
__All Amy/What?/Can't believe it/Oh, my God.
__Amy Okay, it's like that.
__Man Yeah, well, normally I wouldn't, but my daughter's having a sleepover, and there's only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.
__Sheldon Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we'll be on our way.
__Man Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?
__Sheldon He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.
__Man Yeah, I hear you. Well, you're good guys, so I'll, uh, I'll take the helium off your hands.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Man But you ain't getting your money back.
__Sheldon You're taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.
__Man Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.
__Leonard You know what? It's fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.
__Man No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.
__Sheldon I don't understand.
__Leonard He wants more money.
__Sheldon Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That's all I've got on me.
__Man That's exactly how much it is.
__Sheldon Finally, something breaks our way.
__Bernadette Yeah, why wouldn't you tell us?
__Amy Because it's new and weird and I'm just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you'd get way too excited about it.
__Bernadette What?
__Penny Amy.
__Stuart So, are we allowed to ask how it's going?
__Raj What? I thought we were all… never mind.
__Amy Well, I don't have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.
__Penny Well, good for you.
__Amy Thank you.
__Bernadette And how many guys have you gone out with?
__Stuart Please be less than two.
__Amy Three.
__Stuart Damn it.
__Leonard Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?
__Sheldon It scared me straight, Leonard.
__Barry Hey, I've been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.
__Leonard Thank you, Barry.
__Barry But you have to add my name to your paper.
__Sheldon That's preposterous.
__Barry I don't know, seems fair. You can't do it without me.
__Leonard Can you give us a minute?
__Barry Take your time. I'll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.
__Sheldon I don't like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.
__Leonard Me neither, but what other choice do we have?
__Sheldon How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
__Helium Man They should've used among, right?
__Sheldon Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.
__Helium Man All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?
__Sheldon Absolutely. But don't be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
__Helium Man I am open to change.
__Raj Hmm. I'm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.
__Penny In school?
__Raj Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.
__Penny Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
__Leonard You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.
__Sheldon Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It's about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
__Leonard Why is he writing to you?
__Sheldon Well, they're looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I'd be good for it.
__Raj Oh. Hey, high five.
__Sheldon Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?
__Penny Yes. Don't take your shirt off just because the director said so.
__Sheldon This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I'm sure if there's nudity, it will be tasteful.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.
__Bernadette Pause the game, Howard.
__Howard Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?
__Bernadette We need to talk about redecorating this place.
__Howard Oh, no, not this again.
__Bernadette Look, I get that you grew up here and you're attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.
__Howard Oh, honey, of course it's your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?
__Bernadette All right. Let's start over. I'm redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I'm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.
__Howard May I say something?
__Bernadette Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper 'cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
__Howard Never mind.
__Leonard I'm the one who thought of Spockumentary.
__Penny And I'm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Wil Wheaton Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.
__Adam Nice to meet you.
__Sheldon Oh, it's nice to meet you. I admire your father's work very much. It's not every day I get to meet someone whose life's journey began in my hero's scrotum.
__Wil I told you. This guy is gold.
__Howard Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.
__Howard I'm listening.
__Bernadette Let's just redo one room and see how it goes.
__Howard That is reasonable. But what room?
__Bernadette How 'bout this one?
__Howard No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.
__Bernadette Then how 'bout the bathroom?
__Howard I want to change my answer.
__Bernadette Fine. Then the dining room.
__Howard I guess we didn't use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn't happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
__Bernadette Great. I'm gonna go pick out paint samples.
__Sheldon All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
__Leonard How long have you known Adam?
__Wil A few years.
__Leonard And what are you getting him back for?
__Adam Let's start with your name and occupation.
__Sheldon Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.
__Adam And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?
__Sheldon The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine.
__Adam What was it about Spock that appealed to you?
__Sheldon I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I'm not. You're moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.
__Penny Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.
__Leonard My brother was mean to me, too.
__Penny Yeah, you probably had it coming.
__Sheldon I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That's her over there.
__Penny Hi. Look at that. I'm in a movie, my shirt stayed on.
__Adam Can we see the napkin?
__Sheldon Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.
__Leonard When did we get a wall safe?
__Sheldon When there was no more room in the floor safe.
__Leonard When did we get a floor safe?
__Sheldon When we got the security camera.
__Leonard There's a security camera?
__Sheldon Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.
__Penny Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.
__Sheldon Yeah. You don't have to tell me.
__Howard Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.
__Raj Oh, okay. Got it.
__Howard Hey. What's going on?
__Raj Hey.
__Bernadette Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.
__Raj You sure? It's a pretty great wall.
__Mr Rostenkowski What's so great about it?
__Raj I'm sorry. I did what I could.
__Bernadette Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?
__Howard Your dad's on your side.
__Bernadette He's not on my side. He's doing all the work for free.
__Raj That is so generous of you. I'd like to switch sides.
__Howard Look, uh, I don't even think you can take this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.
__Raj Well, it's easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.
__Howard When is your visa up?
__Wil Um, doesn't Adam count as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?
__Sheldon No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you're only 50%. Which isn't bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.
__Penny Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?
__Sheldon Wouldn't you like to know?
__Penny I would.
__Sheldon All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.
__Leonard You have a will?
__Sheldon Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.
__Leonard Will Wil want it?
__Wil Wil won't.
__Penny Oh, what's that ring box?
__Sheldon Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.
__Penny What?
__Leonard You bought her a ring?
__Sheldon No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother's finger and stole it.
__Wil Sheldon, that's awful.
__Sheldon No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.
__Penny Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?
__Sheldon No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
__Leonard Oh, man, I'm sorry, that must have been devastating for you.
__Sheldon No, not at all. No, I'm fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.
__Penny I know. It just…
__Sheldon I said I'm fine!  We've gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard's joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn't going to happen. But that's why I changed it to, what would Spock do?
__Adam Did you find that helpful?
__Sheldon Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.
__Penny I knew I could smell 'em.
__Adam What about from when you were a kid?
__Sheldon Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.
__Sheldon Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.
__Adam That must have been very upsetting for you.
__Sheldon Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I've spent a lifetime mastering.
__Penny Oh pfft.
__Sheldon Excuse me?
__Penny I'm sorry. I'm not here.
__Sheldon No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?
__Leonard You did go pfft.
__Penny All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I'm no expert, but aren't you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.
__Leonard Just like you.
__Sheldon Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.
__Penny Sweetie, you're yelling.
__Sheldon Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I've put this Amy nonsense behind me.
__Wil This documentary is gonna be awesome.
__Howard Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.
__Mr Rostenkowski Yeah, that's a rat skull.
__Howard Oh.
__Mr Rostenkowski Relax. There's enough droppings down here without you making more.
__Howard Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?
__Mr Rostenkowski Yeah. I think that's the den.
__Howard Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.
__Mr Rostenkowski Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don't want to hear this, but it wouldn't take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.
__Howard Why wouldn't I want to hear it?
__Mr Rostenkowski ‘Cause Bernie said you didn't want kids.
__Howard That's not true at all. I wish she'd get pregnant, believe me. I'm climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.
__Mr Rostenkowski Huh.
__Howard I don't know why she's lying to you. She's the one who doesn't want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…
__Bernadette Earthquake.
__Howard Oh, my God, we're gonna die.
__Bernadette Aftershock.
__Leonard I know. I also can't believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard Hey, buddy. How you doing?
__Sheldon Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon Do you think they're going to put my outburst in the documentary?
__Leonard Oh, yeah.
__Penny Definitely.
__Sheldon Well, there's no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha'kiv na'ish Du stau.
__Penny Do you know what that means?
__Leonard No.
__Penny Are you telling the truth?
__Leonard Nirsh.
__Sheldon Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn't accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.
__Penny What are you gonna do?
__Sheldon I'm going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.
__Howard That would be nice.
__Bernadette I told my dad that you were the one who didn't want kids because I didn't want to disappoint him.
__Howard But you were okay throwing me under the bus?
__Bernadette Turns out yeah, I didn't think twice about it.
__Mr Rostenkowski Bernie, you don't need to worry about me. But I don't want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.
__Bernadette Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?
__Mr Rostenkowski This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I'm gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.
__Raj It's interesting your father didn't help around the house and Howard doesn't help, either, so in a way, Howard's not only like your father, but he's also like the child that you're afraid to have.
__Howard Why are you still here?
__Raj Fine, I'll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.
__Howard All right, I admit that I don't help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.
__Bernadette Why?
__Howard Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I'd always be there.
__Bernadette Okay, I'll think about it.
__Bernadette It's an actual I'll think about it.
__Howard I really believe I'd be a great dad.
__Bernadette I know you would.
__Howard Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?
__Spock Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic.
__Sheldon Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?
__Leonard Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.
__Sheldon Those are very wise words.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon They'd just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
__Leonard Well, he's having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.
__Penny Aren't you worried you're making French toast on oatmeal day?
__Penny Oh, I don't want credit for that.
__Sheldon Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.
__Leonard You're in a good mood.
__Sheldon Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.
__Leonard What brought this on?
__Sheldon I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.
__Penny And you don't want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
__Sheldon No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.
__Leonard Hey, I made French toast sticks.
__Sheldon On oatmeal day?
__Leonard Ah, I also made oatmeal.
__Sheldon Ooh, that's a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You're married, it doesn't matter what you look like.
__Penny Don't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard No problem.
__Raj So what's up?
__Sheldon Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I'm looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.
__Howard You sure you're up for that? She did hurt you.
__Sheldon Oh, no, it's all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.
__Raj You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
__Howard Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You're crazy.
__Raj Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.
__Sheldon Gentlemen.
__Raj Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.
__Howard But what are you looking for?
__Sheldon All I'm looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o'clock tonight.
__Howard Isn't that a little unreasonable?
__Sheldon All right, fine, she doesn't need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.
__Amy Okay. But I'm really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
__Penny Uh, I don't think any of your comfort zones are showing.
__Bernadette Yeah, it's your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.
__Penny No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
__Penny Ooh.
__Bernadette Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.
__Penny Yeah, come on, tell us more.
__Amy Well, I told you his name and that he's tall. What more do you need?
__Bernadette Did you kiss him yet?
__Amy Just a little peck on the lips.
__Penny Well, we're your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we'll leave you alone.
__Amy Fine. Um, he's British. All right, that is a juicy one.
__Penny All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?
__Bernadette Tea and basketball?
__Amy To that new Italian place on Walnut.
__Bernadette Oh, nice.
__Amy I'm gonna go look for other shoes.
__Penny Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.
__Bernadette Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?
__Penny We don't even know what time they're gonna be there.
__Bernadette I'll just call the restaurant, pretend I'm Amy and check the reservation.
__Penny Damn, you're sneaky.
__Bernadette Yeah, but I'm little, so it's adorable.
__Sheldon Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.
__Howard If you don't want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?
__Sheldon Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.
__Howard You seriously think women would fight for you?
__Sheldon People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?
__Howard He's right, he knows a lot of jokes.
__Raj Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.
__Howard Well, he's smart, he's a respected scientist.
__Sheldon And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
__Raj I don't know if I'd say you… oh.
__Howard I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.
__Sheldon Oh, we'll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.
__Raj Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon's contact information.
__Howard Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.
__Raj I'm a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
__Howard Me, too. And we've seen the prize.
__Penny Oh, I forgot to tell you, we're gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.
__Leonard What? I don't want to do that.
__Penny What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?
__Leonard This is the movie that big soda doesn't want you to see.
__Penny No, it's the movie your wife doesn't want you to see.
__Leonard So you're actually okay with invading your friend's privacy?
__Penny You're not curious who she's out with?
__Leonard Not really.
__Penny But you're curious about aluminium cans? You're a weird little guy.
__Howard Congratulations.
__Raj This is exciting.
__Sheldon Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.
__Howard Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
__Sheldon And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.
__Raj I, I hope we didn't make the puzzles too hard.
__Howard Well, if she can solve them, it'll prove she's intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.
__Sheldon Golly, she sounds too good to be true.
__Amy Well, I'm having a good time, too. If you don't mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?
__Dave Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.
__Amy Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.
__Dave No, it's, it's fine. It's why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.
__ Hey. So, where are they?
__Bernadette Across the street, in the left window.
__Penny Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.
__Bernadette Right here.
__Leonard You just happen to have those in the car?
__Bernadette Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.
__Leonard By stalking them?
__Bernadette No. Stalkers are creepy. I'm just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.
__Penny Oh, there he is.
__Bernadette He's cute, right?
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard Can I see?
__Penny What, now you're interested? You didn't even want to come.
__Leonard I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.
__Penny Fine.
__Leonard Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they're having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they're saying.
__Bernadette Yeah, I should've brought my parabolic microphone.
__Penny Your what?
__Bernadette Nothing. Not important.
__Dave So you've never been married?
__Amy No. I mean, to be completely honest, I've, I've only been in one long-term relationship.
__Dave Oh. What happened with that?
__Amy That's a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.
__Dave Oh, that's too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?
__Amy No. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech.
__Dave I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What's his focus?
__Amy Um, used to be string theory, now it's dark matter. But let's not discuss Sheldon. Let's get back to you.
__Dave Wait, you're not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
__Amy I'm trying not to. Do you know him?
__Dave No, but I've followed his work for years. He's a rock star. You've got to tell me about him. What's he like?
__Penny He really seems into her.
__Bernadette I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.
__Leonard Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?
__Bernadette Why'd you bring him?
__Penny I had to; we're married now.
__Bernadette Ugh, I hear that.
__Dave I'm sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.
__Amy Sure, why not?
__Dave It's more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?
__Amy Um about an hour and half.
__Dave Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?
__Amy Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.
__Dave Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he's a genius, and I wasn't even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.
__Amy What was the rest of your question?
__Dave Do you think you could introduce me to him?
__Amy Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
__Dave You're right, it's, it's weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I'd be too nervous. Oh, I don't know what to do.
__Leonard Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.
__Bernadette Right here.
__Sheldon Someone will show.
__Howard And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.
__Raj Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
__Sheldon Someone will show.
__Sheldon Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can't shake a stick around here without hitting that.
__Amy I have a DVD of that lecture.
__Dave Really? Wasn't it great?
__Amy Not as a Valentine's present, no.
__Dave Well, the next time you watch it, I'm the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.
__Amy That's, um, terrific. Listen, I'm, I'm kind of tired. Can we call it a night?
__Dave Oh, gosh. Sorry, I've just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I'm such an idiot.
__Amy No, you're not.
__Dave Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won't mention.
__Amy Thank you.
__Dave That you said you might introduce me to, I'm free on Thursday.
__Bernadette Hey, hey, they're leaving.
__Penny What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they're coming right towards us.
__Bernadette We got to get out of here.
__Penny Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?
__Bernadette He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
__Penny Oh, no.
__Dave She just hit my car.
__Amy What are you guys doing here?
__Bernadette Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?
__Leonard What happened?
__Dave O-M-G. Aren't you Leonard Hofstadter?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Dave I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It's Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
__Amy No. Pinch me.
__Dave It's an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?
__Leonard I don't know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.
__Dave Amy, I'm never washing this hand again.
__Leonard You really should.
__Sheldon One minute is a long time.
__Howard I've been telling women that for 20 years.
__Sheldon 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.
__Raj Thirty seconds.
__Sheldon Uh-oh. What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?
__Howard What?
__Sheldon Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.
__Howard You thought she was great in X-Men.
__Sheldon Oh, fine, I won't shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.
__Raj Guys, fifteen seconds.
__Howard Maybe she's waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
__Raj Five, four, three, two, one. That's too bad.
__Howard Maybe we did make the test too difficult.
__Raj I don't think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it'll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams.
__Howard It's an actual girl, and she's really pretty.
__Raj Answer it.
__Sheldon All right. Can I help you?
__Girl Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Girl Hi. I'm Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I've never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.
__Sheldon Careful, it's addictive.
__Vanessa Chija”e'vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.
__Sheldon And just like that, you're a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.
__Vanessa Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don't need to tell you, there aren't a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.
__Sheldon I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.
__Raj How could you send her away?
__Sheldon She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn't coitus her with your genitals.
__Amy No problem. I'm really sorry about your car.
__Dave Oh, it's all right. If you're free next weekend, I'd love to take you out again.
__Amy Um, listen, you're a really nice guy, but I just, I don't think this is working out.
__Amy I'm, I'm really sorry.
__Amy There you go.
__Dave If I ever do meet him, we'll have that in common.
__Amy Sure. Heh.
__Dave And, he's kissed you and I've kissed you, so if you think about it…
__Amy Okay, get out.
__Howard No. How does it work?
__Raj You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?
__Siri The time is 6:37 p.m.
__Howard So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.
__Raj Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.
__Howard Oh. Cool.  Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.
__Raj I don't sound like that.
__Siri Here are some images of naked grandma butts.
__Sheldon Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I'm no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won't be going alone, I'll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?
__Leonard Well, we're having everyone over.
__Penny Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.
__Leonard Otherwise we'd love to.
__Penny But we can't.
__Leonard Yeah, poor us.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Bernadette And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.
__Sheldon Well, Howard, what about you?
__Howard Oh, I can't. I'm going to the soup kitchen, too.
__Bernadette You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
__Howard If you can't support me when I'm lying, why are we married?
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Well, I'm calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.
__Amy No one can go with you?
__Sheldon No. They'd rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn't want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you'd like.
__Amy Oh. Okay. Thank you.
__Sheldon And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey's dry and you need something juicy.
__Amy Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you'd be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.
__Sheldon You don't think that will be awkward?
__Amy Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it'll be fine.
__Sheldon Very well, then. I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning.
__Amy See you then.
__Sheldon Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.
__Amy Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?
__Sheldon And there goes my list.
__Bernadette The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.
__Howard Six hours? Oh, God, I don't want to complain for that long.
__Raj Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
__Howard I happen to be a giving and generous lover.
__Emily Are you and I close enough for me to say that's creepy?
__Bernadette We are, and I believe the word you're looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.
__Soup Kitchen Manager Uh, can I help you?
__Bernadette Hi. We'd like to volunteer.
__Soup Kitchen Manager Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back.
__Bernadette Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
__Howard Maybe I'm happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
__Emily Are you and I close enough for me to say…
__Bernadette That he's an ass? He beat you to it.
__Soup Kitchen Manager I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.
__Bernadette Oh, great. We'd love to help.
__Howard Wipe that smug smile off your face.
__Bernadette I can't.
__Leonard I know. I feel so grown up.
__Penny Sweetie, you are grown up.
__Leonard Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull 'em up?
__Penny Yep. What's the code?
__Leonard My birthday.
__Penny It's not working.
__Leonard It's just the four digits, month and day.
__Penny Nope.
__Leonard Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?
__Penny Uh.
__Leonard You don't know my birthday, do you?
__Penny Yes, I do.
__Leonard Well, what is it?
__Penny May.
__Leonard May what?
__Penny I'm not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.
__Leonard You don't know your own husband's birthday.
__Penny Well, you don't know everything about me.
__Leonard Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.
__Penny Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
__Amy Hi. Ready for the aquarium?
__Sheldon I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.
__Amy If that makes you more comfortable.
__Sheldon If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?
__Amy No. You?
__Sheldon No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?
__Amy I might go visit my aunt next week.
__Sheldon Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?
__Amy No, the one in Bakersfield.
__Sheldon Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?
__Howard So we don't even get to be up front where the action is?
__Bernadette What difference does it make?
__Howard I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.
__Raj You're in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!
__Howard It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.
__Amy Are we done discussing the weather?
__Sheldon I don't know if I'd call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let's see, what's next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.
__Amy Sheldon. We've known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.
__Sheldon All right. Well, what should we talk about?
__Amy I don't know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.
__Sheldon Very well. I know you've been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?
__Amy Man, I walked right into that one.
__Penny Fine. You think you know so much. Who's my favourite Spice Girl?
__Leonard Baby.
__Leonard Justin.
__Penny Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?
__Leonard Nice try. NSYNC forever.
__Penny Damn it.
__Leonard Face it, you can't stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don't like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine's Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…
__Penny Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?
__Leonard Because it's orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
__Penny Interesting. I never told you that.
__Leonard Sure you did.
__Penny No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.
__Leonard What? I didn't know you had a journal.
__Penny I also know your voice gets higher when you're lying.
__Leonard No, it doesn't.
__Emily You worked in a restaurant?
__Raj No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.
__Howard All right, I think I'm getting into a groove here. This isn't so bad.
__Emly Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.
__Howard We've only been doing this 20 minutes?
__Raj You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.
__Howard Just because you have that accent doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.
__Raj No, seriously. It's about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It's about, it's about simply being.
__Howard Huh. Okay, I'll try it.
__Soup Kitchen Manager I need three people out front.
__Bernadette I'll do it.
__Raj Me.
__Emily Right here!
__Howard No fair, I was meditating.
__Penny How can reading my journal be an accident?
__Leonard I didn't even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.
__Penny Well, when you realized what it was, why didn't you stop?
__Leonard You know me, I'm a big ol' bookworm.
__Penny All right. Let's just finish cooking.
__Leonard Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.
__Penny Okay, really, I'm fine.
__Leonard Okay. Well, then I'll read it to you. It's from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.
__Penny Oh, God. Stop. I don't want you to read something you think'll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.
__Leonard Fine. Mmm, Penny's beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”
__Penny Does it really say that?
__Leonard Why would I lie?
__Penny OMG. OMG. We're so close to the new Star Wars. I can't take it. Gah. Gah?
__Leonard Well, you didn't read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.
__Amy No. It's okay. If we're friends, we should be able to talk about anything.
__Sheldon All right.
__Amy So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.
__Sheldon Just a few.
__Amy Go ahead.
__Sheldon How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where'd you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I'm getting kind of hungry.
__Amy Let's see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven't slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there's a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
__Sheldon Is that regular or honey nut?
__Amy I mixed them.
__Sheldon You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?
__Amy Just one. Are you doing okay?
__Sheldon I am.
__Sheldon I believe you. I'd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.
__Howard Thanks. You got to be kidding me.
__Man Sorry?
__Howard Y, you're Elon Musk.
__Elon I am.
__Howard Wh, what are you doing here?
__Elon I'm washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.
__Howard Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I'm, I'm such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.
__Elon Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?
__Howard Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.
__Elon And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.
__Elon Well, you're here on Thanksgiving, so you're probably a good person.
__Howard Oh. I made my wife come down, too.
__Elon You think you might ever get back out to space?
__Howard Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She's basically a carry-on.
__Elon Well, we're not quite there yet, but we're always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.
__Howard Thank you.
__Elon Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?
__Howard A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.
__Sheldon They gave one to that baby. He wasn't even awake.
__Amy Well, it wouldn't be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.
__Sheldon Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?
__Amy Sure. What is it?
__Amy So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.
__Amy It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.
__Sheldon Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.
__Amy Let's just play.
__Sheldon I'll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.
__Amy Hmm. Well, I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.
__Sheldon Very well done.
__Amy Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.
__Sheldon Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real, so I can't do that, can I?
__Amy But you can pal around with a hagfish?
__Sheldon Hey, let's not pull at that thread. Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other. Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem I'm having with my current friends. Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.
__Amy Isn't that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.
__Sheldon I know. It makes its own gravy, it'll slide right down.
__Sheldon How can you miss a game you've never played before, silly?
__Amy I guess sometimes I'm silly.
__Leonard Be right there. Hi, lover.
__Penny What are you doing?
__Leonard I'm sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I'm gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.
__Penny I am not putting that on the Internet. I don't want people to see this. I don't want to see it.
__Leonard Don't want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard Huh? Some of this? And, since it's Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?
__Bernadette Happy Thanks… Yikes.
__Sheldon Me, too. It's comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.
__Penny Well, I've never been friends with any of my exes.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.  Oh. It's my friend Amy. Hello.
__Sheldon Did you have a nice time?
__Sheldon Well, I can't take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.
__Amy It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I'm ready to be your girlfriend again.
__Sheldon Oh. I thought we were just friends.
__Amy We are. But I was hoping, maybe…
__Sheldon Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.
__Amy Okay. I understand.
__Sheldon Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I'm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.
__Amy Okay. Sure.
__Sheldon What are you talking about?
__Leonard You were just humming.
__Sheldon Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.
__Leonard How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
__Sheldon Let's see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?
__Leonard Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?
__Sheldon Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.
__Leonard Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
__Sheldon I feel like I know what song that is, but I can't put my finger on it.  My country, 'tis of thee. No.
__Leonard It's just an earworm. It'll come to you.
__Sheldon Okay.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.
__Leonard Is this what we're doing the rest of the night?
__Sheldon I'm surprised you have to ask.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.
__Penny Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can't. Something's wrong with me.
__Penny I told you if we were patient, he'd figure it out for himself.
__Sheldon I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.
__Penny Public nudity?
__Leonard Eh, that just means going barefoot.
__Amy Hi, Dave. Uh, it's Amy.
__Dave Oh. How are you?
__Amy I'm fine. How are you?
__Dave Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.
__Amy Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.
__Dave So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
__Amy Well, I was wondering if you'd like to get dinner again sometime.
__Dave Yes, please.
__Amy Great.
__Dave Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.
__Amy How 'bout Saturday?
__Dave Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers' market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.
__Howard Really? Why?
__Raj They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
__Howard Mm, boy, that's one of those jobs that's boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where's the memo with what we do now?
__Raj Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…
__Howard Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?
__Raj It's not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.
__Howard That's not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you're just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.
__Raj But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.
__Howard All right. This thing's bigger than you and me, band's back together.
__Raj So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there's an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.
__Howard We did raise the roof that night.
__Raj Yeah, we totally did.
__Howard Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
__Sheldon No they make my earlobes sweat.
__Penny Hey, sweetie, why don't you take a break and do something else for a while?
__Sheldon There was a project I've been thinking about starting.
__Penny Okay, great. What is it?
__Sheldon I'll show you.  Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I'm going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn't listen. Oh, wait.  Everyody cut footloose. Nope.
__Sheldon This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it's safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.
__Amy Why not? He's actually a very nice guy.
__Bernadette But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.
__Amy That's nothing Sheldon hasn't done before. Dave's just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn't bring it up again.
__Bernadette Okay. So where's he taking you?
__Amy Oh, he's coming here. I'm actually making dinner.
__Bernadette Oh. That's a big step.
__Amy It is?
__Bernadette Yeah. You're inviting him into your home. It's intimate. It's where your underpants live.
__Amy You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.
__Bernadette You sure? You've never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that's six-foot-seven?
__Amy Why not?
__Bernadette ‘Cause it's like taking your driver's test in a bus.
__Howard What should we write?
__Raj How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.
__Howard Someday you're gonna make an amazing grandma.
__Raj Well what do you want to write?
__Howard Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin' our vibe. We'll keep rockin' if you keep rollin'.
__Raj Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I'd throw it at your head right now.
__Howard I'll keep rockin'. You don't do that.
__Howard So, who is this guy?
__Raj Let's see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.
__Howard Cool name.
__Raj Yeah. He's 24. He's a deejay. He brews his own beer. He's got awesome tattoos. Dude, he's got a hot girlfriend, too.
__Howard Damn. I don't know if he's our biggest fan or I'm his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.
__Raj He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I'm throwing my hypothetical bra at him.
__Leonard How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
__Penny Nobody knows. That's why he's number one. Can you please go talk to him?
__Leonard Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.
__Penny Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
__Leonard What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.
__Penny Fine.
__Leonard I love you.
__Penny Who cares?
__Sheldon What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That's mine. Why are you so strong?
__Penny Problem solved.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.
__Leonard Hey, can we please get back to work?
__Sheldon This is Leonard. He's your best friend in the world.
__Leonard All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.
__Sheldon Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon Oh, no, he's drinking it.
__Raj That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
__Bernadette Who's Trent?
__Howard Oh, he's our fan.
__Bernadette Fan of what?
__Howard Uh, did you forget? We're in a band.
__Bernadette You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
__Howard And at the children's hospital until they asked us to leave.
__Raj Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.
__Howard Really? You want to go down there and meet him?
__Bernadette Are you stalking him? That's creepy.
__Raj It's not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.
__Howard After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.
__Raj From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.
__Howard So if you think that's creepy, you married the wrong guy.
__Bernadette Maybe I should marry Trent.
__Raj Yeah, like she could get Trent.
__Amy Thank you.
__Dave Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.
__Amy When you were married, did your wife cook?
__Dave Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.
__Amy So, a little silver lining.
__Dave I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?
__Amy Uh, about five years. I'm actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don't need to be so close to, well, you know.
__Dave I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.
__Amy Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.
__Dave Had to or got to? Sorry.
__Amy My fault. I brought him up.
__Dave Yeah. Well, let's change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That's a cool train. Where did you get that?
__Leonard That's a trick question, right?
__Sheldon Well, I shouldn't be surprised. There's a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.
__Leonard Yup, she's right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there's an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.
__Sheldon Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
__Penny Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
__Sheldon The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  I remember the song. It's called Darlin' by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I'm not crazy. I don't have to take a pigeon as my bride.
__Leonard There goes our shot at him living on the roof.
__Howard No. Let him spot us.
__Raj I wonder if he's listening to our music right now.
__Howard Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He's playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.
__Raj And he's, all, like, aren't you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!
__Howard I can't watch.
__Raj It's okay. Oh, it's okay. He's done.
__Howard Why is he looking at it?
__Raj Eh, no, he's not going to eat it, is he?
__Howard Come on, Trent, you're better than th-ah.
__Raj Ooh!
__Howard Let's just go.
__Trent Hey, aren't you the guys?
__Howard Nope.
__Raj No, never heard of 'em!
__Leonard I don't know. It's pretty catchy.
__Penny Do you even like the Beach Boys?
__Sheldon They have beach right in the name. What do you think?
__Leonard Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?
__Sheldon Of course. I'm already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.
__Penny Why?
__Sheldon It's about Amy.
__Penny Okay, look, I know Amy's like an old lady, but she's not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.
__Sheldon It's about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn't love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”
__Penny She did soften your life, didn't she?
__Sheldon Yes. She's like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.
__Leonard Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?
__Penny Better. You're the lint trap of my love.
__Leonard Aw.
__Dave Oh, thanks. It's, uh, Avogadro's constant. It's useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.
__Amy No, I, I think it's neat. Oh.
__Dave Sorry. Sorry. No one's ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.
__Amy No, it, it's okay, and we are on a date. I'm, I'm just a little nervous.
__Dave Well, no need to be nervous with me. I'm just a harmless giant from a foreign land.
__Amy You know, I'm just being silly. I, I don't know what I'm waiting for.
__Sheldon Amy?  Amy?  Amy?
__Dave You're kidding. How's my hair?
__Amy Sheldon, this, this isn't a good time.
__Sheldon I don't care. Amy, there was a song I couldn't get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can't get you out of my heart. So, what I'm trying to say is, you're my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.
__Amy What?
__Dave If I may, I believe what he's saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don't mind me.
__Sheldon I'm, I'm sorry; I didn't realize you were on a date.
__Amy No, it, it, it's okay. Keep going?
__Sheldon Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.
__Amy I really want that, too.
__Sheldon Good. Because I love you.
__Amy I love you, too.
__Dave Kiss her, you brilliant fool.
__Sheldon Well, I'll let you get back to your date.
__Dave Okay, then. I'll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I'd, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.
__Sheldon What?
__Howard They're not supposed to be available yet.
__Leonard I don't know what to tell you, but they're on sale.
__Raj Wait. You're sure they're Star Wars tickets?
__Leonard No, it's Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.
__Sheldon The Web site's frozen. I can't get in.
__Leonard Yeah, me, too.
__Howard Same here!
__Raj Guys, they're gonna sell out.
__Howard What are we gonna do?!
__Sheldon All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You're good friends with my mom. I know I've spent my life denying that you exist.
__Howard Got 'em.
__Sheldon And I will continue to do so!
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Oh, thank you.
__Leonard I'm also really happy, but I can't pretend it's for you. New Star Wars in three days.
__Sheldon Hey, Thursday can't get here soon enough. I'm taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.
__Penny Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy's birthday.
__Sheldon And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn't need anything in that case, 'cause it's closed.
__Penny You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.
__Leonard I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.
__Sheldon But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy's birthday for me. Surprise, she's even older. Who saw that coming?
__Penny Aw, that's nice. Put that on her cake.
__Sheldon Arthur, what brings you back?
__Arthur Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn't a, a sex dream.
__Sheldon In the past, you've come to me when I'm struggling with a dilemma.
__Arthur And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What's, what's troubling you?
__Sheldon Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.
__Arthur Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?
__Sheldon Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.
__Arthur And they, they, they don't wear underwear.
__Sheldon So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?
__Arthur Uh, do, do you love this girl?
__Sheldon Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.
__Arthur Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.
__Sheldon By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?
__Arthur Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.
__Sheldon You're right.
__Arthur Great.
__Sheldon Where are you going?
__Arthur I don't know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.
__Sheldon I wanted to let you know I'll be spending your birthday with you.
__Amy Okay.
__Sheldon See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.
__Amy Obi-what?
__Sheldon I'll, I'll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.
__Amy Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?
__Sheldon It's late. Got to go. Bye.
__Leonard I know. It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard Hey. We're going to the comic book store. You want to come?
__Sheldon No, I can't. I need to make preparations for Amy's birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don't have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.
__Leonard You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.
__Sheldon This is my ticket to Star Wars….
__Bernadette What happens if I say, come in?
__Penny Well, find out.
__Bernadette Come in.
__Sheldon Bernadette.  Bernadette.  Bernadette.
__Penny Come in.
__Sheldon Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.
__Bernadette Just come in.
__Sheldon For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I'll stream it on Netflix.
__Penny We're sorry. What do you need?
__Sheldon Well, as you know, I'll be celebrating Amy's birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.
__Bernadette Sure.
__Sheldon Well, so far, I've come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.
__Penny Wow. You can really arrange that?
__Sheldon Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it's your birthday at Bennigan's, they make a fuss. I don't see why the Philharmonic would be any different.
__Bernadette How about something a little more realistic?
__Sheldon Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.
__Penny Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.
__Bernadette Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.
__Sheldon No, no, no, no. She'd be going alone. Well, if you think I'm afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.
__Penny Okay, well, what's the third option?
__Sheldon That I have coitus with her.
__Raj I don't know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?
__Howard It's like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.
__Leonard He's not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?
__Stuart My, uh, my doctor's worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?
__Leonard Well…
__Wil Wheaton Hey, you guys.
__Howard Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?
__Wil Absolutely.
__Stuart Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.
__Bernadette Wild thang.
__Sheldon Which do you think she'd prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there's only 8,000 tickets left.
__Penny Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.
__Bernadette Yeah, are you ready for this?
__Sheldon Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I'd like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.
__Penny Sheldon, that's so beautiful.
__Sheldon Then it's settled. Amy's birthday present will be my genitals.
__Penny Well, you're spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?
__Bernadette So where do you want to go?
__Amy I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.
__Penny Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.
__Amy Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?
__Penny Uh, I don't know. It was just a thought.
__Amy I think I'll just stick to Mexican.
__Bernadette Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.
__Amy Okay, what is going on?
__Penny Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.
__Amy What surprises?
__Bernadette We don't want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.
__Amy You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?
__Penny Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.
__Amy I, I can't believe it. I, I don't know what to say.
__Bernadette Well, we're really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…
__Amy I do know what to say. Let's get me waxed.
__Sheldon You're back.
__Arthur It, it doesn't seem like it's up to me.
__Sheldon I suppose you're here because I've decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I've never done that before.
__Arthur Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.
__Sheldon So, can you help me?
__Arthur Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers…
__Sheldon Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.
__Arthur Oh, good, good. ‘Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.
__Sheldon I think they say junk.
__Arthur What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?
__Sheldon This is an important night for us, and I'm worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.
__Arthur Sheldon, if, if you're with the right person, it, it'll be okay.
__Sheldon Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.
__Arthur Well, that's, that's very nice of you to say, but I think I'm just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.
__Sheldon Oh, sure. Well, you're fun to look at.
__Leonard Yeah, the wait is finally over.
__Penny I know. Then you'll finally stop talking about it.
__Howard Ready to go?
__Raj Let's do this.
__Penny Have fun, guys.
__Leonard We will.
__Raj I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.
__Howard I know.
__Leonard We're gonna have so much more fun than him.
__Bernadette No, they're not.
__Penny Knowing them, they will.
__Raj Oh, did you hear from Wil?
__Leonard Yeah, he's on his way. Time for bladder check.
__Raj Check.
__Leonard Check.
__Howard Check. Wait. Screw it. I'm holding it.
__Raj What is everyone booing at?
__Wil Hey, guys. What's up?
__Leonard Um, hey, Wil. What you doin'?
__Wil I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.
__Man Star Trek stinks!
__Wil Yeah? Live long and suck it.
__Amy Come in.
__Sheldon Oh.
__Amy Hi, Sheldon.
__Amy That's okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I'll, I'm gonna go put these in water.
__Sheldon Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.
__Amy Do you like it?
__Sheldon It's kind of spooky.
__Amy I can change it back.
__Sheldon No, no, no. It's your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.
__Amy So, what'd you have in mind for tonight?
__Amy Um, that sounds nice, but I'm not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.
__Sheldon Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.
__Amy You mean before you give it to me?
__Sheldon Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?
__Amy Of course.
__Sheldon Why are we saying give it to you like that?
__Amy Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.
__Sheldon I see. Is that all right? I'm sorry, but this is a litigious society. I'm gonna need verbal consent.
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.
__Wil Oh, I'm just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie's bad, it's gonna ruin their lives.
__Raj Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It's bad. Somebody kill me.
__Howard He's right.
__Leonard Yeah. No matter what happens, we're coming back tomorrow to watch it again.
__Bernadette Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he'd be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.
__Penny Well, I'm gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Amy So, um, should I get under the covers with you?
__Sheldon All right. Hello.
__Amy Hi.
__Sheldon Why are you shaking? Are you cold?
__Amy I'm just, um, really nervous.
__Sheldon Why?
__Amy Well, I've been waiting for this for so long, I've just built it up in my head. I don't know what to expect.
__Sheldon Neither do I. But we can find out together.
__Amy Okay.
__Howard I know. We've been waiting so long for this.
__Raj And we've built it up in our heads so much.
__Wil Guys, it's just a movie.
__Leonard That's true.
__Howard He's right.
__Wil Although, we all remember Jar Jar.
__Raj Leonard, I, I'm scared again.
__Sheldon Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.
__Amy Me, too.
__Sheldon I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
__Amy That works for me.
__Raj I don't think I can walk right now.
__Sheldon Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don't think I need any more advice.
__Arthur I, I was just curious. How, how'd it go?
__Sheldon Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.
__Arthur But, uh, what, what about Amy?
__Sheldon Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn't have the history with the franchise I do.
__Arthur Okay. Good, good talk.
__Amy It's not the best Best Western I've been to, but I'd say it's the third best Best Western I've been to.
__Sheldon I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn't the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.
__Amy What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?
__Sheldon Mm, that's a great question. I like when they're next to a Chipotle.
__Amy Okay, well, I should unpack.
__Amy I will. I wish you were here.
__Sheldon At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.
__Sheldon Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.
__Amy Good-bye, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy's at a conference this weekend, which means I'm available to be entertained, hmm. As today's youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?
__Howard Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.
__Sheldon That sounds awful. Raj?
__Raj Uh, I've got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You're more than welcome to join me.
__Sheldon That's the one to beat. Leonard?
__Sheldon Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.
__Raj Well, I should warn you, it's just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.
__Sheldon Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.
__Leonard Hey.
__Raj Hello.
__Howard Hi.
__Leonard How was your day?
__Penny Oh, not good. Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.
__Sheldon A doctor? Well, I hope you're not contagious. I've got a weekend in the telescope room I've been excited about for almost three minutes.
__Leonard Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?
__Penny Well, the doctor's a woman, but yes, because you never know.
__Howard What kind of doctor is she?
__Penny Um, a psychiatrist. Why?
__Howard Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you'll get to talk to her.
__Penny Yeah, they already know I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.
__Raj Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
__Penny That's interesting.
__Leonard I'm not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?
__Raj Low self-esteem.
__Howard Social anxiety.
__Sheldon Sexual insecurity.
__Leonard None of that is true.
__Penny Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.
__Leonard That's just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?
__Penny I don't know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she's heard about the drug.
__Leonard What if I get caught?
__Howard Fear of failure.
__Raj Lack of confidence.
__Sheldon Kind of a wuss.
__Leonard Fine, I'll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.
__Penny Thank you.
__Raj Pushover.
__Howard Spineless.
__Sheldon Still hasn't bought milk even though I told him two days ago.
__Bernadette It was. I just wish Stuart wasn't around so we didn't have to be so quiet.
__Howard I know. It's not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.
__Stuart You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?
__Howard What is it, Stuart?
__Stuart Can I come in?
__Howard Hang on. Should I send him away?
__Bernadette No, it's okay.
__Stuart Thanks, Bernie.
__Howard What's up?
__Stuart Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I'd make it easy on you guys and find my own place.
__Howard Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.
__Bernadette So, when are you thinking of moving?
__Stuart Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.
__Bernadette Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?
__Stuart Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it.
__Bernadette You're very welcome.
__Stuart Hmm.
__Howard What?
__Stuart Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you're awake.
__Raj Uh, making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.
__Sheldon Hmm. What are you doing now?
__Raj Still making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.
__Sheldon Oh, I see. How about now?
__Raj Now I'm making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
__Sheldon Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who'd been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.
__Raj Fine, you want something to do? There's about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don't you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.
__Sheldon Yep, I'm on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.
__Raj Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.
__Sheldon Found one.
__Raj No, you didn't. There are millions of data points there.
__Sheldon But, look, an optical transient.
__Raj Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?
__Sheldon It wasn't difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they're twin primes, they're pink and smell like gasoline?
__Raj No.
__Sheldon Oh. I guess I'm a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.
__Dr Gallo Ah, it's my pleasure. I'm curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?
__Dr Gallo No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.
__Leonard Well, then you know her better than I do.
__Dr Gallo Well, I'm not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.
__Leonard Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?
__Dr Gallo Well, I didn't want to say it.
__Leonard No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.
__Dr Gallo Sounds like you're holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.
__Leonard Oh, no, I, I've worked through a lot of that stuff, I'm better now.
__Dr Gallo Mm. Good for you.
__Leonard Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?
__Dr Gallo That's heartbreaking.
__Leonard Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.
__Bernadette Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.
__Stuart Boy, who would've thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I'd still be here two years later?
__Howard No one.
__Bernadette Nobody thought that.
__Stuart Well, that's it.
__Bernadette I guess so.
__Stuart This is weird.
__Howard Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.
__Bernadette Ignore him. He's just using humour to express how happy he is.
__Stuart It's okay. I know he loves me.
__Bernadette Sure he does. Well, let us know when you're all settled in.
__Stuart I will. And I really can't thank you guys enough.
__Bernadette Our pleasure.
__Stuart Bye.
__Bernadette Goodbye.
__Howard He's gone. Let's start in the garage.
__Sheldon Ooh, perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation.
__Sheldon Maybe it's a new planet.
__Raj Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.
__Sheldon Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I'll be happy.
__Raj Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…
__Sheldon Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.
__Raj A medium-sized asteroid.
__Sheldon That's it? How common. That's the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
__Raj I kind of like chicken fingers.
__Sheldon Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.
__Raj Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.
__Sheldon I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.
__Raj You dream different than me.
__Sheldon It is kind of cute.
__Raj Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.
__Sheldon We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn't do Uranus any favours.
__Penny Hey, how'd it go?
__Leonard Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I've always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see…
__Penny Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?
__Leonard Okay, now, what I'm hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I'd be more succinct.
__Penny You're only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.
__Leonard All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she'd be happy to meet you.
__Penny Really? Oh, you're the best husband ever.
__Leonard So you'll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?
__Penny I guess.
__Leonard Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.
__Howard No kidding. Oh, okay, I'm about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?
__Bernadette Howie, I don't want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?
__Howard Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.
__Bernadette Why can't it be a woman cave?
__Howard As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you're not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.
__Bernadette I'm being serious.
__Howard Well, what do you think we should do?
__Bernadette I don't know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.
__Howard Oh. He was so excited.
__Bernadette Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.
__Howard I'll give it to him next time I see him.
__Bernadette Have you heard from him since he left?
__Howard No. You'd think he would've called once he got settled in.
__Bernadette Hmm. Maybe he's busy.
__Howard Too busy to call? He wasn't too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?
__Bernadette No, that's not what this feeling is. Is it?
__Howard Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.
__Bernadette And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.
__Howard That was pretty cute.
__Bernadette Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!
__Raj How is that both our names?
__Sheldon Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.
__Raj Yeah, s-so it's, like, Kooper with a K?
__Sheldon Nah, you're right, that's dumb.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.
__Leonard Wow, that's amazing. I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.
__Sheldon Okay. Guess we're gonna talk about you now.
__Leonard Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.
__Raj I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.
__Sheldon Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.
__Raj Wait, what happened to us?
__Sheldon Now, this isn't about us, this is about what's best for the asteroid.
__Leonard Well, what are you thinking of naming it?
__Raj We haven't settled on anything yet.
__Sheldon All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.
__Leonard You know what'd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.
__Raj That is a great idea.
__Raj So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?
__Sheldon I like it. Yeah, we'll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.
__Raj That's just Amy.
__Sheldon Exactly. See how well we work together?
__ Scene Dr Gallo's office.
__ And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.
__Dr Gallo Got it.
__Penny Uh, do you have any questions?
__Dr Gallo Just one.
__Penny Mm-hmm?
__Dr Gallo When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?
__Penny I just meant a question about the drug.
__Dr Gallo Yeah, I know what you meant. Let's put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.
__Penny I don't wanna.
__Dr Gallo Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he's perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?
__Penny You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.
__Sheldon Good news. You're an asteroid.
__Amy Uh, please tell me what to say next.
__Sheldon Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.
__Amy Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That's so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?
__Sheldon Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.
__Sheldon Even the girls.
__Amy Okay, I think I know what to say now.
__Dr Gallo I went to college in the '70s. It was a hairier time. I'm gonna say yes.
__Penny You know, if anything, he's turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.
__Dr Gallo Hmm.
__Penny And not only am I Leonard's mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.
__Dr Gallo Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn't sure if he was real.
__Penny Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.
__Dr Gallo Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.
__Penny I do. You know, Leonard's right. Talking to you is really helping.
__Dr Gallo Oh, I'm glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.
__Penny Okay, if you think it'll help. Oh, just don't make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.
__Leonard Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.
__Girls Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!
__Bernadette Maybe he uses Kryptonite.
__Emily Well, Batman's got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.
__Penny No, no, no, no, no. I've seen that movie. It's called Iron Man.
__Leonard What is happening?
__Howard I don't know.
__Raj But it's beautiful.
__Penny And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
__Emily Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.
__Penny Ooh, we should watch that next girls' night.
__Bernadette We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.
__Penny Oh, I love me some Leo.
__Sheldon Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I'm feeling much better.
__Leonard Good for you.
__Sheldon My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.
__Howard Glad to hear it.
__Sheldon I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.
__Raj Yay.
__Sheldon Well, why isn't everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.
__Penny You really don't know why?
__Sheldon No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
__ Flashback
__ Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.
__Penny Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.
__Sheldon Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.
__ Flashback
__ I brought you a little care package from work. It's our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
__Sheldon I hope laughter is the best medicine, 'cause this care package is a joke.
__Howard Hey, she came all the way here…
__Bernadette You're gonna want to take these with food.
__ Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.
__Sheldon She's a dermatologist.
__Emily I went to medical school.
__Sheldon Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.
__ Flashback
__ All right, here you go.
__Sheldon Leonard, I'm dying.
__Leonard You're not dying. It's just the flu.
__Sheldon I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It's killing me.
__ Back to the present.
__ I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Amy Are you feeling any better?
__Sheldon Physically, yes, but I'm upset because everyone's mad at me for no good reason.
__Amy Why don't you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I'll explain to you why you're wrong.
__Sheldon You know how, when you're sick, you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people's feelings don't matter?
__Amy Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.
__Sheldon I had a hundred and one fever. If that's not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?
__Amy Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be unbearable. That's why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it's ended.
__Sheldon You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?
__Amy No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.
__Sheldon You know, I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.
__Amy Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I'm gonna go take pictures. Bye.
__Stuart Hey. Where's Sheldon? Still sick?
__Leonard No, he's fine. We just needed a little break.
__Stuart Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.
__Howard He was being a jerk to everyone. Don't take it personally.
__Stuart Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants, I couldn't if I wanted to.
__Raj I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
__Leonard I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.
__Howard You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.
__Raj Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn't end with us having coitus with him, I'm in.
__Howard We should all take a trip or something.
__Leonard Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.
__Howard Bernie would love that.
__Raj Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.
__Leonard That sounds really fun.
__Raj Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don't stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.
__Leonard No.
__Howard No.
__Leonard No.
__Howard No.
__Penny Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?
__Leonard Yes. And Howard's birthday was a drop-off party, you didn't have to stay.
__Penny Well, I'm in. When are we going?
__Leonard This weekend.
__Sheldon Oh, where are we going?
__Leonard Well, Vegas, but…
__Sheldon Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.
__Sheldon Well, now, well, that's hurtful.
__Penny Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.
__Sheldon I can consider a place America's urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
__Leonard Not this time.
__Sheldon Oh, fine. Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.
__Leonard He's coming, too.
__Sheldon Well, then Raj and I will…
__Leonard Nope.
__Sheldon Very well. Stuart.
__Leonard Oh, great. Do that.
__Sheldon Ugh. Stuart.
__Sheldon Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.
__Amy I said what's new, but sure.
__Sheldon Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?
__Amy Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
__Sheldon You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.
__Amy Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.
__Sheldon I can't believe you're not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
__Amy Who else's side could you have been on?
__Sheldon I don't know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
__Amy Sheldon, I understand that you're upset because you feel left out, but I don't know why we're even talking about this. Just apologize to them.
__Sheldon Fine, if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip.
__Amy Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It's called empathy. It's something you could work on.
__Sheldon I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.
__Amy Great. Now try it as if this isn't your first day as a person.
__Sheldon Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.
__Amy Glad I could help.
__Sheldon Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
__Amy I feel so, so bad.
__Sheldon Hey, we're both great at this.
__Leonard Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen, you spoil it in advance.
__Sheldon Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that's not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There's no excuse for that. And I'm truly sorry.
__Leonard Thank you. I appreciate that.
__Sheldon I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I'm not just saying it to be included on your trip.
__Leonard Appreciate that, too.
__Sheldon Terrific. Now all that's left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?
__Leonard You're still not coming.
__Sheldon What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don't play this game very often, but you're doing it wrong.
__Sheldon Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?
__Leonard Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it's okay, then yes, you can come.
__Sheldon Challenge accepted. Sounds like it's time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.
__Leonard Well, I hope it's as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.
__Sheldon My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?
__Howard Wow. I'm impressed.
__Sheldon No, no, no, wait. I'm not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee's I'm Sorry played on the pan flute.
__Howard Apology accepted.
__Bernadette Forgiven, forgiven.
__Sheldon All right, that's eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.
__Howard Sheldon Cooper apologized to me
__Bernadette And he made it all better.
__Penny Can this wait?
__Sheldon I'm afraid it can't. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.
__Penny Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.
__Sheldon Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?
__Penny Leonard.
__Stuart Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.
__Sheldon And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.
__Stuart What trip to Las Vegas?
__Sheldon The one everyone's taking this weekend on the party bus.
__Stuart Of course, I wasn't invited.
__Sheldon That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?
__Raj Of course I do.
__Sheldon And, Emily, I'm sorry for saying dermatologists aren't real doctors. And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.
__Emily Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?
__Sheldon Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…
__Raj Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.
__Emily Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.
__Raj Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.
__Emily Why are you defending him?
__Sheldon I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don't you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.
__Emily Well, I don't accept your apology.
__Raj What are you doing?
__Emily It's called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.
__Raj Fine, how about this? You're making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you'd stop.
__Emily Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.
__Raj No, come on, please don't leave.
__Sheldon Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not…
__Emily Don't worry, you're good.
__Sheldon I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don't know which one I like more.
__Sheldon No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.
__Leonard You think they'll still go on the trip?
__Sheldon All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth…
__Leonard They're not going on the trip.
__Penny No.
__Raj What is wrong with you?
__Sheldon Look at him, caring about what's wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.
__Raj You went to Emily's to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.
__All No.
__Penny Is she okay?
__Raj Yeah, I calmed her down, but she's not going to Vegas if he's going.
__Howard Wait, that's an option? I didn't know that was an option.
__Sheldon Well, that is fine, because I've decided that I won't be joining you. I've realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.
__Raj That's very mature of you.
__Sheldon Well, I've been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you'll come back with is personal growth.
__Penny And there's your next T-shirt.
__Bernadette You know what that means.
__Leonard That Raj'll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
__Raj You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.
__Penny Here's some champagne.
__Leonard Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…
__Sheldon Aha.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.
__Penny You couldn't give us just one weekend?
__Stuart I told him this was a bad idea.
__Penny If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.
__Sheldon Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.
__Raj Oh, God.
__Raj You know, Sheldon…
__Emily Shh, let him finish.
__Sheldon So, for all the times I've offended you and all the times that I'll offend you in the future, I'm sorry.
__Emily Thank you.
__Sheldon Good. Then I'll be leaving now.
__Emily Oh, it's okay, Sheldon. Come with us.
__Sheldon Oh, that's very kind of you. But I'm sure you'll all have a better time without me. Let's go, Stuart.
__Stuart But I want to stay.
__Sheldon Stuart, now.
__Emily You know, I know he's a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.
__Penny And now you see the problem.
__Leonard Come on, you pain in the ass.
__Sheldon That's me. Bye, Stuart.
__Stuart Wait. I'm a pain in the ass, too.
__Emily At the moment? No, not really.
__Penny Shake it, baby.
__Bernadette Ooh, work that thing.
__Leonard If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him, not breaking his thumb.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.
__Penny What is that?
__Sheldon Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls' foot powder.
__Penny Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.
__Leonard That someone has a name.
__Sheldon Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.
__Leonard Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.
__Penny I park fine.
__Sheldon Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!
__Leonard Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.
__Sheldon Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you'll ever meet. Unless you're a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
__Sheldon And that's not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I'll see where she is.
__Leonard Oh, that's nice. Most people her age don't embrace technology.
__Sheldon Oh, no, she doesn't even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.
__Leonard Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
__Sheldon Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.
__Leonard Still doesn't explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
__Sheldon Meemaw. I'm so happy to see you.
__Sheldon Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.
__Leonard Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.
__Meemaw Thank you.
__Sheldon No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It's not my fault she died when you were four.
__Meemaw Is that nice to say to your friend?
__Sheldon It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.
__Leonard Can you please live with us forever?
__Raj I'm sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?
__Howard I'm just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.
__Raj She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.
__Girl Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?
__Raj Yeah, that's true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.
__Girl Which is probably why that movie sucks.
__Howard Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.
__Raj I'm so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?
__Girl I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.
__Howard Oh, that's what I said an hour ago.
__Girl Wow. You've been talking about Frozen for an hour?
__Howard You should've seen us after The Good Dinosaur.
__Raj It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.
__Meemaw Very. It's nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.
__Sheldon You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'. There's Amy. I just know you're gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.
__Amy Hi. Nice to meet you.
__Meemaw Nice to meet you, too.
__Amy How was your trip?
__Meemaw Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.
__Amy That's great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot. You know, I don't even get to sit there.
__Sheldon Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.
__Amy Can I have a tissue?
__Meemaw Of course.
__Sheldon Isn't that the best? She's like Grandma Spider-Man.
__Meemaw He's been saying that since he was little. I still don't know what it means.
__Sheldon Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I'll get your room ready.
__Meemaw Oh, now don't you go looking through my suitcase for presents.
__Sheldon If I did, would I find any?
__Meemaw Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.
__Sheldon That's a risk I'm willing to take.
__Amy Well, this is so nice. He's so excited to have you here and…
__Meemaw Okay, now let's you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.
__Amy S, s, si, size me up?
__Meemaw Sheldon's mother may be okay with you, but I'm not so easy.
__Amy Well, I, I'm, I'm sure you'll like me once you get to know me.
__Meemaw Oh, you better hope so.
__Sheldon A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.
__Meemaw Oh, you're welcome, Moon Pie.
__Sheldon Amy, why don't you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.
__Girl Yeah, I hear it's pretty good.
__Raj It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.
__Girl I'll take your word for it.
__Howard You should. He's really looked.
__Raj I'm Raj, by the way. This is Howard.
__Howard Hi.
__Girl Claire.
__Raj Well, I've never seen you here before, Claire.
__Claire It's my first time. I'm looking for inspiration for this movie I'm writing.
__Howard You're a screenwriter?
__Claire Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.
__Raj Yeah, I get that. I'm a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.
__Claire You're really a scientist?
__Raj Well, astrophysicist.
__Claire That's perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It's animated sci-fi for kids.
__Raj Sure. I love animated movies.
__Howard He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.
__Raj Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
__Claire Here's my number. Give me a call, we'll get together.
__Raj Yeah, great.
__Claire See ya.
__Raj Yeah, bye.
__Howard What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.
__Raj So?
__Howard So, how do you think she'd feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?
__Raj I wouldn't say she's beautiful.
__Howard Really? You don't think she's attractive?
__Raj I do. I just wouldn't tell my girlfriend.
__Meemaw Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon's bringing me my whiskey.
__Sheldon Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.
__Meemaw Thank you, Moon Pie.
__Amy I'm curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?
__Meemaw ‘Cause he's so nummy-nummy.
__Leonard and Penny She could just eat him up.
__Sheldon And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.
__Meemaw It's interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don't.
__Amy Oh, well, you know, now, now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar.
__Sheldon How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.
__Amy Well, now I know.
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Meemaw So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.
__Penny Yes. I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.
__Meemaw Oh. It's so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.
__Amy I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.
__Meemaw That doesn't bode well.
__Amy Why not? You, you just said it's okay for her to work.
__Meemaw Well, Leonard doesn't need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard's work is more of a hobby.
__Leonard That's my best friend.
__Penny Yeah.
__Amy Look, I, I get that you're protective of your grandson, but he's an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.
__Meemaw I appreciate your honesty, dear.
__Amy Thank you.
__Meemaw And here's some more honesty. I don't like you very much.
__Amy Well, maybe I don't like you either.
__Sheldon Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee's.
__Amy I think I should leave.
__Sheldon But why? Other than you two fighting, we're having such a good time.
__Amy The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don't need this.
__Meemaw Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.
__Amy What ring?
__Leonard Maybe we should give them some privacy.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.
__Amy You have an engagement ring?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Amy Penny, did you know about this?
__Penny All right, let's go.
__Amy When did you get an engagement ring?
__Sheldon My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.
__Meemaw Well, thank goodness for that.
__Amy Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?
__Sheldon Oh, I don't think I could do that.
__Meemaw Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.
__Sheldon I'm gonna opt out of that one, too.
__Amy Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don't need your hand-me-downs.
__Sheldon All right, all right, look, l, let's all, let's remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you've only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?
__Meemaw You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.
__Amy Don't speak to him like he's a child.
__Sheldon Thank you. I'm gonna go next door and play with Leonard.
__Raj Just to help her with her screenplay.
__Bernadette Oh. Well, I guess that's not so bad.
__Howard You weren't there. He was really flirting.
__Raj Hey, it's not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.
__Bernadette I'm sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.
__Howard Really? So it's okay if I fl…
__Bernadette Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?
__Raj Uh, it's hard to say. I think we're good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?
__Howard No. Never.
__Bernadette Absolutely.
__Howard What?
__Bernadette Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.
__Howard Fine. I had reservations about you, too.
__Bernadette No, you didn't.
__Howard No, I didn't.
__Bernadette Well, it doesn't matter now, 'cause I love how things worked out.
__Howard Me, too. And I think you're even more beautiful than this rose.
__Leonard Did it?
__Penny Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.
__Sheldon Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.
__Penny Come in.
__Leonard Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?
__Sheldon No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
__Penny Uh-oh.
__Sheldon Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here's the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?
__Howard Okay, so far we've heard, made up my mind I'm dumping Emily.
__Bernadette Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
__Howard And made up my mind, I'll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.
__Raj I'm calling her. And the threesome didn't deserve the belly laugh it got.
__Bernadette You're right. It could totally happen.
__Claire Hello?
__Raj Hi. Hi. Yeah, it's Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.
__Claire Hey, what's up? Figure out what time you're free?
__Raj Actually, that's why I'm calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.
__Claire Okay. Good for you.
__Raj Well, no, no. I, I didn't want to mislead you after you asked me out.
__Claire I didn't ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.
__Raj Wait, are you saying that we didn't have a vibe?
__Claire Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.
__Claire Sure, we had a vibe.
__Raj I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What's my next move?
__Bernadette You still have a girlfriend.
__Raj Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.
__Claire Hang on. We're both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.
__Raj Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I've been planning our wedding.
__Claire Look, it's just coffee. I'll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.
__Raj Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.
__Claire Great. I'll text you.
__Raj Bye. All right. So, uh, we're meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody's happy. Easy peasy.
__Bernadette Are you gonna tell Emily?
__Raj Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.
__Howard When are you gonna tell Emily?
__Raj He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.
__Meemaw I know more than you think I do.
__Amy Really? You know what it's like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?
__Meemaw Young lady, if you think I don't know what it's like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you're wrong. ‘Cause that was my husband.
__Amy Really?
__Meemaw There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.
__Amy Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?
__Meemaw Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don't want to see that happen again.
__Penny Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
__Sheldon No, I wouldn't.
__Leonard Just get in here.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny Go ahead.
__Sheldon Meemaw, look, I'm sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.
__Amy Oh, Sheldon, thank you.
__Meemaw I did.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, that is exactly what I've been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.
__Leonard He never disappoints, does he?
__Amy I think what Sheldon means to say is we've both grown together. Isn't that right?
__Sheldon Well…
__Penny Say yes.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Meemaw Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.
__Amy So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?
__Meemaw I suppose.
__Sheldon I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.
__Claire This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn't too scary for children.
__ Fantasy seqeunce.
__ And that's how Mommy and Daddy met.
__Claire Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?
__Raj I will.
__Leonard Hey.
__Raj Hey.
__Howard Hello.
__Sheldon If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine's Day, Amy and I'll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You're welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric.
__Leonard Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.
__Howard Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.
__Sheldon Not a clue. Raj?
__Raj Spending Valentine's Day with Emily.
__Leonard You don't sound very excited about it.
__Raj Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I'm still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.
__Howard Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
__Raj You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?
__Howard You've been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don't you just do it already?
__Leonard Yeah, just get it over with.
__Raj Well, you say it like it's easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?
__Howard No.
__Leonard Not really.
__Sheldon You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?
__Penny Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?
__Leonard I stopped counting at four.
__Penny All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.
__Raj Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.
__Leonard She meant Emily.
__Penny No, I, I really didn't.
__Raj Yeah.
__Emily And you thought right before Valentine's Day was a good time to do it?
__Raj You're right, let's talk again in a few days.
__Claire Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.
__Raj But I just broke up with my girlfriend.
__Claire Right before Valentine's Day? What an ass.
__Leonard Well, you were right, tears.
__Sheldon I'm nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it's Valentine's Day.
__Amy People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they're around.
__Amy What do you mean?
__Sheldon Well, you've become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.
__Amy Oh. That is so sweet.
__Sheldon So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon' Cooper's Fun With Flags.
__Amy Catchy.
__Bernadette Don't make it too hot.
__Howard Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.
__Bernadette Look at that, you shaved it all.
__Howard You're welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?
__Bernadette Ew, really? Get it out.
__Bernadette Uh, wish we had a skimmer.
__Howard Uh, you turn off the jets, I'll get a strainer from the kitchen.
__Bernadette I don't know how to turn off the jets.
__Howard Good, I don't know where we keep the strainer.
__Penny An hour? What? That's crazy. We have a reservation.
__Leonard I know.
__Penny So what did you say?
__Leonard Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.
__Penny All right, well, can't you, like, slip him some money or something?
__Leonard Really? I've never done that before. Does it work?
__Penny Do people like money? Is that what you're asking?
__Leonard A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
__Penny Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that's basically national sex night?
__Leonard I'm sorry. You're pretty, I'm stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?
__Maitre d' Maitre d': I'm afraid so.
__Leonard Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?
__Maitre d' Maitre d': Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?
__Man I did.
__Leonard Oh, I took care of it.
__Sheldon Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…
__Amy And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
__Together Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun With Flags.
__Amy Consider tonight's episode a Valentine's Day gift for you, our viewers.
__Sheldon It's also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you're not getting anything else.
__Amy Since we're live, you'll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.
__Amy No, I just blink a lot, it's not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here's our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What's your question?
__Raj What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?
__Amy Rajesh?
__Raj Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?
__Amy I, I think it starts with good communication.
__Sheldon You know what, that's not a flag question. Next caller.
__Bernadette I'm gonna put this down your robe. It's not moving, but I think it's still alive.
__Howard Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?
__Bernadette No. No, and it's not a rat, it's a rabbit. We need to save it.
__Howard Well, how do we do that?
__Bernadette Um, I don't know, look it up on your phone. I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.
__Howard Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it's comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I'm gonna say check.
__Bernadette Anything else?
__Howard To make sure it's not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it's not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.
__Leonard What are you gonna say?
__Penny I don't know. I'm, I'm gonna flirt with him.
__Leonard I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.
__Penny I'm still sleeping with you tonight.
__Leonard See if you can get a table by the window.
__Penny Hi there. What's your name?
__Maitre d' Maitre d': Glen.
__Penny Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?
__Maitre d' Maitre d': Well, you know, Valentine's Day.
__Penny Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…
__Maitre d' Maitre d': With all due respect, ma'am, there's nothing I can do.
__Penny You don't have to call me ma'am.
__Maitre d' Maitre d': Okay.
__Penny I mean, we're basically the same age.
__Maitre d' Maitre d': Okay.
__Penny How old are you?
__Maitre d' Maitre d': I'm 21. How old are you?
__Penny Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let's get out of here.
__Leonard What? Why?
__Penny Because I'm young. Let's go.
__Raj You really think so?
__Sheldon Yeah, you know what's not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we're rooting for you.
__Amy Your friend is hurting.
__Raj No, Sheldon's right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.
__Sheldon I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.
__Amy Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.
__Barry Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.
__Raj Kripke? Is that you?
__Barry Yeah, I'm just sitting here all by myself wondering if I'w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.
__Sheldon Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.
__Barry Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?
__Sheldon I don't see why not.
__Howard You're gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
__Bernadette He's pretty cute.
__Howard He is. Should we name him?
__Bernadette Are you okay?
__Howard No, I'm not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.
__Bernadette Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?
__Howard Poor judgement, obviously.
__Bernadette He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.
__Howard How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
__Penny It is freaking amazing.
__Penny I was just hungry and cranky, and I've never been called ma'am before.
__Leonard Is that a big deal?
__Penny Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
__Leonard Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…
__Penny Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it's crazy. Where did all that time go?
__Leonard Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.
__Penny Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.
__Leonard No, they're not.
__Penny You're closer to 40 than you are 30.
__Leonard Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let's do something fun tonight.
__Penny Won't make us any younger.
__Leonard Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we'll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.
__Penny Okay, like what?
__Leonard I know. Food fight. I'll keep thinking.
__Sheldon Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.
__Raj But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn't you start dating someone right away?
__Barry Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?
__Amy Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
__Barry No, actuawwy, I'm stiw here.
__Amy Now?
__Barry Yup.
__Amy Now?
__Barry Yup.
__Amy Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
__Raj Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don't know if I can do that again.
__Sheldon Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.
__Amy I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…
__Amy …spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.
__Amy Hello, Kripke.
__Barry I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?
__Leonard Are you actually gonna dance?
__Leonard Of course.
__Penny Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?
__Leonard No, I don't need any fish nibbling my business.
__Penny Oh, there's a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.
__Leonard That sounds fun. When's it start?
__Penny Midnight.
__Leonard Midnight. Really? You know what? Let's do it.
__Penny Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.
__Leonard Oh, thank God.
__Penny Yes.
__Bernadette Oh, terrific.
__Howard It's not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what's under this robe, and you still married me.
__Bernadette If you're really worried, we'll take him to the vet and have him tested.
__Howard Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.
__Bernadette Oh, cut off his head? That's where his little nose is.
__Howard He's not showing any symptoms. I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
__Bernadette Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
__Howard No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
__Bernadette We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.
__Amy It really can.
__Sheldon All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven't spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.
__Raj I'm sorry for bothering you. I'll hang up now.
__Amy No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you're not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.
__Sheldon Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn't good for us.
__Barry Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.
__Amy I'm just gonna push all the buttons.
__Sheldon Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I'm grateful for having gone through it.
__Amy Really?
__Sheldon Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
__Amy So do I.
__Sheldon When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…
__Leonard and Penny Happy Valentine's Day!
__Leonard We are young and fun.
__Sheldon I stand corrected. Fun.
__Amy And a lovely Valentine's Day.
__Penny Cleaning up is not young and fun.
__Leonard It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
__Sheldon Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
__Sheldon I'm glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.
__Bernadette Morning.
__Howard We? What is this?
__Bernadette I don't know. Maybe it says something on the back.
__Howard Continued on milk. If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.
__Bernadette What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?
__Howard Are you serious?
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Howard Are you sure?
__Bernadette Pretty positive. That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says…
__Howard Oh, my God. This is incredible. We're gonna be parents? We're gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.
__Bernadette I know, it's crazy.
__Howard It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.
__Bernadette Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.
__Howard But how's this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage. We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.
__Bernadette I don't know, Howie.
__Howard Are we in a good school district? You're Catholic, I'm Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
__Bernadette Calm down, it's gonna be okay.
__Howard How's it gonna be okay? Look at me, I'm a mess. And that means this baby's gonna be half a mess. And that's even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Oh, I heard about that. Why didn't you discover it?
__Raj Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.
__Sheldon Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj Hey, bud.
__Leonard Ready to play when you are.
__Howard Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.
__Raj If it's thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Howard I'm, uh, uh, gonna be a father.
__Leonard What? Congratulations.
__Raj That's so amazing.
__Sheldon Oh, no.
__Leonard Why oh, no?
__Sheldon Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?
__Leonard Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.
__Sheldon Oh, dear lord, Penny's pregnant, too?
__Leonard You're the other baby.
__Sheldon Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
__Leonard Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
__Sheldon I guess we'll call this a draw.
__Penny Leonard says you're pregnant.
__Amy What?
__Penny Don't say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?
__Bernadette I'm pregnant.
__Penny Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
__Amy This is so exciting.
__Bernadette Yeah, it's all real exciting.
__Penny Are, are you not happy about this?
__Bernadette I am. Of-of course I am. I'm, I'm sure it's just the hormones. But it's weird, Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I'm gonna get fat.
__Penny No, no, come on. Come on, you're not gonna get fat. You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
__Bernadette Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.
__Penny Oh, that's all right. All I heard was skinny.
__Penny Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
__Bernadette You're probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
__Leonard Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.
__Howard And then there's this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?
__Sheldon Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything's going to change. Howard won't be able to come over as much.
__Raj Well, he could bring the baby here.
__Sheldon Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
__Howard Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
__Raj I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
__Howard A million dollars? God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That's it, I got to start earning more money right now.
__Raj I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
__Howard This isn't a joke.
__Raj I wasn't joking.
__Leonard It'll be fine. People have kids every day. You'll figure this out.
__Raj Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
__Howard You're right, it is, I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.
__Leonard Hey, you know what we should do?
__Sheldon All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?
__Leonard Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
__Bernadette Where?
__Bernadette Can't drink.
__Penny We can, but all right.
__Bernadette Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.
__Amy Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can't laugh either?
__Leonard And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
__All Cheers.
__Howard Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.
__Sheldon And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
__Howard If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
__Leonard There's no reason you can't.
__Howard That's easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
__Leonard That's just research. We're never gonna make any money from it.
__Sheldon Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy's secret don't tell mama juice.
__Leonard Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
__Sheldon Oh. I'll just take one last sip. Ah.
__Leonard How is that a new invention?
__Howard I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
__Raj It's true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
__Sheldon This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?
__Leonard The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff. You.
__Sheldon That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus. Where's the bathroom?
__Raj Uh, it's in the corner.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Hey, how you doin'?
__Raj I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
__Leonard Doesn't matter. He's headed for the kitchen anyway.
__Howard Maybe that's an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.
__Raj They have that. It's called Uber.
__Howard Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
__Leonard Yeah. Why?
__Howard Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
__Leonard Wow. I've never thought about that.
__Howard And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
__Raj Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.
__Leonard You may have actually just come up with something.
__Howard You think so?
__Leonard I really do.
__Sheldon You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There's people cooking in it.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
__Bernadette I kind of already do that for Howie.
__Penny And whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
__Bernadette Well, we didn't exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
__Penny Oh, tell us.
__Amy Yeah, tell us.
__Bernadette No, I'm embarrassed.
__Penny Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups. We've all done it.
__Amy Me, me, me too. I'm a grown-up and I've done it.
__Bernadette Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
__Amy Oh, that sounds juicy.
__Bernadette Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…
__Bernadette Kind of on Sheldon's bed.
__Amy What?
__Penny No.
__Bernadette I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let's go in here.
__Amy How could you do that?
__Bernadette I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.
__Amy I do know what that's like. I really do.
__Raj It's a good sign.
__Sheldon Oh, wait, I found something.
__Howard Damn. What is it?
__Sheldon This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
__Leonard Can you focus on what we're talking about?
__Sheldon All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
__Raj Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.
__Sheldon And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
__Leonard I'd enjoy that.
__Sheldon Nah, she's a good kid.
__Howard If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
__Raj Look at that. You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.
__Leonard I'm telling you, you got this.
__Howard Maybe you're right.
__Sheldon Of course he's right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.
__Howard Thank you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You're welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
__Penny No, we're a team. If you can't go in, we're not going in.
__Amy Then why are we drinking?
__Penny Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?  Oh. It's Leonard. He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
__Bernadette That sounds fun.
__Amy Oh, no. Sheldon's drunk texting me.
__Penny What's it say?
__Amy Would you like to sing karaoke with us.
__Bernadette How is that a drunk text?
__Amy He used a period instead of a question mark. He's so wasted.
__Leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
__Raj Just bust a move,
__Leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
__Leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
__Penny Hey, guys. Congratulations.
__Howard Thank you.
__Amy Hi. How are you doing?
__Sheldon Wonderful. I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.
__Howard I'm really glad you're here. Can we talk?
__Bernadette Sure.
__Penny So, you gonna get up there later?
__Sheldon A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.
__Howard I'm sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I'm done being scared.
__Bernadette It's okay to be nervous. I am, too.
__Howard Thank God, 'cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I'm also really excited. I mean it.
__Bernadette Me, too.
__Howard I love you. Mmm. And I'm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
__Amy We're just friends, what are you sayin'?
__Penny Say there's another and look right in my eyes.
__Amy My first love broke my heart for the first time.
__Together And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you'd always be mine.
__Leonard Ah, push it.
__Bernadette I appreciate this, but you really…
__Leonard Push it real good.
__Sheldon You're kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else's bedroom?
__Howard Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.
__Leonard Probably 'cause you got to see your man up there rockin' the mic.
__Penny Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
__Leonard Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.
__Penny Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
__Penny Babies? Well, I'm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?
__Leonard I think we'd make amazing parents.
__Sheldon Will you guys keep it down?
__Penny On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
__Leonard Way to narrow it down to everything.
__Sheldon What is it?
__Amy Well, your birthday's coming up, and you've never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.
__Sheldon Oh, I suppose that's a discussion we could have.
__Amy Okay, great, I mean, it doesn't have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where'd he go?
__Penny W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?
__Leonard Well, where's that information been this whole time?
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy Sheldon?
__Leonard I'll check his room.
__Sheldon Surprise.
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Sheldon Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.
__Amy I'm sorry I brought it up.
__Penny Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?
__Sheldon Please, look at this porcelain skin. I'm like a human sink.
__Amy But it's the one day a year that's just all about you.
__Leonard One day. Right.
__Amy Can you please just tell me why?
__Sheldon Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we'd have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn't like me.
__Amy I'm sorry.
__Sheldon Oh, that part wasn't so bad. I didn't like them, either. But then I'd inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister's friends.
__Penny Oh, poor thing.
__Sheldon When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.
__Amy You realize none of those things would happen now?
__Sheldon I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?
__Amy Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.
__Penny You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.
__Leonard And we live here, so we have no choice.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.
__Raj He's been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.
__Leonard Well, just don't get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.
__Howard That's funny. Let's do that.
__Leonard Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.
__Leonard Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn't you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?
__Stuart Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he'd get paid. And I wouldn't tell him.
__Leonard Can I get his contact info?
__Stuart Sure, uh, but just so you know, he's kind of a diva.
__Leonard He is?
__Stuart Oh, yeah. Won't take the bus. He won't pack his own lunch. Won't let you spend the night on his couch.
__Sheldon Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.
__Penny All right, what about music?
__Sheldon I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.
__Penny No music it is.
__Bernadette What kind of cake do you like?
__Sheldon Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there's writing on it, make sure it's not all caps. I don't need my dessert yelling at me.
__Leonard Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don't ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.
__Raj You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.
__Howard Don't say that to him.
__Raj What? He beat out George Clooney, and that's something. Like, I love me some Clooney.
__Leonard Don't say that to anyone.
__Stuart Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don't always feel like I'm part of the group.
__Penny Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?
__Barry Hewwo, I hope I'm not too earwy.
__Bernadette No, no, no. Come on in.
__Barry And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?
__Bernadette Doing great.
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Stuart Sounds like something a member of the group might know.
__Penny Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.
__Adam West Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale's overrated.
__Raj Thank you. That's why I say Keaton's number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.
__Adam Oh, if you're gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.
__Howard Really? You're ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I'm Batman.
__Adam I never had to say I'm Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar's bungalow.
__Leonard I'm sold, you're ahead of Bale.
__Adam There's another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.
__Leonard Sure.
__Raj Yeah, of course.
__Adam What's an Affleck?
__Sheldon But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?
__Amy Maybe later I'll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.
__Sheldon But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that's the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.
__Beverley Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.
__Leonard Oh. You had a party for your 60th?
__Beverley Oh, I wouldn't call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.
__Beverley And I never did thank you for that, dear.
__Sheldon I am. Oh. Wait.
__Amy Are you all right?
__Sheldon No, I just, I got a little light-headed.
__Amy Oh, do you need a minute?
__Sheldon No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.
__All Happy birthday!
__Leonard Speech! Speech!
__Sheldon Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.
__Leonard Batman finally came to your party.
__Adam Happy birthday, Sherman.
__Sheldon Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.
__Adam I still get paid, don't I?
__Amy Well, don't you think I'm the one who should go in?
__Leonard No offence, but I've known the guy a really long time.
__Amy Well, I've, you know, seen him without pants on.
__Leonard Again, no offence, but so have I.
__Amy Well, he's seen me without pants on.
__Leonard Again, no…
__Penny Okay, this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?
__Sheldon How do you know I'm not using the facilities?
__Penny Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I've clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what's going on?
__Sheldon I don't know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.
__Penny I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.
__Sheldon I know that you worked hard to put this together. I'm sorry I'm ruining it.
__Penny Oh, pl, you're not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.
__Sheldon I don't think I can go back out there.
__Penny That's fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.
__Sheldon Based on this pep talk, I'd say you're still doing it.
__Penny My point is, there was a time I never would've been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I'm happy to do it with you.
__Sheldon Well, everyone will think I'm weird.
__Penny Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you're weird, but they're all still here because they care about you so much.
__Barry Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard's mother.
__Leonard Hey.
__Leslie It's been a while.
__Leonard Leslie. I can't remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.
__Leonard Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.
__Leslie Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you'd be living with Sheldon forever.
__Leonard Yeah, well, don't be a stranger.
__Penny Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he's a little embarrassed, so let's all be extra nice, okay?
__Barry What are you wooking at me for? I'm a saint. But a sinner in the sack.
__Sheldon Hello, everyone. I, I'd like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn't put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.
__Amy If I may, I, I'd like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it's customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.
__ General cheers.
__ Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let's do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.
__Howard Sheldon, I don't think everyone…
__Sheldon Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.
__Howard Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we've known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.
__Sheldon Little generic. Keep thinking. We'll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.
__Wil Sheldon, I know that we've had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.
__ General cheers.
__ That's how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he's famous and you're not.
__Beverley Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can't wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.
__ General cheers.
__ Someone caw Animal Contwol. There's a cougar on the woose.
__Beverley Barry, stop.
__Leonard Seriously, Barry, stop.
__Raj And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
__Sheldon And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let's speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.
__Leslie Uh, in the past, I would've said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I'm not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it's just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.
__Leslie Happy birthday, dumbass.
__ General cheers.
__ Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I'm also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs…
__Bernadette I can't think of anything to say that hasn't already been said, so, here's to you, Sheldon.
__ General cheers.
__ Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.
__Howard What? You gotta be kidding me?
__Leonard Sheldon, we've been together so long, it's hard to remember a time you weren't in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You're more than just my roommate, you're my brother.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Leonard Happy birthday, buddy.
__ General cheers.
__ Thank you. That, that was wonderful.
__Penny Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn't get to speak.
__Stuart Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I've spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone…
__Amy Hey, everybody, listen up.
__Penny You nailed it.
__Amy We've got someone who couldn't be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
__Stephen Hawking Hello, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Professor Hawking.
__Stephen Happy birthday to you.
__Sheldon Thank you so much. I can't believe you're…
__Stephen Happy birthday to you.
__Sheldon Oh, you're singing. Well, I'm sorry.
__Stephen Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.
__Stephen I was crushing it, but all right.
__Penny Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.
__Sheldon You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they're just extremely irritating.
__Leonard Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.
__Stephen And a one, and a two…
__All Happy birthday to you,
__ Happy birthday to you,
__ Happy birthday, dear Sheldon,
__ Happy birthday to you.
__ General cheers.
__ So, who's taking me home?
__Sheldon I've never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, you're an engineer. End of joke, burn.
__Attorney Come on in, fellas.
__Howard See, he's not wearing a tie.
__Leonard Well, he's a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.
__Attorney So, I've reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we've got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.
__Sheldon That's great.
__Howard Excellent.
__Leonard So what happens next?
__Attorney Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.
__Leonard Yeah, we did our own search.
__Sheldon Get a load of this guy.
__Howard Can you imagine if we make money with this?
__Leonard If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.
__Howard That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.
__Attorney Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.
__Howard Seventy-five percent?
__Sheldon That's outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
__Attorney It's university policy.
__Sheldon I know when I'm beat.
__Leonard Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?
__Attorney Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?
__Attorney And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I'm afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you're not entitled to an ownership share.
__Howard Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?
__Attorney Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.
__Sheldon Well, that's not fair. We should all get plaques.
__Leonard Sorry, but we can't sign this.
__Howard Come on, let's go.
__Leonard Thank you for your time.
__Sheldon Couple of questions about the plaque.
__ Credits sequence.
__Bernadette A little. And it doesn't help that I've got this heightened sense of smell.
__Penny Is that a pregnancy thing?
__Bernadette Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.
__Penny But now you'll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.
__Raj Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don't know what to do.
__Penny Oh, sure. Let me see it.
__Amy See what?
__Raj I hadn't spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.
__Penny Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn't return it and thought you'd like to have it. Happy belated Valentine's Day, Emily.
__Bernadette That's nice.
__Penny Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?
__Raj I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?
__Amy Why wouldn't you open it?
__Raj Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it's a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.
__Bernadette You don't think she'd actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?
__Penny I know one way to find out. Sniff this.
__Amy She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.
__Penny Come on, just open it.
__Raj You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son's genitals in a box.
__Penny Well, never hurts to have a spare.
__Bernadette What is that?
__Raj Wow. It's an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
__Amy What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.
__Raj I know, she's so thoughtful.
__Penny See, she's trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would've gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.
__Raj You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.
__Amy You don't need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.
__Howard We can't. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.
__Sheldon Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.
__Leonard Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don't do it at all.
__Howard Either way, I get nothing.
__Leonard Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.
__Sheldon To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.
__Howard I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?
__Leonard Of course, we can split any profits three ways.
__Sheldon I'm fine with that.
__Howard Okay, great.
__Sheldon It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.
__Leonard Sure, we could write something up.
__Howard You can do it, Sheldon.
__Sheldon So stipulated.
__Leonard Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.
__Amy Ooh, let's find out.
__Raj It doesn't matter. It's the thought that counts.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, and beauty's on the inside, size doesn't matter, how much she spend?
__Raj Seriously, guys, I don't want to know.
__Amy Oh, my.
__Raj Oh, come on, you can't say oh my, and then not tell me.
__Amy These things go for five hundred dollars and up.
__Bernadette Damn. All I got for Valentine's Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.
__Penny Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she's not trying to get back together with you?
__Raj Maybe you're right.
__Bernadette Or she's telling the truth and just being nice.
__Raj Maybe you're right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate.  Oh, guys, it's Emily. What should I do?
__Penny Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don't make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.
__Raj Hello?
__Emily Hey, it's Emily. Is this a good time?
__Raj Yeah, yeah. Sure. What's up?
__Emily Was it okay I left that gift? I'm really hoping we can be friends.
__Raj Maybe, maybe.
__Emily Um, you think you'd want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?
__Raj I'm sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.
__Emily I just, I miss hanging out with you. It's not like I lost a friend, it's like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you'd want to come over?
__Raj I'm sorry, I don't think that's a good idea.
__Emily Okay. I'm just, I'm having a really hard time, but that's not your problem, that's mine. I, I won't bother you again, but please know that you'll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You're a good guy.
__Raj Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.
__Penny I know, but you did it. I'm so proud of you.
__Raj Well, anyway, I'll leave you to your girls' night.
__Amy Are you sure you don't want to stay here with us?
__Bernadette Well, if you change your mind, we'll be here.
__Raj Thank you.
__Penny Say hi to Emily for us.
__Raj Will do.
__Sheldon I'll say it looks good. It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.
__Leonard I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.
__Bernadette I'm a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?
__Howard Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.
__Bernadette What is it?
__Howard Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we're forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.
__Penny Sheldon, did you draft the contract?
__Sheldon You bet I did.
__Penny Ooh. You're gonna make out so hard tonight.
__Bernadette So, you're just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?
__Sheldon Excuse me. I've been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don't need one now.
__Bernadette I know, but…
__Howard Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.
__Bernadette Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.
__Amy Well, to be fair, Howard's idea was based on Sheldon's math.
__Leonard Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard's invention, Sheldon's math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned if she wasn't working on that hangnail right now.
__Penny What?
__Howard Honey, this is fine.
__Bernadette If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.
__Howard Can I talk to you in the hall?
__Bernadette Sure.
__Howard Excuse us.
__Sheldon Hey, Leonard.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon If she doesn't think that we should apply for this patent, she's being patently absurd.
__Leonard Good one.
__Sheldon Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.
__Howard What are you doing?
__Bernadette I just want to make sure you've thought this through.
__Howard What's to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.
__Bernadette Howie, you're about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.
__Howard All right, if you're gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don't know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it's sweet that you're worried about me, but I can take care of myself.
__Bernadette I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about me. I don't want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.
__Howard Here we go with the ironclad logic again.
__Bernadette You've tried to work with him before. It hasn't gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?
__Howard Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that's cheating.
__Claire Hey, Raj. It's Claire. How are you?
__Raj Hi. I'm good. Really good. Well, I don't know why I said really good. I'm just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.
__Claire Really?
__Raj I don't know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what's up?
__Claire Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn't work out.
__Raj Really? I'm sorry. I swear I know other words.
__Claire So if you were still interested.
__Raj Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I'm not even sure what the last one means, but it's another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?
__Claire Uh, I'm almost off work. What are you doing now?
__Raj Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she's having a tough time. But it's not like we're getting back together or anything.
__Claire Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn't have her best friend to talk to any more?
__Raj That's exactly what she said. How do you know that?
__Claire I'm a girl. It's, like, page one out of the playbook.
__Raj Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?
__Amy I hope everything's okay.
__Sheldon I wonder what they're talking about.
__Penny If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
__Howard Hey.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard You guys all right?
__Howard Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I'm a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.
__Sheldon Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.
__Howard Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It's, it's with how you treat me.
__Sheldon Well, I believe I'm treating you generously. That's why I've stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.
__Bernadette Are you saying that his contributions aren't as valuable as yours?
__Sheldon No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.
__Howard See? This is what happens every time we work together.
__Penny You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?
__Leonard What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don't know about?
__Penny No. What I'm saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can't make fun of Howard.
__Bernadette How would you enforce it?
__Sheldon Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.
__Amy And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
__Sheldon Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow's on my spot.
__Leonard Howard, what do you think?
__Howard I'm on board.
__Sheldon I'll add it right now. Oh, baby, it's addendum time.
__Raj Hey, Emily, listen, I've been thinking, and I'm not sure it's a good idea that I come over.
__Emily Oh. Okay. I understand.
__Raj No, no. Please don't cry.
__Emily Okay, I'll stop.
__Raj Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans…
__Claire Fine. Do what you want, but she's playing you.
__Raj I don't think so. She sounded pretty upset.
__Claire You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I'm having such a rough day.
__ fade
__ Emily, listen, I'm sorry, but I can't come by.
__Emily Why not?
__Raj I think we both know if I come over, we're gonna get back together and…
__Emily I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?
__Raj Call you right back.
__Penny Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.
__Amy You should see the Valentine's Day card he gave me.
__Howard Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.
__Leonard Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.
__Sheldon Do you still like cilantro?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon You're tying my hands here.
__Howard All right, let's sign this.
__Penny Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?
__Amy Sheldon, what did you do?
__Howard I should've known.
__Bernadette 25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that's so nice.
__Leonard That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.
__Howard That's very generous, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, I've always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.
__Sheldon And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon What? I didn't sign it yet.
__Claire All right, it's your life. But you know how this is gonna end.
__Raj As a matter of fact, I do. I'm gonna comfort her, because I'm a caring and decent friend who's happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.
__Sheldon Uh, can you repeat that? You're breaking up.
__Amy I didn't understand your e-mail.
__Sheldon Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.
__Amy Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?
__Sheldon So, is that a yes?
__Amy Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer? You know that one's out-of-date.
__Sheldon Oh, but I like this computer.
__Amy The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
__Amy The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
__Sheldon The sound is cutting out. I can't read that. The video is failing.
__Amy Get a new computer.
__Sheldon What?
__Amy Get a new computer.
__Sheldon What?  Hello?
__ Amy  Get a new computer.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.
__Leonard If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we'd be set.
__Penny Hey, guys.
__Leonard Hey. What are you doing here?
__Bernadette We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.
__Penny Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for 'em.
__Leonard Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.
__Penny So, how's it goin'?
__Leonard Good. Slow.
__Howard There's a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.
__Penny Is there anything we can do to help?
__Leonard You know what, this part isn't that technical. You actually could.
__Penny Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.
__Bernadette Can we really help?
__Howard While we finish soldering these boards, it'd be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.
__Leonard I'll show you how to do one.
__Penny Hey, wouldn't it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I'm the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn't think that's funny.
__Sheldon You're too late.
__Amy Sheldon, this is silly.
__Sheldon You got emotional when that lab monkey died.
__Amy That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
__Sheldon Great. Now I'm gonna have that song in my head all day.
__Amy Look, I'm, I'm sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.
__Sheldon How could you do that?
__Amy Do what?
__Sheldon Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven't I lost enough today?
__Amy Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.
__Sheldon Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn't realize you'd spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.
__Leonard Yeah, perfect.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don't be discouraged if you can't do it as fast as me and Howard.
__Howard I don't know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
__Leonard We had a full spool yesterday.
__Howard What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.
__Bernadette Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It's like a beer commercial.
__Leonard Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.
__Penny How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?
__Leonard Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…
__Penny Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.
__Howard You want to come with us?
__Bernadette I'm kind of getting into the groove here.
__Penny Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.
__Leonard Okay. We'll be back as soon as we can.
__Penny Okay, so what is solder?
__Amy Knock it off or I'll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.
__Sheldon You wouldn't.
__Amy Whatch me.
__Sheldon Fine. I'm sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I'm sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.
__Amy I thought you might like it.
__Sheldon Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I'm gonna count all those nostril hairs.
__Amy Or you could just look into my eyes.
__Sheldon But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.
__Amy Well, you know, as long as you're happy.
__Sheldon Oh. I am.
__Amy And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
__Sheldon Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.
__Amy Oh, but he said you can get store credit.
__Sheldon Well, no, I just, I, I don't want to recycle it. And I don't want store credit.
__Amy But why wouldn't…
__Amy Okay. How 'bout we change it to why you're being weird about this?
__Sheldon I'm not being weird. I, it's hard to explain.
__Amy Sheldon, just tell me.
__Sheldon It might be easier to show you.
__Amy Okay.
__Sheldon We'd have to take your car.
__Amy All right.
__Sheldon And I'm gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
__Amy Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?
__Howard Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
__Leonard I know. I'm lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she'll have a coin collection.
__Man Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?
__Leonard Oh. Sorry, we can't.
__Howard Well, hang on. What movie is it?
__Man Oh, I can't tell you. But it does star Will Smith.
__Howard Wait. I bet it's Suicide Squad. Let's check it out.
__Leonard What about the girls?
__Howard Penny just said they're having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?
__Leonard Okay, we'll take 'em. But, I swear, if it's Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.
__Bernadette It is crazy. It's also crazy that I've made fourteen of these and you've made three.
__Raj Hey. Where are the guys?
__Penny Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.
__Bernadette Since when do you work on weekends?
__Raj I'm an astrophysicist. The stars don't take a day off.
__Penny You were home alone and had no one to play with?
__Raj Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn't like me. You need any help?
__Bernadette Not with Lightning McQueen here.
__Penny I think we're good.
__Bernadette I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?
__Raj Yes.
__Sheldon Sorry, you're on a need-to-know basis.
__Amy I'm driving the car. I need to know.
__Sheldon Right.
__Sheldon No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.
__Howard It's not a problem.
__Leonard I mean without lying.
__Howard And now you've made it a problem.
__Leonard Come on. We're a couple of smart guys. I'm sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn't make us look bad.
__Penny Penny (at Howard's workshop, reading text): Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.
__Leonard They bought it.
__Howard But we're gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.
__Leonard Oh, you're good at this.
__Howard Well, I lie a lot.
__Man Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You're about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.
__Leonard Hey, you were right.
__Howard Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.
__Man Uh, we're gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.
__Leonard Who are you texting?
__Howard I know. I want to make him feel bad.
__Leonard Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I'm gonna spoil it. You're a good friend.
__Raj Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?
__Penny Why?
__Bernadette What's going on?
__Raj Leonard and Howard don't have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.
__Penny Un-freakin' believable.
__Bernadette Son of a bitch.
__Raj Oh. You know what? I'm gonna let them know that I'm here with you and that they're busted.
__Penny No. You know what? Don't. Don't. Let's let them think they're getting away with it.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Raj Interesting. I mean, it's not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.
__Sheldon Just wait.
__Amy How long have you had it?
__Sheldon Just wait.
__Amy Do you want me to hold that computer?
__Sheldon Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.
__Amy I'm sorry. What, what am I looking at?
__Sheldon It's basically everything I've ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.
__Amy All of it?
__Sheldon I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.
__Amy Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I'm gonna need a minute.
__Raj I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
__Raj No, ma'am.
__Bernadette Okay. Okay, how about this? They don't know you're here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we'll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we'll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.
__Penny Yeah, that's pretty good.
__Raj I love it, I'll be all like, busted, and they'll be like, what? And then we'll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn't make out with me, either.
__Amy You have sporting equipment?
__Amy Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?
__Sheldon I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.
__Amy So, why do you feel you need to save these things?
__Sheldon I'd like to say it's nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…
__Amy Okay. I get it. I get it.
__Sheldon It ends with dinosaurs. I'm sorry if you think less of me.
__Amy I don't.
__Amy Why?
__Sheldon Because I'm a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I've been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I've never even thrown a toothbrush away?
__Amy It's okay, Sheldon. You know, I've saved a lot of weird things, too.
__Sheldon Like what?
__Amy Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?
__Sheldon I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.
__Amy It's not a contest.
__Bernadette Go hide.
__Raj Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I'm gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Hey, what's this?
__Leonard Listen, we did a stupid thing.
__Howard We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.
__Leonard So, these are for you, and if you're not too mad, we'd love to take you guys to dinner.
__Bernadette Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.
__Penny Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.
__Raj Don't forgive them. Stay mad at them.
__Howard What is he doing in there?
__Raj Busting you.
__Bernadette It's okay. They apologized.
__Penny Yeah, it's fine.
__Raj Well this is kind of anti-climactic.
__Howard You know what wasn't anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.
__Raj No spoilers. No spoilers.
__Penny And he's back in the closet.
__Howard Ready for dinner?
__Penny Yeah.
__Bernadette Should we invite Raj?
__Raj Yes.
__Sheldon Only you.
__Amy Thank you for trusting me.
__Sheldon What good is having a girlfriend if you can't unload your psychological sewage on her?
__Amy That's me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I'm, I'm here for you.
__Sheldon Thank you. I wouldn't even know how to begin.
__Amy Baby steps, I guess.
__Sheldon I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.
__Amy Oh. Okay.
__Sheldon I will always have the dent to remember it by.
__Amy You did it. Do you feel okay?
__Sheldon Actually, yes. I do.
__Amy Well, I'm proud of you.
__Sheldon Thanks.
__Amy Well, I feel closer to you now.
__Sheldon Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it's still a couple of hours until my bedtime.
__Amy What did you have in mind?
__Amy I really had to go home for this?
__Sheldon Yes, but it's like you're right here in the room.
__Amy And yet, I'm not.
__Sheldon But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.
__Amy And yet, you can't.
__Sheldon I know.
__Leonard Whatcha doing?
__Sheldon I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.
__Sheldon Oh, it's car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.
__Penny That's not what the forest smells like.
__Sheldon Well, how would I know?
__Leonard Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
__Sheldon Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
__Leonard Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
__Sheldon Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.
__Penny Okay, if that's true, why aren't there more genius squirrels?
__Sheldon You may need this more than I do.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he's sitting on a log.
__Amy You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don't we rent a cabin?
__Sheldon Look, I'm sorry, when did you even get here? I…
__Penny You know, there's a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.
__Leonard Because he's hitting on you?
__Penny She.
__Leonard Oh, good.
__Penny But I could get her.
__Amy We could all go for the weekend. It'll be fun.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.
__Leonard You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.
__Penny Sure.
__Amy Come on, Sheldon, let's go with them.
__Sheldon I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.
__Penny I'll see if it's available.
__Amy You know, if that study's real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.
__Sheldon Are you trying to manipulate me?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon Well done, it worked, we're going.
__Amy Yay.
__Raj No, no, you're pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.
__Howard Hey, where you been?
__Bernadette Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.
__Howard Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?
__Bernadette Yes and yes.
__Howard I didn't know you needed help running errands today.
__Bernadette I didn't, but Raj volunteered.
__Howard Really?
__Bernadette Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he's really been making a fuss over me.
__Howard Oh. Well, I guess that's kind of sweet.
__Raj Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I'd love to hear what you think.
__Howard And it just got weird.
__Leonard Okay, one sec.
__Penny Uh, what, what you got goin' on here?
__Leonard I bought a baseball cap.
__Penny I can see that. What team did you get?
__Leonard Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.
__Penny Well, we'll be in the woods.
__Sheldon I'm ready to go.
__Leonard Anything you'd like to say to him?
__Penny Nice hat, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Thanks.
__Leonard Why are you so mean to me?
__Bernadette Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
__Howard Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I've ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?
__Bernadette I don't think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.
__Howard All right, if you say so. What's in the box?
__Bernadette Oh, it's an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby's heartbeat.
__Howard Oh. That's cool. Can we try it?
__Bernadette Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.
__Howard So he can be part of the experience?
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Howard I'm surprised he let us conceive without him.
__Bernadette It's a sore spot, don't bring it up.
__Leonard I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it's like Colonial Williamsburg.
__Sheldon Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now's the time.
__Amy Have you ever been off the grid before?
__Sheldon Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
__Leonard I was afraid he was gonna eat me.
__Bernadette Leave it alone. He means well.
__Howard So you don't think he needs to rein it in a little?
__Bernadette No, not really.
__Howard And you're not concerned he's acting like somehow this is his kid, too?
__Bernadette He's just trying to be supportive.
__Howard Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?
__Bernadette No.
__Raj Hello.
__Bernadette You saw him carrying that.
__Howard Astronauts saw him carrying that.
__Leonard So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
__Penny Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.
__Sheldon Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?
__Amy Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?
__Amy On the other hand, safety first.
__Penny This sucks.
__Leonard And there goes our hike.
__Sheldon Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.
__Penny You know, we could still go. A little rain isn't gonna kill us.
__Leonard Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?
__Penny No.
__Leonard You'll wish it would kill you.
__Amy So what do we do now?
__Leonard They have some board games.
__Sheldon Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.
__Penny Hey, let's light a fire.
__Amy Ooh, that sounds cozy.
__Leonard I don't think I've lit a real fire before.
__Sheldon Ah, it's basic thermodynamics. I'm sure we can figure that out.
__Leonard I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
__Sheldon That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
__Leonard Right. So all we need is to…
__Penny Got it.
__Leonard A scientist made that.
__Raj Please, my pleasure.
__Bernadette And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.
__Howard But we have to set some boundaries.
__Raj I don't understand.
__Howard Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I'll back off.
__Howard Thanks for understanding.
__Raj Of course. I'll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
__Howard You need some help?
__Raj No, I got it.
__Bernadette Raj, Raj, wait.
__Raj Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.
__Sheldon Oh, well now, we'll never win. You always play the drinking game.
__Penny Not the drinking game, a drinking game.
__Leonard To be fair, good at both.
__Amy What's the game?
__Penny All right, it's called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they've never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.
__Leonard I've never played that before.
__Sheldon Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?
__Penny Okay. Calm down. I'll go first. All right, let's see. Never have I ever…
__Amy She's trying to think of something she's never done before. This could take a while.
__Penny Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let's just circle back.
__Leonard Okay, I'll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
__Sheldon So I drink.
__Sheldon Got it.
__Amy I can't believe you've been arrested.
__Sheldon I can't believe Penny hasn't.
__Penny Sheldon, what did you do?
__Sheldon Well, I'm not proud of it, but I jaywalked.
__Leonard Oh, no, it's like a horror movie. We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac.
__Amy I'm surprised you would do that.
__Sheldon No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn't, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.
__Penny What, he arrested you for that?
__Sheldon No, he didn't do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren't you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.
__Penny And then you got arrested.
__Sheldon Oh, and how.
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Howard But on the other hand, I didn't kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Howard Is it baby hormones or actually sad?
__Bernadette I can't tell anymore.
__Bernadette And bring back the bear.
__Penny How?
__Leonard Well, never have I ever used Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink.
__Penny Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.
__Leonard Never should've told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.
__Amy Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend's world in bed.
__Sheldon Amy.
__Amy You know the rules. Drink.
__Penny Yeah, go ahead.
__Leonard That's right.
__Sheldon All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can't handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.
__Penny I can't believe this. You realize I make more money than you?
__Leonard I don't, I know, but this isn't a big deal. It's just a little savings I put aside.
__Penny We're married. We're supposed to share everything.
__Leonard What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?
__Sheldon I'm calling it. I won.
__Howard No, Raj, you've been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.
__Bernadette I hear that.
__Raj Well, if that's the case, is there anything I can do to help?
__Howard Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby's heartbeat.
__Raj Really? It's okay if I listen with you?
__Bernadette Of course.
__Raj Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
__Howard Hey, look at that. It's weird again.
__Penny How long have you had this secret account?
__Leonard A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.
__Penny Well, how much you got in there?
__Leonard Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana's birthday check gets here.
__Penny My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?
__Leonard No, I do, and that's why I hid it.
__Penny What good is it if you don't use it?
__Leonard Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We're kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kept it a secret.
__Penny Well, I have a secret I've been keeping from you, too.
__Leonard Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.
__Penny I hate my job.
__Leonard Really? Why?
__Leonard Why didn't you tell me?
__Penny Because I know how important it is to you that I'm having some success.
__Leonard That's not true.
__Penny Okay, really? So you'd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?
__Leonard If that's what you want to do, yes.
__Penny Well, it's not what I want to do.
__Leonard Oh, yes.
__Leonard Well, that is the grown-up thing.
__Penny I guess.
__Leonard I love you.
__Penny I love you, too.
__Leonard You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.
__Penny Well, guess I gotta drink.
__Bernadette I'm not hearing anything.
__Howard Well, give me a second.
__Raj Are you sure you can do this?
__Howard Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?
__Raj I buried it there, so we could go home.
__Bernadette Wait, that's it.
__Raj Wow.
__Bernadette Isn't that the best?
__Raj You guys made a person.
__Howard We did.
__Raj And I like to think I helped.
__Howard You didn't.
__Amy Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
__Sheldon Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.
__Amy Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
__Sheldon Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.
__Amy Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
__Sheldon Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
__Amy Well, we all have a past.
__Leonard No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.
__Raj But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
__Howard But Batman is a man. You're talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That's just Man-Man.
__Sheldon Well, isn't Man-Man just Man?
__Leonard But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
__Raj Well, that's just Batman.
__Leonard No, if a man dresses as a bat, that's Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that's Batman-Man.
__Howard So does that answer your question?
__Sheldon Oh, I haven't asked it yet.
__Raj Oh, that's Claire. Got to run.
__Leonard I thought you were back with Emily.
__Raj Uh, actually I'm seeing both of them.
__Leonard You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
__Raj No, I'm actually dating two women. Later.
__Leonard Really? The guy who for years couldn't even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?
__Howard I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.
__Leonard Seriously, that guy's dating two women?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard People are coming over, it looked fun.
__Sheldon Well, we're only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it's a party.
__Leonard Your attendance implies it's not.
__Sheldon I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn't like a party. Oh, by the way, don't forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.
__Leonard Oh, Sheldon, we don't need a meeting every three months.
__Sheldon Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it's tomorrow.
__Leonard Oh, you know what? I'm not going.
__Sheldon Well, you have to go. It's Penny's first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.
__Leonard You're the only one who eats them.
__Sheldon And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it's pretty cool, isn't it?
__Leonard I'm not going, you can't make me.
__Sheldon Well, we'll just see about that.
__Penny What is the problem?
__Sheldon He says he's not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
__Penny Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?
__Leonard You have fun. I will not be attending.
__Sheldon Oh, fine. We don't have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don't want to.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.
__Leonard You're being ridiculous.
__Sheldon There's a motion on the floor, I'm ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.
__Leonard Can you please talk to him?
__Penny Well, why are you fighting him on this?
__Leonard Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don't need a stupid meeting. We don't even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.
__Penny Well, I will still come to your meeting.
__Sheldon Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow's picture day.
__Leonard Why are you taking his side?
__Penny Because it's important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.
__Sheldon You keep talking like that, you're gonna make colour guard.
__Howard I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.
__Raj No, it's just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it's exhausting.
__Howard You're exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.
__Raj But, dude, you're so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.
__Howard I guess I am lucky.
__Raj You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can't even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I'm like, am I at Claire's or am I at Emily's? Is there a third girl I've forgotten about? Like, where am I?
__Bernadette Hey, Raj.
__Raj Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?
__Bernadette Good. A little tired.
__Raj I feel you. I've been dating multiple women.
__Howard You sure you don't want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?
__Bernadette You guys have fun. I'm just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
__Raj Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can't even remember what that's like.
__Penny Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.
__Sheldon Oh, I don't know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.
__Penny Uh-oh, somebody's still pouting.
__Leonard Leave me alone.
__Penny If it's because you lost a stick, I know where it went.
__Leonard Not funny.
__Penny You know you're gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?
__Leonard Oh, of course, because I'm the only adult around here.
__Penny Really? The only adult?
__Leonard Yeah, that's right.
__Sheldon Tonight I'll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.
__Penny All right, you would think the only adult wouldn't let something silly ruin our entire night.
__Leonard And I'd think you'd understand why I'm annoyed.
__Sheldon All this could be avoided if you'd just come to the meeting.
__Leonard I don't want to.
__Sheldon Oh, it's just a meeting. One simple meeting.
__Leonard Stop saying meeting.
__Sheldon Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.
__Amy I brought my famous spinach dip.
__Sheldon Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.
__Raj Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire's fridge that night. I'm such a dog.
__Howard There you go again.
__Raj I'm sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?
__Howard Actually, what you're doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.
__Raj How could you say that?
__Howard Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.
__Raj I never said that.
__Raj Okay, that I said. But that's a real problem. You give a girl another woman's bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.
__Penny Oh, he's all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.
__Sheldon Apparently, perfect attendance isn't cool any more.
__Penny Don't worry, he'll come around.
__Amy Well, I get why he's annoyed.
__Sheldon Well, then you don't understand what's happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.
__Sheldon I love Lisa Simpson.
__Sheldon Wait. You were pretending?
__Amy Sorry.
__Sheldon No. I don't believe you. I could tell.
__Amy Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.
__Sheldon Hmm, what do you think?
__Penny You don't know?
__Howard No, I'm fine.
__Raj Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.
__Howard Just drop it.
__Raj Okay, I think I see what's happening here. You're jealous of me.
__Howard Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?
__Raj It's not what I have, it's how many people I'm having it with.
__Penny Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch Game of Thrones over here.
__Sheldon Gladly.
__Leonard Oh, good, go. You know, it'll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don't get too fond of this character.
__Sheldon It's not always because they die. In one case, it's because they've become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won't say who it is. It's Brann.
__Howard Wait, what is going on?
__Penny Leonard's being a jerk, so we're gonna watch over here.
__Amy Do you guys want to watch with us?
__Howard As long as I don't have to watch with him.
__Raj Fine, I don't want to watch with you either. I'll go over here.
__Howard Why do you get to pick?
__Raj Okay, then you go there.
__Howard Don't tell me where to go.
__Leonard Howard, just come in here.
__Penny Yeah, come on, Raj.
__Raj Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?
__Howard And I'm gonna eat it all.
__Leonard Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon's nonsense.
__Howard Tell me about it. I've had it with Raj, too.
__Amy You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.
__Howard Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj's actual period.
__Leonard If Sheldon's testosterone dipped, he'd become a butterfly.  Oh. Maybe someone's here to apologize.
__Stuart Hey, Leonard.
__Leonard Stuart.
__Stuart Uh, is this not a dress-up party?
__Leonard No.
__Stuart Was it ever a dress-up party?
__Leonard No.
__Stuart Howard, didn't you tell me it was a dress-up party?
__Howard Yeah.
__Penny May I take your cloak?
__Stuart Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.
__Sheldon Well, I'll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard's angry at me and Penny, I'm angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I'm angry at George R.R. Martin 'cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.
__Stuart So what happened with you and Howard?
__Raj Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.
__Stuart I'm jealous. Closest I've come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.
__Howard Yeah. Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.
__Leonard Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.
__Amy Oh, I honestly couldn't care less.
__Leonard Sorry?
__Amy Well, I just took your side 'cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.
__Leonard Well, they argue all the time. They aren't that close.
__Amy Who's always comforting him when he's upset?
__Leonard Penny, but…
__Amy Who's the only one who can make him take his medicine when he's sick?
__Leonard I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.
__Amy Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
__Leonard Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?
__Howard I don't know. I like the pain of others.
__Leonard Oh, well, then you'll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.
__Howard No, she doesn't.
__Leonard She defends him all the time.
__Howard She does not.
__Howard Well, she did. And human resources.
__Leonard Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?
__Howard Son of a bitch.
__Leonard You're, you're right, it feels good.
__Stuart Two women, huh?
__Sheldon Oh, perhaps it's Amy coming to her senses.
__Penny What's up?
__Leonard You know, you don't need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.
__Penny Where'd you get that from?
__Leonard From Amy.
__Amy Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.
__Penny I don't always defend Sheldon.
__Leonard Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.
__Penny What about your weird relationship with him?
__Leonard That's different. I'm like the little girl in Poltergeist and he's the creepy thing in the TV.
__Howard Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?
__Leonard I don't think so. Why?
__Howard Well just a feeling.
__Sheldon Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon I didn't say fun fact. I'm not a monster.
__Bernadette He's gonna be okay.
__Sheldon Now it's a fun fact.
__Stuart Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.
__Bernadette Why are you dressed like that?
__Stuart Oh, uh, Howard thought it'd be funny to tell me it was a costume party.
__Bernadette That wasn't nice.
__Stuart No, but he almost died, so we're cool.
__Raj You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.
__Amy How?
__Raj Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.
__Penny Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.
__Raj Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King's Guard to do her bidding.
__Sheldon Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.
__Raj Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart's dressed like a brother of the Night's Watch, and they don't have sex.
__Penny There you go.
__Leonard That's true.
__Sheldon Fair enough.
__Howard Hey.
__Leonard Hey.
__Bernadette You all right?
__Howard I'm fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.
__Leonard Let's get out of here.
__Amy That was scary.
__Sheldon Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.
__Stuart How come your head has your face on it?
__Sheldon They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You're thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.
__Stuart Don't you guys have anything better to do?
__Leonard Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl's bike? Nope.
__Stuart That's it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid… aaargh!
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I never got to ask my question about Batman.
__Leonard What is it?
__Sheldon If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?
__Penny Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
__Leonard That sounds fun.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Howard ‘Cause we're not in it for the stuff. We're in it for the groupies.
__Sheldon Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.
__Amy But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.
__Sheldon I also say don't contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don't remember.
__Penny All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.
__Raj I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.
__Leonard I'm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
__Amy Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.
__Sheldon Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.
__Amy Well, I'm going. You couldn't stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you're not stopping me now.
__Sheldon I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
__Amy And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
__Amy And now you know why I needed the massage.
__Howard Well, we're out. Bernie can't drink 'cause she's pregnant. And she's pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.
__Bernadette It's okay, you should go.
__Howard You sure?
__Bernadette Of course.
__Penny Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.
__Sheldon Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it's you and me.
__Bernadette Me? How? Why?
__Sheldon Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you're an expectant mother, you can't drink alcohol. I don't like to. You can't have sushi. I don't like to. You can't go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.
__Bernadette Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.
__Leonard The difference is she's bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.
__Bernadette I guess we could give it a try.
__Sheldon Well, little lady, you've heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Sure. I'd like to meet her.
__Raj Oh, that's great. I've been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.
__Sheldon Oh, but I won't be there.
__Raj Funny how that worked out.
__Leonard Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore?
__Raj No, I'm still dating her.
__Leonard Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?
__Raj They know that we're not exclusive, and we just don't ask too many questions.
__Leonard Who's Frank and Alicia?
__Sheldon You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?
__Howard Okay. Everything's hooked up. We're ready.
__Sheldon I am going to record this for posterity.
__Leonard All right, here goes nothing.
__Sheldon Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?
__Leonard Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.
__Sheldon Eh, maybe it's your voice. I'm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.
__Raj It's, it's beautiful.
__Howard Actually, it's making me dizzy.
__Leonard Good, it's not just me.
__Claire Hey, what's up?
__Raj Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you're free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.
__Claire Sure, I guess. If you don't think meeting your friends is too big a step.
__Raj Why would it be too big a step?
__Claire I don't know. I just don't want things to get weird.
__Raj Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn't weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.
__Claire Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don't like me? What if they like me and I don't like them?
__Raj Boy, it wasn't this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.
__Leonard Hang on.
__Penny What are you doing?
__Leonard Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.
__Penny You actually smell the wine?
__Leonard I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
__Penny Are your sinuses acting up?
__Leonard Since my preschool got a bunny.
__Penny Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?
__Sheldon Yes. And we're going to prove that we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
__Penny Oh, good for you.
__Sheldon Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.
__Penny No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.
__Sheldon Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.
__Leonard Okay, have fun.
__Leonard We're leaving now!
__Sheldon Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.
__Penny Okay, we're leaving, love you, bye.
__Sheldon Boy, do I love restrictions.
__Amy Oh, we're the first ones here.
__Howard Oh. Cool.
__Amy Yeah. Cool.
__Howard You know, I don't remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.
__Amy Oh, I do. It was three years ago.
__Amy So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.
__Amy I don't know. I really don't know.
__Leonard Hey.
__Howard Oh, good.
__Amy Oh, thank God.
__Penny You guys been here long?
__Howard No, two minutes.
__Amy But yes.
__Howard Where's Claire?
__Raj Oh, she's meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don't ask too many questions about the relationship. We're just keeping it casual.
__Leonard Oh, so I shouldn't ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?
__Raj Yeah, I know you're teasing, but watch out for karma.
__Amy Hey, Penny, isn't that your old boyfriend Zack?
__Penny Oh, yeah.
__Amy Are you gonna say hi to him?
__Penny Uh, I don't know.
__Raj Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.
__Sheldon Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I'll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.
__Bernadette So what do you want to do tonight?
__Bernadette There's more than one?
__Sheldon You've heard of French toast?
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Sheldon Cinnamon toast?
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Sheldon Melba toast?
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Sheldon You get where I'm going here?
__Bernadette Yeah.
__Penny Ah, there's definitely some oak.
__Raj Also, uh, cherries?
__Leonard I smell nothing.
__Howard Really? Nothing?
__Leonard Just a whole lot of Afrin.
__Zack Penny?
__Penny Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.
__Howard Yeah, hey, buddy.
__Amy Hello.
__Raj Hey.
__Zack Hey, did you two get married?
__Penny We did.
__Leonard Yeah, mm-hmm.
__Zack To each other?
__Penny Yes.
__Zack Cool. ‘Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Zack So how's the science world? What are you guys up to?
__Howard We've actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.
__Leonard But we won't bore you with the details.
__Zack Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.
__Howard Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.
__Zack So what's your invention?
__Howard Well, we're using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.
__Leonard What's neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
__Zack Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.
__Howard You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it'll run forever.
__Zack Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?
__Howard Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.
__Leonard And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
__Zack Is it better than the one they use now?
__Howard A lot.
__Leonard Way better.
__Zack Huh. You sure you guys are smart?
__Bernadette I'm sorry, I have to ask.
__Sheldon When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.
__Bernadette What is it about trains that you like so much?
__Sheldon What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.
__Bernadette That's lovely, Sheldon.
__Howard Me, too.
__Leonard Why didn't you say something?
__Howard Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer. It's not a pleasant topic.
__Raj You can't let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
__Amy It's true. Even Einstein's theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.
__Penny E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.
__Amy How do you know that?
__Penny Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.
__Claire Hey, Raj.
__Raj Hey, Claire. Good, you're here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We're casually dating, and there's no need for any further questions about it.
__Leonard Would you like a glass of wine?
__Raj I said no questions.
__Bernadette Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
__Sheldon You're gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.
__Bernadette Okay, but just for a little bit.
__Sheldon Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you're not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.
__Bernadette All right.
__Sheldon Ready?
__Bernadette You bet.
__Sheldon Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You're strong, beautiful and tall.
__Bernadette Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
__Sheldon I think you're gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.
__Sheldon You're parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.
__Bernadette Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.
__Sheldon What do you do?
__Bernadette I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.
__Sheldon He wants to see I.D.
__Claire Really? Like what?
__Amy Uh, mostly Penny's heard them.
__Zack Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.
__Raj Zack, this is my friend Claire.
__Zack You're hot. You seeing anybody?
__Raj Uh, she's seeing me.
__Zack Why'd you say she's your friend?
__Raj We're just keeping it casual.
__Zack Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.
__Claire I don't know. Ask him.
__Zack Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.
__Howard Take a step back? I'm not a young man any more.
__Leonard No, I mean re-evaluate what we're doing with the guidance system.
__Howard But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.
__Leonard What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?
__Howard Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.
__Leonard How?
__Howard Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.
__Leonard Very funny.
__Howard You got something better?
__Leonard Well, not really.
__Howard Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?
__Leonard Not a lot. I just couldn't start until you walked away.
__Bernadette Does it have eyes?
__Sheldon Three giant red ones and they never blink. It's unsettling.
__Bernadette I stab it in the middle eye.
__Sheldon Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It's low sodium. Aaaah.
__Bernadette Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.
__Sheldon Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you've had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they've ever been. The end.
__Bernadette Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.
__Sheldon Oh, the fun doesn't stop. You're still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.
__Bernadette Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I'm having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.
__Sheldon I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I've been Sheldon the Genius. Although I've never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don't understand. Which is ironic 'cause, you know, genius.
__Bernadette Well, thanks again.
__Sheldon You're welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.
__Bernadette I might just take you up on that.
__Sheldon Well, mind you now, that offer's only good until the third trimester. I can't risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.
__Zack What are you talking about?
__Raj I mean, come on, look at you. You're classically handsome, you've got a swimmer's body. Next to you, I look like me.
__Zack Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer's body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.
__Raj Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.
__Zack Anything for you, my little foreign friend.
__Claire So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?
__Penny Uh, you know, I'm not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.
__Leonard I don't think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.
__Howard Yeah. He still has an AOL address.
__Zack I see what you're saying. She's not so great.
__Zack Polo.
__Raj So, uh, what are you guys talking about?
__Claire Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you're dating.
__Raj Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
__Amy You just did.
__Zack Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.
__Sheldon Morning.
__Leonard Ugh. Too much wine.
__Sheldon Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.
__Leonard Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?
__Sheldon Of course.
__Leonard Does it bother you?
__Sheldon No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.
__Leonard Who are these people?
__Sheldon Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It's good to have extras under the sink.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Taylor Swift.
__Penny Yes. Pi.
__Sheldon Yes. Kardashian.
__Penny More specific.
__Sheldon Khloe?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it's Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it's Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it's Khloe.
__Penny Oh, that's a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?
__Leonard What are you guys doing?
__Sheldon Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.
__Leonard Oh, let me try.
__Penny Okay.
__Leonard Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, who is Mike Drop?
__Leonard Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?
__Penny Sure.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Penny No problem.
__Leonard Hey, Penny, um, since you're already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?
__Sheldon Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport?
__Leonard Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.
__Sheldon She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
__Penny You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
__Leonard Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.
__Leonard I don't know what he's putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.
__Penny Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.
__Leonard Seriously?
__Penny Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I'd like for us to have a good relationship.
__Leonard That is very mature of you, so I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah.
__Sheldon All right, back to learning.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.
__Penny Or as I know him?
__Sheldon Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.
__Penny Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.
__Leonard When's the screening?
__Raj Uh, it's tonight, but it's first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.
__Howard Let's do it.
__Leonard Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.
__Leonard You do realize we're allowed to have fun without you?
__Howard In fact, that's usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?
__Raj Uh, I'd say by three.
__Sheldon You're really going without me?
__Leonard It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we'll save a spot in line for you.
__Sheldon You don't have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I'll be cutting.
__Leonard People do it all the time.
__Sheldon You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
__Howard If you really care that much, there are apps now that'll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.
__Stuart People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.
__Howard Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
__Stuart And now I feel worse again.
__Penny Wow. Didn't even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let's talk about you. What would you like to do while you're here?
__Beverly Dear, I'm a psychiatrist. You don't have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.
__Penny Well, I'd actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband's sex organs.
__Beverly Very well. What's the last book you read?
__Penny Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?
__Penny Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?
__Beverly And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?
__Penny Uncomfortable.
__Beverly That was a joke, dear.
__Penny Oh. Sorry. Didn't know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?
__Beverly So just the two of us?
__Penny Or I invite a few girlfriends, 'cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.
__Amy What are you doing here? You're not Sheldon.
__Stuart I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.
__Amy Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?
__Stuart No, it's not like that. There's a long line he'd rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.
__Amy We're not going shopping together.
__Stuart You sure? I'm happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.
__Amy Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?
__Stuart Look, lady, I just work here.
__Sheldon Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?
__Raj Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.
__Leonard Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.
__Sheldon Stuart, what are you doing here?
__Stuart Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?
__Sheldon I don't understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?
__Stuart Oh, I'm not upset with you, but Amy's pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.
__Sheldon Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.
__Stuart You're darn right it's fair play, you selfish jerk.
__Beverly Maybe he couldn't get a word in edgewise.
__Amy I'm sorry, I've been going on and on.
__Beverly Oh, it's all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It's understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.
__Amy I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.
__Beverly Well, I do admire your resolve. You're an extraordinary woman.
__Amy Thank you.
__Penny You know, she's my mother-in-law. Why can't I bond with her like that?
__Bernadette Amy's with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You're with her son, who she doesn't.
__Amy Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?
__Beverly Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.
__Amy Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.
__Penny You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.
__Beverly Yes. Well, what can you do?
__Amy Maybe it's Sheldon, here to say he's sorry.
__Stuart Sheldon says he's sorry.
__Amy Bernadette, I'll give you five dollars to slam the door.
__Stuart I would have done it for three.
__Howard Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.
__Raj Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.
__Stuart Hey.
__Stuart Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.
__Sheldon Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?
__Stuart I said, Sheldon says he's sorry.
__Sheldon Oh, well, that's laying it on a little thick.
__Leonard You think it's time you apologize to her yourself?
__Sheldon I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I'll lose my spot.
__Stuart I'm happy to hold your place till you get back.
__Sheldon You would do that?
__Stuart Consider it my way of getting more of your money.
__Sheldon You're a good man.
__Beverly Oh, I didn't realize you two work together.
__Bernadette Well, we don't exactly. I'm a microbiologist for the research team.
__Beverly Oh, what are you currently developing?
__Bernadette Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
__Beverly That's interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.
__Amy Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.
__Beverly It was.
__Bernadette Well, let's get back to Penny. Hey, weren't you telling me something great about your company car?
__Penny Um, it has seat warmers.
__Sheldon Amy.  Amy.  Amy.
__Amy Come in.
__Sheldon Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I'd love to chat, but there's a line that could start moving any minute, so let's do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that's a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, 'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don't want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.
__Amy Fine.
__Sheldon Oh, thanks, you're a peach. Beverly, we'll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.
__Penny How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
__Raj You can't make me feel bad.
__Howard Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?
__Leonard So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?
__Sheldon I'm back.
__Leonard Hey, how'd it go?
__Stuart Anyone else need anything before I go?
__Howard I'll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.
__Stuart That's mean.
__Howard Five.
__Stuart You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.
__Sheldon Did you see that? He just cut the line.
__Leonard He's just joining his friends; it's fine.
__Howard We're near the front of the line. We'll get in either way.
__Sheldon What if every person in front of us let someone cut?
__Leonard We'd still get in.
__Sheldon What if each of those people let someone cut?
__Leonard Still get in.
__Sheldon But then each of those people let someone cut?
__Leonard We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you over the head with his stick chair.
__Sheldon Excuse me.
__Sheldon Uh, uh, I couldn't help but notice that you cut the line.
__Man Oh, uh, I'm with my friends. It's cool.
__Sheldon Well, no. It's not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon You need to go to the back of the line.
__Man Uh, who made you line monitor?
__Sheldon Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that's straight is a line that's great.
__Man Is this guy for real?
__Leonard Boy, I wish I could say no.
__Amy Well, he's come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.
__Beverly Your relationship with him is fascinating. I'm preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.
__Amy Oh, sure. I'll, I'll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette's husband is a former astronaut.
__Beverly Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?
__Bernadette Do I think he'd be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he's alone in the bathroom.
__Beverly Wonderful. I'll give you my contact information.
__Bernadette Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.
__Beverly About what?
__Penny Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I've been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I'm getting nowhere.
__Penny What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I'll take you not insulting me to my face.
__Beverly My intention was never to insult you.
__Penny You've been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?
__Beverly Well, it's not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.
__Penny Okay, good example.
__Man The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.
__Sheldon They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?
__Man As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.
__Raj He's got him there. The D even stands for department.
__Sheldon Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?
__Man Told you.
__Sheldon Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you've all been so ground down by life, you don't even notice when someone disrespects you.
__Howard I can't believe we're gonna get beat up, and it's not because of your chair.
__Sheldon You know, right now, at the back of this line, there's a movie fan like you who's not going to get in, because this person simply doesn't care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.
__Leonard Okay, you may have to pretend you're black to get us out of here.
__Sheldon Now, let's follow in that brave woman's footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…
__Woman Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.
__Sheldon I most certainly did not.
__Woman I saw you.
__Man If you're feeling dizzy, it's because the tables have turned.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he's gonna get in.
__Leonard Buddy, let it go.
__Sheldon No, I can't. This isn't right.
__Leonard You did everything you could.
__Sheldon No, I could've done more.
__Leonard Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That's all anyone could ask.
__Amy I know how you feel. She didn't invite any of us.
__Bernadette But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.
__Beverly I could've watched it on the Internet?
__Penny Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would've come?
__Beverly No, I would've said you're making a huge mistake. But an invitation would've been nice.
__Penny You really think we made a mistake?
__Beverly At the time I did. But I've never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.
__Penny Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you're still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you're interested.
__Beverly I would find that perfectly acceptable.
__Penny She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.
__Howard I'm fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that's a good question, Jim. Don't you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he's a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.
__Penny Hi, how was the screening?
__Leonard Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.
__Penny Ugh, I should've never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.
__Leonard How'd it go with my mother?
__Penny Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.
__Leonard Wow. Well done.
__Penny Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.
__Leonard Did she think you were choking or… I'm sorry, that's great. Thank you for spending time with her.
__Penny No problem. Um, so listen, I don't know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we'd have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.
__Leonard Wait, we're gonna get married again?
__Penny Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.
__Leonard Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
__Penny Come on, it'll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn't invite her to the first one.
__Leonard Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don't like her.
__Penny Leonard, come on, she's your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn't we?
__Leonard I just said why, we don't like her.
__Penny Hey, look, then forget about her, let's do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.
__Leonard Is your brother out of prison?
__Penny Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.
__Leonard I'd love it if my dad could come.
__Penny Oh, you have to invite him. I haven't seen him since the divorce.
__Leonard Oh, he's like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.
__Penny Well, then it's settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy So there's no maid of honour?
__Penny No.
__Amy Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?
__Penny I don't see how I could.
__Amy Then I graciously accept.
__Bernadette Who's going to officiate?
__Penny I was kind of hoping you would.
__Amy Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honour?
__Penny Okay, wait, you're inviting people to our wedding?
__Sheldon Yes, I'm inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I've already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don't get your hopes up, 'cause he's pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.
__Bernadette Who's Erno Rubik?
__Sheldon Seriously? He invented the Rubik's Cube.
__Penny Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?
__Sheldon Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.
__Bernadette Well, it's very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard's mother.
__Penny Yeah, I'm also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.
__Leonard Sorry, but I don't think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.
__Beverly You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.
__Leonard I know, and there's no excuse for that.
__Beverly He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn't shown him any physical affection for years.
__Leonard I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.
__Raj You sure?
__Howard Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.
__Raj You're right. You realize what this means?
__Howard Yeah. I do. It's proof of concept. We've got a workable guidance system.
__Raj Congratulations.
__Howard Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.
__Raj Open it.
__Howard Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That's weird.
__Raj Is there a window around here we don't know about?
__Howard I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
__Raj Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.
__Sheldon Oh, you're welcome.
__Mary I was speaking to your young lady.
__Amy My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.
__Mary Oh, please call me Mary.
__Amy Okay, Mary.
__Sheldon You know, that doesn't work for me, let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.
__Mary Sheldon, don't be silly.
__Sheldon Wu-wu, what? That's what I called you till I got to know you better.
__Mary It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.
__Sheldon Well, actually, I…
__Amy It sure was.
__Mary I've always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I take care of him.
__Mary Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?
__Amy Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny's family is coming tomorrow.
__Sheldon Yeah, and Leonard's mother's already here.
__Mary Oh, Beverly. How nice.
__Amy You've met her, right?
__Mary Yes, I have.
__Sheldon Mother, she's an atheist, not a vampire.
__Mary Either way, let's stop and get some garlic.
__Mary Well, thank you so much for asking. I've been well, and you?
__Beverly Very good.
__Mary Good.
__Sheldon I don't know what we were worried about, they're getting along great.
__Mary Sheldon tells me your husband's coming.
__Beverly My ex-husband.
__Mary Oh, I'm so sorry.
__Beverly Don't be.
__Mary All right.
__Penny Whew, chilly.
__Amy I think I can see my breath.
__Beverly We can hear you.
__Penny Sorry.
__Amy Sorry.
__Bernadette Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.
__Howard Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I'm no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.
__Howard Oh, please, that's not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.
__Bernadette You do realize those weren't documentaries, right?
__Howard I'm sorry, you find this funny?
__Raj No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.
__Alfred Hofstadter When are they gonna fix your elevator?
__Leonard Uh, I don't, any day now.
__Alfred Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I'll have a heart attack and not have to see her.
__Leonard Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I'm really glad you're here.
__Alfred Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.
__Leonard Penny's really looking forward to seeing you.
__Alfred Ah, she's a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.
__Leonard Thanks, Dad.
__Alfred How the hell did you do that?
__Leonard Hey, we're here.
__Penny Alfred. Thank you for coming!
__Alfred Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard Dad, you remember Sheldon.
__Sheldon Dr. Hofstadter.
__Alfred Dr. Cooper.
__Leonard This is Sheldon's mother, Mary.
__Alfred How do you do?
__Mary Nice to meet you.
__Leonard And his girlfriend, Amy.
__Alfred A pleasure.
__Amy Hi.
__Leonard And, of course, Mom.
__Alfred Hello, my hateful shrew.
__Beverly Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.
__Sheldon All right, now I'm starting to sense a little tension.
__Leonard All right, you two, don't start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?
__Alfred Of course. I'm sorry.
__Beverly Oh, look at that, you can apologize.
__Leonard Mom.
__Beverly I'm sorry.
__Mary You know, the Bible says forgiveness…
__Sheldon Mom.
__Mary I'm sorry.
__Penny Uh, who's hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.
__Sheldon It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon I'm not sorry. That's true.
__Raj You can't ignore it. It's not that postcard that says it's time to go back to the dentist.
__Bernadette Guys, come on. We're meeting everyone for dinner.
__Howard One sec. I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.
__Raj Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they're probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.
__Bernadette Are you done with this nonsense?
__Howard It's not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.
__Raj Oh, if it's even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.
__Howard You're right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they're using it against us.
__Raj I also love the enemies of America.
__Penny No, of course not.
__Beverly Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.
__Leonard Mom, please save something for the toast.
__Alfred Oh, I'm an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.
__Mary My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.
__Sheldon Don't laugh, she wasn't joking.
__Amy Play with your phone.
__Alfred Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.
__Mary I don't have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that's very interesting.
__Alfred Oh. I, I didn't mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.
__Mary Really?
__Alfred Yes. Yes, I'm an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.
__Mary Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.
__Howard Are you kidding? They're probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.
__Raj What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.
__Howard I'm being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.
__Raj I'd like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.
__Beverly Yeah.
__Leonard Is that Howard in front of us?
__Penny Oh, maybe. Get closer.
__ Howard's car.
__ Oh, God. I think someone's following us.
__Bernadette You're being ridiculous.
__Howard I'm not being ridiculous, he's right on my tail.
__Raj Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.
__ Leonard's car.
__ Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant's the other way.
__Leonard I don't know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there's an accident.
__Penny Oh, so follow him.
__ Howard's car.
__ Oh, no.
__Howard I told you.
__Bernadette It's probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.
__ Leonard's car.
__ Well, go faster. You're losing him.
__Leonard What is his hurry?
__Penny You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it's you.
__ Howard's car.
__ He's flashing his lights. What's that mean?
__Raj I, I think he wants us to pull over.
__Bernadette Do not pull over. I'm not raising this baby alone.
__Howard Hang on.
__Mary No, just focused on work and the church.
__Alfred Ah. And what do you do?
__Alfred Well, they're lucky to have you.
__Mary Well, thank you.
__Alfred You're welcome.
__Amy Do you realize what's happening here?
__Sheldon Yeah, I do. They're filling up on bread and ruining their meal.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Hey.
__Amy What took you guys so long?
__Leonard Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.
__Penny So, what did we miss?
__Mary Leonard, your father is just charming.
__Beverly He's also broke. Did he mention that?
__Leonard Okay, Mom, you sit over there.
__Penny Yeah, I'm gonna call Bernadette and see what's keeping them.
__Sheldon If I'd known you were broke, I wouldn't have made a big deal about the bread.
__Howard I'm telling you, I'm not on drugs. The government's out to get me.
__Mary Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon's father.
__Sheldon That's funny, because my father was not a very clever man.
__Amy I'd be lost without you.
__Leonard Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
__Sheldon See, that's funny because…
__Amy Back to your phone.
__Leonard Penny, I've always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.
__Penny Oh, thanks for asking until I did.
__Amy Hear, hear.
__Leonard Cheers.
__Alfred I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.
__Penny Aw.
__Alfred Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.
__Beverly What the hell is that supposed to mean?
__Alfred Why don't you take a pill?
__Beverly Like you did before sex?
__Alfred What I really needed was a blindfold.
__Mary All right, everyone, calm down. Let' He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty.
__Beverly Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?
__Mary When God writes one, I will.
__Penny Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that.
__Alfred Leonard, if you don't mind, I, I think I'm a little tired. I'm gonna call it a night.
__Leonard Sure, Dad.
__Alfred Would you like to share a cab?
__Mary That would be fine.
__Alfred Where are you staying?
__Mary I'm at the Westin.
__Mary I think that you could.
__Leonard What is happening there?
__Sheldon I think it's pretty obvious. They don't want dessert 'cause they filled up on bread.
__Leonard My father's not texting me back.
__Penny ‘Cause they both turned their phones off.
__Sheldon I don't like this at all.
__Leonard I don't like it either.
__Penny Really? ‘Cause I love it.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon You realize you and I could become brothers.
__Leonard We're not gonna be brothers. We're not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
__Sheldon I hope you're right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother's wife is weird.
__Leonard Go to sleep.
__Sheldon Okay. Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things to my mother?
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
__Penny Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
__Sheldon Very well.
__Leonard I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
__Penny God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.
__Sheldon Hey, if you want me to sleep you're gonna have to stop talking.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Yeah, drive safe.
__Penny Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you're concerned, you don't know anything, you didn't see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
__Sheldon It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
__Penny What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I'm sorry, I got to go now.
__Beverley Penny, wait.
__Penny Why?
__Beverley I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.
__Sheldon Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what's wrong?
__Beverley I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.
__Sheldon Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
__Sheldon Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?
__Beverley I don't see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.
__Sheldon Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you're talking about, however accurately.
__Penny Okay, Beverley, aren't you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.
__Sheldon And turned their phones off.
__Leonard Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.
__Penny Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.
__Beverley Well, we can't have that.
__Sheldon You know, also, if they did have coitus, we'll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.
__Howard Maybe to you. You didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.
__Bernadette Because you were driving like a lunatic.
__Raj Oh, I'll get it.
__Bernadette It didn't help that you couldn't walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
__Howard I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.
__Raj Hello.
__Air Force Officer I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.
__Air Force Officer I have the right address, don't I?
__Raj Address?
__Air Force Officer Is he here?
__Raj Um, no.
__Air Force Officer Do you know where I can find him?
__Raj May I ask what this is about?
__Air Force Officer No, you may not.
__Raj Very well.
__Air Force Officer Have him call me.
__Raj Okay.
__Howard Raj, who's at the door?
__Raj That's not him.
__Susan Susan (Penny's mother): Like what? Do they know about your brother?
__Penny Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.
__Susan Why would you do that?
__Penny What?
__Susan The world doesn't need to know our problems.
__Penny Well, Mom, I'm sorry, but…
__Wyatt Wyatt (Penny's father): Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.
__Susan You really think it's helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?
__Wyatt Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.
__Susan Well, quit it.
__Penny So, uh, Randall, can't believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.
__Randall Randall (Penny's brother): Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn't have left the state.
__Susan All right, that's enough jail talk.
__Randall Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.
__Susan You sent your brother cigarettes?
__Wyatt He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.
__Susan Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat's picture on it.
__Wyatt Anyway, we're here, slugger.
__Raj What are you talking about? They've always known where you live.
__Bernadette Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother's house.
__Bernadette Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.
__Howard All right, all right.
__Raj Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren't home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.
__Howard Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.
__Raj Oh, I take it back, don't mention me.
__Howard Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don't know his immigration status. Relax, I'm still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?
__Raj That's what he said to me.
__Beverley Thank you.
__Leonard I'm glad you decided to stay. It's gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
__Beverley I can't wait for this day to be over.
__Leonard Yeah, special, like that.  That's them. Please don't make things any more awkward than they already are.
__Sheldon All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.
__Leonard Hey, guys, come on in.
__Alfred Oh, thank you.
__Mary Good morning.
__Beverley Morning.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Alfred Good, good.
__Beverley Good.
__Mary I'm good, too.
__Beverley Good.
__Sheldon So, did you defile my mother or not?
__Mary Sheldon. You're being rude.
__Alfred If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.
__Sheldon Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
__Mary That's enough.
__Alfred Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.
__Leonard You don't know his girlfriend very well.
__Sheldon Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
__Randall You know, It's hard to believe I've never met Leonard.
__Wyatt Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.
__Susan Not funny, Wyatt.
__Penny I thought it was really funny.
__Wyatt Thanks.
__Susan Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who's there? Our family is an embarrassment.
__Randall That's not much of a joke.
__Penny Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.
__Susan Oh, I'm sorry. It's just we're meeting Leonard's parents for the first time, and, and they're academics and, and intellectuals, and I don't want them thinking we're white trash.
__Randall Well, what colour trash do you think they'll believe?
__Sheldon A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You're kind of a sucker.
__Leonard Well, nothing happened, right? It's over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.
__Alfred Well, you know, actually that's not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.
__Mary Mm-hmm. And he's never been to Texas.
__Alfred Maybe we meet halfway.
__Sheldon What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can't be the only one that knows that's halfway.
__Beverley You're not seriously going to visit each other.
__Alfred And why wouldn't we?
__Beverley Oh please, you're just saying this to antagonize me.
__Alfred Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that's just a bonus.
__Leonard Mary, I'm sorry you're in the middle of this.
__Mary No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.
__Sheldon What? But he's a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He's basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.
__Leonard Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom?
__Sheldon Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?
__Leonard This is ridiculous. I'm going across the hall.
__Sheldon But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
__Leonard Fine, then you go.
__Mary Well, I don't want to stay here with her. I'll go.
__Alfred I'll go with you.
__Leonard That still leaves me here with him.
__Sheldon Hang on, hang on. We' Mary and Beverley can't be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can't be together. Leonard and I can't be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don't like his face. Oh, here. I've got it.
__Amy Who's ready for a wedding?
__Sheldon Great, now I have to start all over.
__Penny Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
__Susan See what happens when you work hard?
__Randall Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make 'em.
__Susan Okay, that's enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.
__Wyatt I'll drink to that.
__Susan Haven't you had enough?
__Wyatt Penny drinks more than I do.
__Penny Well, I learned from the best.
__Wyatt Aw.
__Penny Aw.
__Susan Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.
__Randall You see what I've gotta put up with.
__Susan What you've gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?
__Randall It's called getting caught, Mother.
__Leonard Hello.
__Wyatt Hey, there he is.
__Penny Hey.
__Susan Oh, Leonard. It's so nice to see you again.
__Leonard Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.
__Beverley Hello.
__Susan Hi.
__Randall We are not white trash.
__Alfred Yes, I am. I'm just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I've caused.
__Mary Oh, so am I.
__Sheldon You made God sad today, Mom.
__Amy Sheldon, they haven't done anything wrong. I think it's nice they're hitting it off.
__Sheldon Well, that's still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn't even hold hands for two years.
__Amy It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
__Alfred You're a patient young lady.
__Sheldon Hey, hey. She's mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.
__Raj Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.
__Howard That's really stupid advice.
__Raj You know that hurts my feelings.
__Howard Calm down, try not to think about it.
__Raj Okay.
__Howard Why do I bother talking to you?
__Raj Oh, come on. What's the worst that could come of this meeting?
__Howard I don't know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?
__Raj Okay, that's not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.
__Howard What's the point of that story?
__Raj I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.  There he is, there's my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that's the smile I'm gonna remember when you're living in the desert and I'm living with your wife.
__Randall Mommy, you want to take this one?
__Susan Um, Randall's in between jobs.
__Randall And court appearances.
__Wyatt It's nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I'm looking forward to meeting his father.
__Beverley Prepare to be disappointed.
__Leonard And he can't wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?
__Wyatt Well, I could use another beer.
__Susan You're done. He's done.
__Penny Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
__Randall Not at all.
__Beverley Nice to see you, too.
__Stuart Hi, I'm Stuart.
__Alfred Oh, I'm Alfred. Leonard's father.
__Stuart Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I'm sorry, did you two want to sit together?
__Together No.
__Stuart I was wondering why the front row was available.
__Bernadette Okay, I think we're ready.
__Sheldon Why do people cry at weddings?
__Mary They're practicing for what's coming later.
__Randall Thank you for my new teeth.
__Bernadette We're here today to celebrate love.
__Beverley Urgh.
__Alfred Sigh louder, no one heard you.
__Stuart Really, I can move.
__Bernadette Not just Leonard and Penny's love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
__Bernadette Love is patient, but it's not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let's knock it off.
__Howard At least she's yelling at someone else for a change.
__Bernadette Howard.
__Penny Okay, I understand everyone's a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.
__Leonard Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don't think I'll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don't
__ need to understand it, I just need to be grateful. I love you, Penny.
__ Oh.
__Bernadette Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn't think so.
__ But something wonderful did come from our relationship. That young man right there.
__ I couldn't agree more.
__Stuart That's beautiful.
__Bernadette Thank you. All right, let's continue.
__Sheldon Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can't wait any longer.
__Amy It's happening.
__Sheldon Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don't always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.
__Penny Oh.
__Bernadette Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
__Leonard Hey, I'm just thrilled we're all getting along for a minute.
__Alfred Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I'm sorry if I upset you.
__Beverley Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don't you get into the carpool lane?
__Alfred Well, that's a solid line. He can't cross that.
__Leonard That's okay. I can make it over.
__Beverley No, no, let's plod along. It'll make your father feel more comfortable.
__Alfred What makes me comfortable is knowing I don't have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.
__Beverley Do the world a favour, and don't wake up tomorrow morning.
__Leonard That was almost a minute.
__Amy You'll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
__Mary Good. Thank you.
__Sheldon Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
__Mary Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
__Sheldon Yes ma'am.
__Sheldon Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.
__Amy I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
__Sheldon What, you're not my mother.
__Mary Don't you be disrespectful to her.
__Sheldon Yes ma'am.
__Penny Oh, thanks, Mom.
__Susan Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.
__Penny Is he? I never noticed.
__Wyatt He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.
__Randall Cops, cops, be cool.
__Leonard So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
__Sheldon Well, he doesn't say it's a good game.
__Howard All right, we got a problem.
__Leonard What's up?
__Howard The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.
__Leonard Really?
__Raj Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard's door. He was terrifying.
__Sheldon Oh, what did he say?
__Sheldon That doesn't sound terrifying.
__Raj To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.
__Leonard You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.
__Howard And if that happens, we'll never be able to sell it commercially.
__Leonard There goes our big payday.
__Howard I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don't have to try so hard in bed.
__Leonard You do that, too?
__Howard Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?
__Sheldon Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn't that exciting?
__Raj Well, you're kidding, right?
__Sheldon Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn't you ever think, hey, that could be me?
__Howard Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.
__Sheldon Okay, Howard's on board. What do you think, Leonard?
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.
__Bernadette He won't take any pills that aren't chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
__Penny You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.
__Amy Does that help?
__Penny Well, for a while. Then he comes back.
__Bernadette I don't believe this.
__Amy What's wrong?
__Bernadette This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
__Amy You did already know, right?
__Bernadette No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?
__Penny No. You told me not to.
__Bernadette I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she's so great.
__Amy Why don't you want anyone to know?
__Bernadette ‘Cause I'm up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I'm pregnant they might give it to someone else.
__Penny Would they really do that?
__Bernadette I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.
__Leonard Are you crazy? You can't put that on Snapchat.
__Howard You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.
__Leonard That's not a bad idea.
__Raj Well, you must have someone in your family that's a lawyer.
__Howard Why? Because I'm Jewish? That's like me saying, hey, you're Indian, doesn't your cousin work in a call centre?
__Raj My cousin does work in a call centre.
__Howard And my cousin's a lawyer.
__Sheldon We don't need Howard's cousin. No, we have me.
__Leonard You're not a lawyer, Sheldon, you're just a know-it-all.
__Sheldon I am not a know-it-all. I'm a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they're wrong.
__Leonard That's the definition of being a know-it-all.
__Sheldon Or in German, a Besserwisser.
__Bernadette I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
__Amy Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?
__Bernadette From all the Dove Bars I ate. I'm pregnant. Try to keep up. I'm sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows.
__Amy Well, whatever happens, we're here for you.
__Bernadette Thanks. You guys are the best.
__Penny Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I'm the one who blabbed she was pregnant!
__Amy What?
__Penny I didn't mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…
__Bernadette I forgot my coat.
__Penny Oh, here's your coat, honey. That's such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.
__Amy Oh, but you did it so well. That's amazing, it's like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.
__Penny Is that really what's important right now?
__Amy I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you're being dishonest so I can see what lights up.
__Penny That's super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can't wait to do that.
__Amy I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin' up from here.
__Sheldon I don't see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
__Howard First of all, he's in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he's clearly a smart guy.
__Howard's cousin Howard' Hello.
__Howard Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.
__Marty Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.
__Howard Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we're even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.
__Leonard Hi.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Howard And this is my friend, Raj.
__Raj Oh, I'm not on the patent. I'm just here because there's a bumblebee in my office.
__Leonard I saw it. It's big.
__Howard Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting's on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?
__Marty Well, I don't know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don't sign anything.
__Sheldon Don't sign anything? That's your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you'd recommend that we leave that unsigned?
__Marty That's not what I meant.
__Sheldon That's what you said.
__Marty That's not what I meant.
__Sheldon This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don't mean and meaning things you don't say.
__Marty Howard, why is he yelling at me?
__Sheldon Who has been a complete waste of our time?
__Howard Marty, let me call you back.
__Leonard Someday, when I'm up on murder charges, you'll be hearing from me.
__Sheldon You don't need him. I'll represent you.
__Penny Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.
__Bernadette Oh. How was it?
__Penny Great.
__Bernadette Fell asleep?
__Penny In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you're pregnant?
__Bernadette I'm furious.
__Penny Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?
__Bernadette No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn't know what I was talking about.
__Penny Hmm. Well, I guess it's just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.
__Bernadette It had to be Barbara. I've been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
__Penny Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.
__Bernadette What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She's got to pay.
__Penny Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I'm just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me. I'm the reason everyone knows.
__Bernadette Why did you do that?
__Penny Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.
__Bernadette Get out.
__Penny Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.
__Leonard ‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people.
__Sheldon Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?
__Leonard I'm getting enraged.
__Sheldon Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?
__Howard No.
__Leonard Don't speak.
__Sheldon's phone Sheldon' Aw, nuts.
__Colonel Williams Gentlemen, I'm Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.
__Howard Hello.
__Colonel Williams So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?
__Howard It's a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.
__Leonard Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.
__Colonel Williams Well, I'm a scientist by training.
__Howard Really? You're a physicist?
__Colonel Williams Better. I'm an engineer.
__Leonard Where did you go to school?
__Colonel Williams MIT.
__Howard Oh. Well, hey, me, too.
__Colonel Williams I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I'll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there's an application for this technology, and we're interested in funding your research.
__Howard Well, thanks, but you should know we're a little concerned about this being used in weapons.
__Leonard I don't know how I feel about this.
__Colonel Williams Look, guys, it's just a guidance system. It's not like you're handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it's this big, and we need it to be this big.
__Leonard That's a lot less big.
__Colonel Williams Yes, it's this much less big.
__Howard I'm not even sure that's possible.
__Colonel Williams Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.
__Howard Four months?
__Sheldon Yeah, we'll do it in two. Hi. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I'm the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren't real scientists, MIT's a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service.
__Bernadette Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.
__Amy I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
__Bernadette Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
__Amy Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I'm guessing still angry?
__Bernadette I'm sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I'm stressing.
__Amy You really think they're gonna start treating you differently?
__Bernadette Are you kidding? I've always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn't that's a scientist, it's I wonder if her mommy
__ knows where she is.
__ I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.
__Bernadette I've worked so hard to get where I am, and I don't want to get sent back to square one because I'm pregnant.
__Amy I understand how you feel.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__Amy I wish there were some way I could make it better.
__Bernadette Well, you brought me French fries. That's a start.
__Amy Uh, actually, I got you apple slices 'cause you're pregnant.
__Bernadette Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald's and gets fruit?
__Amy I'll be right back.
__Bernadette And a chocolate shake.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Penny What are you doing?
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard's mad at me, so I'm making him lemon bars.
__Penny Does he even like lemon bars?
__Sheldon Not really. But I'm mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.
__Penny Something happen at the meeting?
__Sheldon They made me promise I wouldn't talk.
__Penny And you talked?
__Sheldon Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn't they? Anyway, now we're committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone's upset with me.
__Penny Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette's mad at me, too.
__Sheldon Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.
__Penny Why would that make me feel better?
__Sheldon Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.
__Penny Okay. Never mind.
__Sheldon Look, I'm sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.
__Penny Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant. She wasn't ready for them to know.
__Sheldon Why would you do that?
__Penny Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.
__Sheldon See, that's exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.
__Howard Well, maybe. I don't know. We'll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
__Leonard Which means I won't be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she'll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.
__Howard I love your French toast.
__Leonard Oh, thanks, man.
__Raj So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?
__Howard We didn't. Sheldon did.
__Raj And you just let him?
__Leonard Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.
__Howard No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.
__Raj So I guess I won't be seeing you guys for a while.
__Leonard Oh, looks like it.
__Raj Wow. You're going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.
__Howard Would you stop? We're just gonna be on the other side of campus.
__Raj And right here.
__Howard You are a deeply silly man.
__Raj He is so afraid of his feelings.
__Bernadette Got a minute?
__Penny Yeah, come on in.
__Bernadette I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.
__Penny Oh, thank you, and I'm sorry I lied about it.
__Bernadette For what it's worth, you're a great liar.
__Penny Oh, that's what Amy said. So what's going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?
__Bernadette Well, my boss said he hadn't decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he's an old rich white guy, and I'm a sweet little pregnant lady who's not afraid to crying front of a jury.
__Penny You threatened to sue?
__Bernadette Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you're four feet eleven and eye level with every guy's crotch, that's where you punch.
__Penny That's funny. I learned something totally different.
__Bernadette Do you know what? It's just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It's all I need to give my life meaning.
__Penny Oh, that's so beautiful.
__Bernadette You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I'll have the jury eating out of my hand.
__Howard Maybe that's because it's classified.
__Leonard Wish we weren't so far from my parking space.
__Sheldon The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that's a good thing.
__Leonard I'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
__Sheldon Why? It clearly doesn't work.
__Howard I guess this is it.
__Leonard Is that a retinal scanner?
__Howard Let's find out.
__Scanner Howard Wolowitz, access granted.
__Leonard No way.
__Sheldon Impressive.
__Leonard Oh, my turn, my turn.
__Scanner Leonard Hofstadter, access granted.
__Leonard I didn't even have to take my glasses off/
__Scanner Access denied.
__Leonard and Sheldon It knows.
__Scanner Howard Wolowitz, access granted.
__All Yay.
__Leonard Sure, I'm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.
__Sheldon Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day's thoughts.
__Howard What?
__Sheldon It's called sleep and it's my bedtime. Nighty-night, y'all.
__Howard Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere.
__Leonard We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
__Sheldon I know, I was there.
__Howard Well, wake up, we're gonna put in a lot of late nights.
__Sheldon How late?
__Howard Well, I don't know, midnight, one.
__Sheldon One o'clock? I'm not a raccoon.
__Howard If you're tired, have some coffee.
__Sheldon What? You have some coffee.
__Howard I am having coffee.
__Sheldon And look how irritable it's making you!
__Leonard Guys, we're not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try
__ to soldier through?
__ Fine.  I don't think I can go much longer.
__Leonard It's been three and a half minutes, wake up.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.
__Penny Good morning.
__Leonard What is this?
__Amy Well, we didn't see you last night, we're not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.
__Leonard Oh, that is so nice.
__Sheldon Ow, it does hurt.
__Leonard So, what are you guys gonna do today?
__Amy Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don't think that's happening.
__Sheldon Oh, that was never happening.
__Penny Oh, I'll go. I like a party.
__Penny It's okay, I'll still go.
__Leonard You don't think you'll be bored?
__Penny Oh, I'll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don't understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?
__Sheldon I won't be there.
__Leonard Look at that, it is a party.
__Bernadette It's okay.
__Howard Thanks again for breakfast.
__Raj Well, I didn't get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.
__Bernadette You shouldn't have made the alarm code his birthday.
__Raj So, what should we do today?
__Bernadette Oh, I appreciate it, but you don't have to spend your day off with me.
__Raj Well, I don't mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?
__Bernadette Not really.
__Raj Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.
__Bernadette I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother's for Christmas.
__Raj Oh, I know, why don't we get started on clearing out the baby's room?
__Bernadette Isn't it a little early for that?
__Raj You have to get to it eventually.
__Bernadette Oh, there's so much junk in there, it's embarrassing.
__Raj How can you be embarrassed around me? I'm gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
__Bernadette I don't think you are.
__Raj You didn't think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.
__Sheldon Huh, what?
__The Flash You look tired. Why don't you have an energy drink? Everyone's doing it.
__Sheldon Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.
__The Flash Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.
__Sheldon I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk's delicious watery cousin.
__The Flash All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.
__Sheldon Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
__The Flash You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.
__Sheldon I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.
__The Flash Here. It's on the house.
__Sheldon The first one's free? Flash, how do you stay in business?
__The Flash You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.
__Penny Hi.
__Bert Hey, come on in. I'll gonna go turn on some rock music. That's a geology joke.
__Amy Bert's a geologist.
__Bert And a joker.
__Penny How early are we?
__Amy Oh, actually, we're an hour late.
__Penny I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.
__Raj Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.
__Bernadette Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you're here.
__Raj Oh, that's a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?
__Bernadette My dad built it for me.
__Raj Wow, it's so cute.
__Bernadette This was the husband and this was the wife. They'd go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.
__Raj Oh, and did they have kids?
__Bernadette They did, but the mommy and daddy didn't like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.
__Raj Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.
__Bernadette Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you're never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you're pregnant. And it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
__Raj I skipped spin class for this.
__Leonard Oh, it's complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine
__ uncomfortably intimate.
__ Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let's science the faeces out of this. That's The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.
__Leonard Are you okay?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we're not fat enough, or wearing diapers.
__Howard You wanted him awake.
__Amy I don't know where everyone is.
__Penny Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.
__Bert Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don't have to stay. I'm gonna start cleaning up.
__Amy Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.
__Penny Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.
__Bert Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, 'cause you're you and I'm me, and it's kind of embarrassing.
__Penny Wait, what do you mean she's her?
__Bert Well, you know how Amy's the coolest girl on campus, right?
__Penny No.
__Amy No.
__Bert Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.
__Penny What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?
__Amy I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.
__Bert Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's popular because he's dating you.
__Penny Now Sheldon's popular? What is happening?
__Sheldon My head hurts and I'm more tired than ever.
__Howard Why don't you just go home?
__Sheldon No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I want another one.
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon That's a craving. That's a sign of chemical dependency.
__Leonard You only had one.
__Sheldon No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can't stop.
__Howard You can't develop a problem that fast.
__Sheldon You want to bet? Oh, great, now I'm addicted to gambling.
__Leonard We can't afford to lose any more time.
__Howard Well, this probably won't work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?
__Leonard That's not helpful. It's fun to think about, but it's not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can't do this without you. Can you please pull it together?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Yes, of course.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.
__Howard No worries.
__Sheldon You guys stink.
__Raj I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it's fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?
__Bernadette Does it really need one?
__Raj Of course it does. Didn't your baby room have a theme?
__Bernadette Well, it doubled as my dad's office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.
__Raj Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don't we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.
__Bernadette Are you just gonna name all the colours?
__Bernadette I don't care what colour the room is.
__Raj Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.
__Raj Sorry. Sorry.
__Penny You trend setter.
__Amy Just the right idea at the right time.
__Penny Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool. Tell me about Leonard.
__Bert Who?
__Penny Leonard Hofstadter.
__Bert Oh, him. I guess he's all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.
__Penny That's me, I'm her. You know, he didn't trick me, he just wore me down.
__Bert It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.
__Amy And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.
__Penny You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.
__Amy Well, it's not exactly like it. We're all extremely smart.
__Penny Wow, you popular girls are mean.
__Sheldon Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?
__Leonard Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.
__Sheldon I do.
__Leonard You don't.
__Leonard No, you don't. But let's say you do. And don't say you do, because you don't. Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?
__Sheldon With what?
__Leonard Your problem.
__Sheldon I thought I didn't have a problem.
__Howard That was painful to watch.
__Bernadette I don't know.
__Raj Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
__Raj I'm sorry?
__Bernadette It's my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don't. What's wrong with me?
__Raj Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.
__Bernadette I keep waiting to feel excited, but it's not happening. What if it never happens?
__Raj Bernadette, come on, look, you're overthinking this, okay? You're gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don't believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.
__Bernadette Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.
__Raj Happy and well-fed. You see, that's what I'm taking from that story.
__Leonard Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
__Sheldon Howard, can I ask you a question?
__Howard No.
__Sheldon All right, I'll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn't find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…
__Leonard Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don't have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove 'em wherever you want, I don't care.
__Sheldon You don't shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
__Leonard Right. Listen to me. We can't do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
__Sheldon I can't.
__Leonard Yes, you can.
__Sheldon No, I can't figure out the math. I've been racking my brain for days, and I've got nothing.
__Leonard Seriously?
__Sheldon I can't do it. I'm not as smart as I think I am. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.
__Leonard It's okay, we'll figure something out.
__Sheldon But what if we can't?
__Leonard It'll be fine. You'll see. Sheldon? Buddy?
__Howard When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.
__ Bert's apartment.
__ Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.
__Bert My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?
__Amy I think we're good.
__Penny Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.
__Bert You need to leave. I'm in love with both of you now.
__Penny Okay.
__Amy Bye.
__Bernadette What? Why? Who are you calling? You're gonna rat me out to Howard, aren't you? You're such a snitch, no wonder I don't like you.
__Raj Whoa, I'm calling my dad, okay? He's got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he's an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.
__Dr Koothrapalli Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?
__Raj What? No.
__Dr Koothrapalli Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?
__Raj No.
__Dr Koothrapalli Great. What's up?
__Raj This is my friend, Bernadette. She's pregnant, and she's a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.
__Dr Koothrapalli Of course. What seems to be the trouble?
__Bernadette Something's wrong. I don't care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.
__Bernadette But I thought I'd be more excited.
__Dr Koothrapalli Oh, being excited isn't a guarantee of anything. Rajesh's mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.
__Bernadette Thank you. I feel better now.
__Raj Well I don't.
__Dr Koothrapalli Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.
__Colonel Williams Well, you could try starting with sir.
__Leonard Right. Sorry, sir.
__Leonard Sir.
__Colonel Williams Hmm?
__Howard We've hit a bit of a snag. We're already behind schedule.
__Leonard I understand that we're under contract, and I don't know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we're not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.
__Colonel Williams How long do you need?
__Howard We, we're thinking, two years.
__Colonel Williams All right.
__Howard That's it? You're okay with that?
__Colonel Williams What, you think you're the first government contractor who isn't gonna deliver on time? We're still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.
__Leonard Thanks for understanding, sir.
__Howard Yes, thank you so much.
__Sheldon We, we really appreciate it.
__Leonard All right, pressure's off
__Howard Wanna see a movie?
__Sheldon Popcorn's on me.
__Leonard That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?
__Amy About five weeks.
__Penny Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?
__Amy Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.
__Penny Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?
__Amy They didn't say.
__Leonard Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can't have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
__Penny Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.
__Amy Really?
__Penny Of course. You can stay in Leonard's room, and we'll stay at my place.
__Amy You're sure that's not an inconvenience?
__Penny No, not at all.
__Leonard And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.
__Amy So, technically, I'd be moving in with my boyfriend?
__Penny I guess so. And I'd finally get to live alone with my husband.
__Amy Oh, my, this is a big step.
__Leonard Mm-hmm. For two of us, it's in the right direction.
__Sheldon Why are you all smiling like crazy people?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard It's only for five weeks.
__Penny Yeah, and we'll be right across the hall.
__Amy What do you think?
__Sheldon I don't know. What if living together kills the romance?
__Sheldon Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she's never even seen me unshaven.
__Leonard You just shaved yesterday. You're good for three months.
__Amy Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?
__Sheldon Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.
__Leonard Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.
__Sheldon If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it.
__Penny Don't be proud of that.
__Amy So, is that a yes?
__Sheldon Not yet. How will I learn if I'm comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I'm in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.
__Penny Well, where would you go?
__Sheldon Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.
__Leonard And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914
__Penny Wait. Why don't you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?
__Sheldon Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I'd need to knock every time I came over here.
__Leonard That's a good question. Maybe just don't come over.
__Sheldon Historically, I don't do well with change.
__Penny Okay, it won't be that bad. We wouldn't even sit in your spot while you're gone.
__Sheldon You're darn right, you wouldn't. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.
__Leonard Just nod and smile. He's almost gone.
__Amy Sheldon, what do you think?
__Sheldon Very well. I'm on board.
__Amy Seriously?
__Sheldon Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
__Amy Oh. This is so exciting.
__Sheldon Well, now, don't be surprised if, like Star Trek, it's cancelled in three.
__Howard Cool. ‘Cause she says you're doing a great job as weird friend who doesn't have to be at every appointment.
__Raj I'm the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.
__Bernadette It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.
__Raj The polite response is, thank you for noticing.
__Bernadette Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.
__Howard Yeah, we could name him Blobert.
__Bernadette What if it's a girl?
__Howard Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.
__Bernadette Are we being silly not finding out the sex?
__Howard Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.
__Raj If you want, you can find out right now.
__Howard Mm.
__Bernadette Hmm. The doctor's gone for the day, so it doesn't matter.
__Raj Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.
__Bernadette You looked in our folder?!
__Raj It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It's not my fault I opened it and looked.
__Howard So you know the sex of our baby, and we don't?
__Raj Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
__Howard It's unbelievable.
__Bernadette God, Raj.
__Raj What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don't want to know, I don't have to tell you.
__Bernadette We don't want you to know.
__Raj Okay, well, that's a problem.
__Sheldon Oh. Thank you.
__Penny Mm.
__Sheldon Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it'd be such a party, we'd never get anything done.
__Penny That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?
__Sheldon Well, you've lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?
__Penny Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.
__Sheldon You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.
__Leonard I'm trying to think of an answer that won't stop you from doing this.
__ Cutting between Penny's apartment and Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
__ I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key.
__Leonard Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.
__Penny Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.
__Leonard Keep M&M'S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
__Penny You're gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other's personal space.
__Leonard He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.
__Amy I don't know. I didn't count.
__Sheldon You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
__Amy That's me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?
__Sheldon Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.
__Amy Well, if you're nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.
__Sheldon Okay. Talk.
__Amy Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.
__Sheldon Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.
__Amy Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don't we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we're more settled in, we can revisit it.
__Sheldon You're really okay with that?
__Amy I've never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.
__Sheldon This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn't get you all worked up, I'd kiss you right now.
__Amy Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.
__Sheldon I know. They probably shouldn't sell those to children.
__Amy Thank you.
__Sheldon Enjoy having the place to yourselves.
__Leonard You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
__Sheldon It's Penny's bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.
__Penny Now, now, there's no need to make this emotional.
__Amy Shall we?
__Sheldon I guess this is it.
__Leonard You guys have fun.
__Sheldon You, too. Oh, don't forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.
__Penny Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.
__Sheldon Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.
__Leonard I'm on it. 15 years from now, we'll make guacamole together.
__Sheldon Leonard, please, let me go.
__Amy Come on, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh. Bye.
__Leonard Good night.
__Penny Good night.
__Amy Well, that's it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.
__Sheldon I guess the experiment begins.
__Penny Wa-how, we did it.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Amy Doesn't matter to me. Your choice.
__Sheldon No, no, we're living together now, everything's equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.
__Amy Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.
__Sheldon Well, clearly, it's not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.
__Amy Well, I'm not refusing. I'm just trying to be considerate.
__Sheldon Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?
__Amy Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?
__Sheldon Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.
__Amy Great. That's your side.
__Sheldon No, but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack.
__Amy Okay, I'll take that side.
__Sheldon Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?
__Amy Rising rapidly.
__Sheldon Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.
__Amy Okay. What if we do this?
__Sheldon I suppose that works.
__Amy Great.
__Sheldon Although now I'm kind of worried someone's hiding behind those drapes.
__Howard I don't know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?
__Bernadette I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
__Howard But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It'll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.
__Bernadette Everyone said I could do better.
__Howard But you didn't listen, and presto change-o, my baby's inside you. Ta-da.
__Sheldon Be grateful I'm still in the room.
__Amy Comfy?
__Sheldon Oh, I'm just happy I don't know what this memory foam remembers.
__Amy Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.
__Sheldon Well, it's funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you'd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.
__Amy Sheldon, I've made more than enough accommodations for you. We're both grown adults, we've been far more intimate than this. If you don't want to snuggle, fine, but we're not building a pillow wall.
__Sheldon Okay, well, I am sorry. I'm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I'm surprised there aren't iguanas lying on it.
__Penny Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
__Leonard It's weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it's different.
__Penny So, what do you want to do?
__Leonard I know exactly what we are gonna do.
__Penny Really? You're a genius, and that's the first thing you come up with?
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon's not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.
__Penny Ugh. Can we just have sex?
__Leonard Oh, don't worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.
__Penny Inevitable, you say?
__Leonard I'll just let my hips do the talkin'.
__Bernadette Good. Call him. Wait, I'm not sure I want to know.
__Howard But you just said you wanted to know.
__Bernadette Well, now I don't know if I want to know!
__Raj Hello?
__Howard Call you back.
__Leonard The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.
__Bernadette Yes.
__Howard Okay. Here we go. It's ringing.
__Raj Hello?
__Howard Wrong number.
__Leonard You were right.
__Bernadette I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.
__Sheldon What are you doing down there?
__Amy Hang on.
__Sheldon Who are you calling? Aaargh!
__Penny Yeah, get it, girl.
__Amy It's not what you think.
__Leonard I feel like I pulled something. Why didn't you tell me to stop?
__Penny Even more not what you think.
__Amy I don't know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.
__Leonard If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Good morning. See? I didn't knock, but it's fine. I didn't knock, but it's fine. I didn't knock, but it's fine. So, how is everyone?
__Amy Miserable and exhausted.
__Sheldon Really? I slept great.
__Amy Well, I didn't, and it's your fault.
__Sheldon How? You had the whole floor to yourself.
__Amy Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.
__Sheldon Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?
__Amy The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
__Sheldon Wow. I anticipated we'd have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.
__Amy I'm sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?
__Sheldon If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
__Penny Was that a science diss?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny Was it a good one?
__Leonard Eh.
__Amy What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn't know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don't even get that joke, 'cause you don't even work with confounding variables.
__Sheldon How dare you?
__Amy Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.
__Sheldon Whoa, whoa! Now you're making fun of my bona fides?
__Penny I feel like I should say damn.
__Leonard Do it.
__Penny Damn.
__Sheldon Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.
__Amy Well, for science, maybe I will.
__Sheldon For science, maybe you should.
__Amy Fine.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Amy Good.
__Sheldon Great.
__Amy Do you want to go to our place and make out?
__Sheldon Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
__Penny The new neighbours are weird.
__Leonard I'll give you a hint. We're watching Daredevil.
__Sheldon Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
__Penny Can't.
__Leonard Won't.
__Penny Didn't.
__Leonard Don't.
__Amy I told you, you can't regulate every aspect of our lives.
__Sheldon I can if you'd just roll over and accept your fate.
__Amy I'm sorry for bringing this over here.
__Penny Believe me, we know what you're going through.
__Leonard And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Amy Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I'm willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise.
__Penny She's right. That's reasonable.
__Sheldon Oh, look who's in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.
__Leonard Hey, she didn't compromise. She settled. There's a difference.
__Penny Yeah. You tell him, babe.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard As soon as I get home. We're hoping to make it before dark.
__Raj I've never been to Palm Springs.
__Stuart Oh, you should go. It's terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.
__Stuart It's nice you and Bernadette are getting away.
__Howard Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.
__Stuart So then what are you doing here buying comic books?
__Howard Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.
__Sheldon Well I'm open to that.
__Amy Okay. Well, for starters, there's nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.
__Penny Sheldon, what do you say to that?
__Sheldon I think we should see other people.
__Amy What?
__Sheldon Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.
__Amy We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?
__Sheldon Don't blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He's the pervert pulling the strings here.
__Amy You wanna see other people? Go see other people.
__Penny I hope one of those people is a monkey, 'cause this is bananas.
__Leonard Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he's gonna move back in here.
__Penny All right. Well, let's just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.
__Leonard Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we'll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.
__Penny So it's okay for you to joke around?
__Leonard No, that's actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.
__Bernadette The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.
__Howard There she is. Who's ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?
__Bernadette Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
__Howard I'm sorry. We don't have to go.
__Bernadette But it's our last chance to take a vacation that's just the two of us.
__Howard How 'bout we stay here? We don't even have to tell anyone. It'll be like a secret vacation at home.
__Bernadette Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun.
__Howard Does it sound sexy?
__Bernadette You just heard me throwing up.
__Howard You bet I did.
__Bernadette You're so weird.
__Howard You know what's weird? How turned on you are right now.
__Penny Just as challenging?
__Penny As you?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Just as challenging as you?
__ and headed for the storm cellar.
__ Leonard breathes on me, too. It's not a big deal.
__Sheldon She's always complaining about people at work.
__Penny Well, so does Leonard. It's kind of annoying, but it's not the end of the world.
__Sheldon Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I'm a piece of meat?
__Penny You know, so does Leonard. Can't I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.
__Sheldon I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
__Penny Agreed. Thank you.
__Bernadette Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?
__Bernadette Lock the door, lock the door.
__Howard We should call the police.
__Bernadette Uh, I left my phone downstairs.
__Howard Damn, so did I.
__Bernadette Wait, I have my iPad.
__Howard What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?
__Bernadette That's not helpful.
__Howard You know I rely on humour in times of stress.
__Bernadette Let me know when you start, because that wasn't funny.
__Bernadette Who would use our hot tub?
__Howard Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.
__Howard Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?
__Bernadette Should we say something to him?
__Howard Maybe. How 'bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?
__Howard Nah, that's not gonna hurt his feelings.
__Leonard Look, here's the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He's the worst.
__Amy I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.
__Leonard I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.
__Amy I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.
__Leonard Don't beat yourself up. You've never lived with anyone before.
__Amy That's true.
__Leonard And you're starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That's like getting your first pet and having it be, I don't know, what's a kind of pet that ruins your life?
__Amy You're not making me feel better.
__Leonard Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier.
__Amy He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy's hair on the soap.
__Leonard Yeah. My record was six.
__Howard Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?
__Bernadette Is someone else here?
__Raj Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
__Stuart What are you doing here?
__Raj Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.
__Stuart Did they?
__Raj Answer the question, what are you doing here?
__Stuart I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they're not home.
__Bernadette What?
__Stuart They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon.
__Sheldon Have you noticed it's always an A-flat?
__Sheldon If we're just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.
__Penny Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.
__Sheldon Well, see, why can't Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she's Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.
__Penny Oh, please, you're barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?
__Sheldon Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy.
__Penny You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it's fine.
__Stuart Thank you.
__Raj Shall we toast?
__Stuart To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.
__Bernadette You said you got it back.
__Howard Well, clearly, I lied.
__Raj So how's your apartment?
__Stuart Not great. The electricity's out.
__Raj So why don't you get it fixed?
__Stuart I called, and they're like, pay your bill.
__Raj If you ever need somewhere to crash, there's always my place.
__Stuart Oh, no. I don't want to be an inconvenience. You've got all your lady friends, and…
__Raj Actually, I'm single now.
__Stuart What? When did that happen?
__Raj It's okay. It's by choice. Well, their choice, and it's not okay.
__Stuart Oh. Sorry. I didn't know.
__Raj Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn't say anything.
__Bernadette Why wouldn't he tell us? Are we bad friends?
__Howard He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.
__Bernadette Yeah, he deserves to be alone.
__Stuart So you're back out on the dating scene now?
__Raj Yeah, yeah, a little.
__Stuart Oh, that must be fun. How's that going?
__Raj I'm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.
__Leonard No, don't do that.
__Amy But you did.
__Amy It's just so much easier to give him what he wants.
__Leonard Oh, true, but think of how much you've accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?
__Amy Me.
__Leonard And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
__Amy Me. It was mittens.
__Leonard And who got him to try a turkey dog?
__Amy That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.
__Leonard How can you stop now? That's like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
__Amy You know, you're right. I'm in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself.
__Leonard Of course you do.
__Amy And if he doesn't like it, he can move back here.
__Leonard Oh. He can try. He'd just need a good locksmith.
__Sheldon No. No, if we both like it, I'll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.
__Penny What about the girl behind the counter?
__Sheldon Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm's probably bigger than the other.
__Penny Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
__Sheldon You are truly wise.
__Sheldon I'd say wise beyond your years, but you're getting up there.
__Penny All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?
__Sheldon Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I've never told anyone.
__Penny All right.
__Sheldon I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.
__Penny Not relating. Go on.
__Sheldon I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
__Penny Oh, now I'm with ya. Okay.
__Sheldon My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents' bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.
__Penny Oh, that's awful.
__Sheldon I know. It's also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first
__ one's traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on.
__ Well, what happened with your dad?
__Sheldon We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.
__Penny You poor thing.
__Sheldon Since Amy and I have been living together, we've been bickering like my parents used to.
__Penny And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?
__Sheldon Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
__Penny Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.
__Sheldon Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.
__Penny Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you're causing her right now?
__Sheldon I'm sure you're right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.
__Penny Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.
__Stuart I don't know. Bernadette's baby doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.
__Bernadette What do you do in there?
__Howard It's called relaxing, and that's all you need to know.
__Raj Well, it's getting late. Maybe we should head home.
__Stuart Yeah, you're probably right.
__Raj You coming?
__Stuart Yeah, just give me a minute.
__Raj Why?
__Stuart Well, you know how you're wearing a bathing suit?
__Raj Yeah?
__Stuart I kind of went the other way.
__Howard You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
__Amy It's a nice enough spot. You know, if I'm going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…
__Penny We're back.
__Amy Oh, hi. Hi.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard How you guys doing?
__Penny We're doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
__Sheldon I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.
__Amy Oh. Really?
__Leonard Why does she get that? We never got that.
__Penny Do you want him back?
__Leonard I'm very happy for you.
__Sheldon Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I'm willing to take our relationship to the next level.
__Amy I would love to.
__Leonard Did we really need to be here for this?
__Penny Call me crazy, but I found it moving.
__Leonard ‭Yeah. It's a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?
__Penny I got asked to sign autographs there.
__Leonard That's awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?
__Penny Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.
__Leonard When is it?
__Penny It doesn't matter. I'm not doing it.
__Leonard What? Why not?
__Penny You just said yourself, it's sad.
__Leonard Yeah, but it's not pathetic, that's where I draw the line. Come on, we'll have fun.
__Penny I don't know.
__Leonard You'll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don't love that, this marriage is in trouble.
__Penny I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
__Penny Oh, yeah.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.
__Amy You know what I meant.
__Sheldon All right, fine. Let's say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it's not a West Coast party, 'cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don't stop.
__Amy I'm sorry I mentioned it.
__Sheldon Oh, don't be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That's called teamwork.
__Bernadette What are you doing?
__Howard I felt a kick. There's a baby in there.
__Bernadette Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.
__Howard Oh, I mean, I know you're pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.
__Bernadette Which MIT did you go to?
__Howard Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don't have a crib, we don't have diapers, we're not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!
__Bernadette Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.
__Howard Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
__Bernadette The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.
__Howard Are we even in a good school…? Ow!
__Bernadette I warned you, and I did it.
__Leonard Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.
__Penny Okay. Leonard, it's sweet you're excited about this, but it'll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.
__Leonard Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler's signature.
__Penny Who's that?
__Leonard Oh, I don't even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?
__Penny Oh, there's so much I want to change.
__Leonard Yeah, well, if it's a dollar, you're in luck.
__Sheldon You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.
__Amy Well, that's so nice. Who's coming?
__Sheldon Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
__Sheldon Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.
__Amy That's an odd mix of people.
__Sheldon Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.
__Sheldon You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
__Amy Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I'm great at surprises.
__Amy Well, that's not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have
__ expected the surprise, and therefore not have been surprised, but as it is, I didn't know, and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising.
__ Don't get me all randy. Guests are on the way.
__Bernadette Hey, where you been?
__Howard Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.
__Raj Wait till you see the crib we found.
__Bernadette You bought a crib without me?
__Howard You're gonna love it.
__Raj Yeah, it's the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn't even call it a crib, I'd call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.
__Bernadette Sounds expensive.
__Howard Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can't put a price on safety.
__Raj Though if you did, it's more zeroes than you're expecting.
__Bernadette Fine.
__Howard In our new minivan. Hey, what's for lunch?
__Bernadette You bought a minivan?
__Howard It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.
__Raj Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.
__Bernadette I don't want to drive that. It's such a mom car.
__Howard The guy at the dealership said they're not just for moms anymore.
__Raj Then again, he did think you were my husband.
__Bernadette They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?
__Penny Really? I feel like I'm selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
__Leonard Okay, so it's four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour.
__Penny Alright, why not five and ten bucks?
__Leonard Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.
__Penny Hey, that guy's looking over here.
__Leonard Oh. You think he's your first autograph?
__Penny I don't know. Be cool. He's coming. He's coming. Hi.
__Guy Hi. I love your movie.
__Penny Well, thanks.
__Guy It has got to be one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.
__Penny Your love confuses me.
__Leonard Would you like an autograph?
__Guy Sure.
__Guy Daniel.
__Penny Okay.
__Daniel I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?
__Penny That did not clear things up.
__Leonard That'll be four seventy-five.
__Daniel Keep the change.
__Leonard But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good.
__Sheldon The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.
__Amy Been 15 minutes. Just sayin'.
__Sheldon Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.
__Bert I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.
__Amy How old was it
__Bert It's hard to say. I don't remember much after I drank it.
__Sheldon Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?
__Mrs Petrescu Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee's.
__Mrs Petrescu TV, good. Now back to you.
__Stuart Hey, guys.
__Amy Hi, Stuart.
__Stuart These are for you.
__Amy Oh, they're pretty. Thank you.
__Sheldon Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
__Stuart Nice to meet you.
__Mrs Petrescu Hello.
__Bert Hey.
__Stuart So, what did I miss?
__Bert Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.
__Mrs Petrescu 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.
__Stuart Anybody else coming to this thing?
__Jeff Jeff.
__Penny Okay.
__Jeff My favourite part is your shower scene.
__Penny Been hearing that a lot today.
__Jeff I even have a screen grab on my phone.
__Penny Yep, there they are.
__Leonard Okay, let's keep it moving.
__Penny Here you go.
__Leonard Should've punched that guy.
__Penny Well, go ahead. He's right over there.
__Leonard Why do you do that? Can't you let me have my moment?
__Penny Hello.
__Awkward guy Hi. I like your movies.
__Penny Thank you.
__Awkward guy I saw both of them.
__Penny I assume we're still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.
__Awkward guy You think I could get a picture of us?
__Penny Oh, sure.
__Awkward guy And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?
__Leonard No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
__Penny Leonard…
__Leonard No, no, no. It's not okay.
__Awkward guy Who are you?
__Leonard I'm her husband.
__Awkward guy No, you're not.
__Leonard I am.
__Penny Yeah, he really is.
__Awkward guy No.
__Raj Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.
__Howard Imagine this, you've got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you're thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?
__Bernadette I'm probably thinking, where's my husband, and why isn't he helping me?
__Howard You don't need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
__Raj No, it's a gentle kick, you're doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.
__Howard Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?
__Bernadette It's weird that guy thought you were a couple.
__Howard Yes.
__Raj Yes.
__Howard See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we'll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I'm telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.
__Bernadette Oh, is it your back?
__Howard Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let's just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.
__Bert I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.
__Amy Things didn't work out?
__Bert I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I'm warning you, hide your good rocks.
__Mrs Petrescu My sister's husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven.
__Stuart Really, no one else is coming?
__Sheldon This is it. You are the practice round.
__Stuart Practice round? For-for what?
__Amy Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.
__Sheldon You know, exactly. We've never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.
__Stuart So, I'm like a lab rat before your real friends come over?
__Sheldon Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine.
__Amy Stuart, you know you're one of our favourite people.
__Sheldon Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I'm glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.
__Leonard Well, she moved in across the hall.
__Penny And he started to slowly wear me down.
__Leonard Like a river carves a canyon.
__Penny Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.
__Red-haired guy Red- Ready to go?
__Awkward guy Hang on. This guy's telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.
__Red-haired guy Red- This guy? But he's wearing a change maker.
__Penny I think it's hot.
__Leonard That's right. I'm her change daddy.
__Bernadette Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They're just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.
__Howard You're gonna feel terrible when I'm in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.
__Bernadette Fine, we'll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.
__Howard You're right. It sells itself.
__Raj You have to admit, it's a pretty smooth ride.
__Howard If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?
__Bernadette Soon.
__Howard Why is it taking so long?
__Raj The Animated Series. Your favourite.
__Howard I'm in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one.
__Bernadette Fine. I'll buy the stupid van.
__Sheldon Oh. Thank you.
__Bert It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.
__Stuart You know what, I, I, I think I'm just gonna go.
__Amy No, Stuart, don't.
__Stuart No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I'm not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?
__Amy We're so sorry.
__Stuart I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.
__Sheldon Well, no, that's not true. I mean, sometimes it's Koothrappali. But we're not supposed to say that 'cause he's a minority.
__Stuart Bye.
__Sheldon Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.
__Bert I know how it feels, too.
__Sheldon All right, this is about me and him, you're not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.
__Stuart Thank you.
__Sheldon You know, in fact, I'd like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.
__Bert Hear, hear.
__Amy Cheers.
__Mrs Petrescu Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.
__Awkward guy Oh. Whoa. I didn't know you can propose to the same person so many times.
__Leonard The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.
__Penny You know, once, I proposed to him.
__Leonard Yeah. I said no.
__Red-haired guy Red- Why?
__Leonard I just wanted to make her work for it.
__Penny Yeah, that's gonna cost you later.
__Red-haired guy Red- Hang on. Is she just with you because you're rich?
__Leonard She makes more money than I do.
__Awkward guy What? Who are you?
__Stuart Hmm?
__Sheldon Your handwriting is impeccable.
__Stuart Thank you for noticing.
__Sheldon No, I mean it. I mean it. It's like you have the soul of a label maker.
__Stuart You know what I love about you?
__Sheldon Hmm?
__Stuart You never leave the house without a paper clip.
__Sheldon You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
__Stuart I also love how you never use swear words.
__Sheldon You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without 'em.
__Amy Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
__Sheldon Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.
__Amy And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Sheldon And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
__Both Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags.
__Sheldon Hit it.
__Howard For joy and fun there's no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
__Raj What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist.
__Together Fun with flags, fun with flags.
__Howard Oh say can you see, it's fun with flags.
__Together Fun with flags.
__Amy As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.
__Amy We're also coming to you live from a different apartment.
__Sheldon Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny's place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don't Understand Them.
__Amy So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today's episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.
__Sheldon So, let's roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis.  Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me.
__ Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…
__Penny I can't believe I'm saying this, but can we watch the news or something?
__Leonard It's cute, they're having fun living together.
__Penny Yeah, I wonder what they're gonna do when her apartment's ready.
__Bernadette Actually, it's been ready for weeks.
__Leonard What do you mean?
__Bernadette Well, they finished the work early, but she's been telling Sheldon they're behind schedule.
__Leonard So, she's just been lying to him?
__Penny Well, you've lied to Sheldon.
__Leonard Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.
__Sheldon Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that's why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.
__Howard Oh, right.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Aw, you think you have an audience, that's funny.
__Amy It's almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
__Sheldon Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.
__Amy Oh, you don't want do that, it's a construction zone.
__Sheldon So?
__Amy Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?
__Sheldon I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
__Amy Anyway, how about dinner?
__Sheldon You know, if you'd like, I could call your landlord and complain.
__Amy Thanks, but you don't have to.
__Sheldon Oh, I don't mind, I'm very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I'd complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I'd take home the gold.
__Amy Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?
__Sheldon Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?
__Amy No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?
__Sheldon I have a feeling you're still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.
__Leonard So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
__Raj If we're all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?
__Leonard You're awful quiet, everything okay?
__Sheldon I'm concerned about Amy. She's acting a bit odd lately.
__Howard Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?
__Sheldon Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she's hiding something.
__Leonard I wouldn't worry about it. She's probably just distracted by work.
__Sheldon Well, whatever it is, it's troubling me. And I can't eat, I can't sleep. And don't even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.
__Howard You heard him, guys, don't ask.
__Sheldon Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.
__Leonard Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn't want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.
__Sheldon I don't understand.
__Leonard She's enjoying living with you and she didn't want it to end early.
__Sheldon So, she's deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.
__Raj Oh my God, that's who you look like.
__Leonard Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It's a little white lie, everyone does it.
__Raj Not me, I'm a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.
__Howard And how single are you right now?
__Raj Eating cake on the toilet single.
__Sheldon Well, I won't tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.
__Howard Don't do that, you've got gold here. Hang onto it until you're in trouble and then throw it in her face.
__Leonard Why would you tell him that? That's terrible advice.
__Howard So you wouldn't want to have anything on Penny?
__Leonard Well, of course not.
__Howard So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don't want me to tell you?
__Leonard Uh, no.
__Howard I'll take that as a yes. She's secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven't noticed.
__Howard See, I've known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.
__Sheldon Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar's gone.
__Leonard I'd say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn't until next month.
__Sheldon It's khoo-vakh.
__Leonard Khoo-vakh! She took my Where's Waldo.
__Sheldon No, no, he's over there.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, there he is.
__Amy Um, it was a drywall problem.
__Penny Oh, no, what happened?
__Amy Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it's really more…
__Penny Wet wall?
__Amy Or damp wall, just as bad.
__Penny Mm. So why don't they just get more drywall?
__Amy Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…
__Penny Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment's ready.
__Amy I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn't let it go.
__Penny But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
__Amy Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don't say anything, I feel terrible about this.
__Penny Oh, don't worry, I won't.
__Amy Thanks.
__Penny The woman at the wall store?
__Amy Let it go.
__Leonard Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.
__Sheldon Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they're willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.
__Leonard Oh, my God, I'm going blind.
__Penny Hi.
__Amy Food's here.
__Sheldon Excellent. I'm very hungry. Speaking of which, what's going on with your apartment?
__Amy Oh, uh, they're still working on it.
__Sheldon Interesting. Very interesting.
__Penny Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they're gonna be fixing it for a while.
__Sheldon Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?
__Penny I did, still a mess.
__Sheldon Leonard?
__ s
__ Yeah?
__Sheldon jlyajbe'. DaH nep'a' Penny? (I don't understand, is Penny lying?)
__Leonard jISovbe' (I don't know.)
__Amy Why are you speaking Klingon?
__Sheldon Why are you speaking English?
__Amy This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?
__Penny Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
__Amy Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi'm lubyubing?
__Penny Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit's pubossubibuble.
__Sheldon Oh, wait, stop that.
__Amy You stop that.
__Sheldon Dayaj'a' (Do you understand them?)
__Leonard ghobe'
__Sheldon Qu'vatlh
__Penny Okay. That's enough. You know what? What is going on?
__Leonard Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment's been finished, but then you just said it's not, so now I'm all confused.
__Amy Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
__Sheldon How could you lie to me?
__Penny Uh, she's enjoyed living with you. It's called being in love.
__Leonard Mm-hmm, and what's it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband's stuff?
__Penny What? Tha… That is not true.
__Leonard Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.
__Penny Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend's wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.
__Leonard You really didn't think I'd notice my stuff was missing?
__Penny Uh, did you notice your key chain?
__Leonard Where's Batman?
__Bernadette Hey.
__Penny Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard's things?
__Bernadette One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
__Howard It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv (Who knows the status of Amy's apartment?)
__Amy Everybody stop it with that.
__Raj I'm not really a part of this, so I'm just gonna dig in.
__Amy And I'd like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
__Howard You're up, blabby.
__Bernadette Amy, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.
__Amy I guess it's okay. I'm sorry that I lied about my apartment.
__Sheldon It's all right.
__Leonard And?
__Penny And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
__Raj Now that everything's out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?
__Sheldon Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.
__Amy Are you saying you'd like to live with me?
__Sheldon I'm open to the possibility.
__Penny Ubamy bube cubool.
__Amy Whatever.
__Howard You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don't like in Sheldon's old room. Solves everything.
__Penny That's a great idea.
__Leonard Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.
__Raj That would be amazing.
__Sheldon Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that's my room.
__Leonard But you won't be living here.
__Sheldon But that's my room.
__Leonard But you won't be living here.
__Sheldon But that's my room.
__Leonard You guys might want to start eating. But you won't be living here.
__Penny Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.
__Sheldon But that's my room.
__Everyone But you won't be living here.
__Sheldon Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I'm like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.
__Amy Good night.
__Sheldon Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?
__Amy I don't know. It, it could be.
__Sheldon Of course there's, there's always your apartment.
__Amy Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.
__Sheldon I hate your apartment.
__Amy Sorry, you brought it up?
__Sheldon Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don't even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn't even end in dena.
__Amy It's kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
__Sheldon But what if we move and we don't like it? What if there's a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I'm gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
__Amy Yes.
__Sheldon I'm not a child, don't do that.
__Amy Sorry.
__Sheldon Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now that's soothing.
__Penny Thank you.
__Leonard Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
__Penny Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.
__Leonard I'm kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.
__Penny Do you really mean that?
__Leonard I really do.
__Penny Great, and just so you know, I'm not getting rid of all your stuff.
__Penny That candle and you.
__Leonard What about my robot poster?
__Penny Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.
__Sheldon I'm struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
__Amy Can it be more of an internal struggle?
__Sheldon I need to see it. While I'm gone, don't breathe on my pillow.
__Amy How about if I just don't breathe at all?
__Sheldon That's my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
__Leonard Oh, hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon No.
__Amy What is happening?
__Sheldon Can we just focus on the decision I'm facing?
__Raj We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?
__Leonard Over my assless chaps you will.
__Howard This isn't complicated. Do you love Amy?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj Do you like living with her?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Do you know what you need to do now?
__Sheldon Apparently, figure this out on my own 'cause you guys are no help at all.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Amy What are you doing?
__Sheldon I'm just contemplating Buridan's donkey.
__Amy I understand. I'll leave you be.
__Sheldon What, you're familiar with the reference?
__Amy Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
__Sheldon Exactly.
__Amy Well, I wouldn't want you to starve to death, so here's an eggplant.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Amy You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.
__Sheldon Really?
__Amy Although, in Aristotle's example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.
__Sheldon Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that's related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.
__Amy Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.
__Leonard Wow.
__Penny I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
__Leonard No, no, no, no, no, it's, it's important to me that you have the bedroom you want.
__Penny Oh, that means so much. I love you.
__Leonard I love you, too.
__Amy It's just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.
__Sheldon On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.
__Amy A two.
__Sheldon Eating a whole Altoid?
__Amy Sheldon, if I'm gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I've done this dozens of times, but if you're too scared you don't have to.
__Sheldon No, this is for science. I can be brave for science.
__Amy Thank you.
__Sheldon Oh, jiminy, that's cold.
__Amy Just think how happy you'll be in a few weeks when I've converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
__Sheldon All right, just warn me before you do it.
__Amy Okay. Three, two, and we're done.
__Sheldon You tricked me. You didn't say one.
__Amy It didn't hurt, did it?
__Sheldon No, but three, two and we're done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It's like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…
__Amy Okay, fine, one.
__Sheldon Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.
__ Credits sequence.
__Cleaner Uh, sorry, I could come back.
__Raj Oh, no, it's okay. I just found a wobble.
__Cleaner Oh, do I need a mop?
__Raj It's a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
__Cleaner Oh, well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?
__Raj Yeah, but it's probably difficult to pronounce.
__Cleaner What is your name?
__ Raj; Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
__ You think it would be more difficult than that?
__Raj Good point. And you are?
__Cleaner Oh, uh, Isabella Maria Concepcion.
__Raj Oh, well, nice to meet you.
__Isabella Nice to meet you, too. You know, I have to say, based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food I see in this trash, working here was ten years old.
__Raj Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.
__Raj Oh, please, allow me. That's a lot of empty calories.
__Isabella Thank you.
__Raj You're welcome.
__Isabella Okay, uh, okay, I have to go.
__Raj Okay.
__Isabella Good luck with your, um, space exploration.
__Raj Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.
__Amy If you'd give me a minute, I'll tell you.
__Sheldon Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they're so thick and beautiful.
__Amy Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.
__Sheldon I have such a profound sense of creation. I, it's like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys.
__Amy These cells come from both of us.
__Sheldon Yeah, but us monkeys doesn't pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?
__Amy No reason we can't start right now.
__Sheldon What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let's
__ Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it's remarkable, but it's still limited in what it can do.
__Sheldon I understand. She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.
__Raj Oh, no, that's mine.
__Leonard Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.
__Raj Well, I can't eat like a ten-year-old all the time.
__Penny You're dating somebody, who is it?
__Howard No, she's right. As long as I've known you, you've always been self-conscious about your cleavage.
__Raj That's because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
__Penny All right, fine, don't tell us.
__Raj There's nothing to tell.
__Leonard How's that broccoli?
__Raj It's gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.
__Penny Bam. Thank you. What's her name?
__Raj Isabella.
__Howard Oh, did you meet her at work?
__Raj Yes, in the telescope room.
__Raj Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes, this is all making sense. Good.
__Penny Well, that's great, Raj. You must have so much in common.
__Raj Mm-hmm.
__Howard So, when do we meet her?
__Raj No, no, this is brand new. We haven't even been on a proper date yet.
__Leonard Okay, well, good luck with it.
__Raj Thank you.
__Penny How come you never eat broccoli?
__Leonard I'm married, I don't have to be attractive.
__Bernadette Still, I can't believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.
__Amy Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky's the limit.
__Sheldon Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.
__Bernadette Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it's you.
__Sheldon Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy's lab.
__Bernadette I'm running out of ways to act excited.
__Amy So, enough about us, how are things going with you?
__Bernadette Great, the doctor said the baby's head is facing down now.
__Amy Good, you know, in case the exit isn't clearly marked.
__Sheldon Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who's on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.
__Bernadette Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
__Sheldon Well, I didn't make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.
__Bernadette You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
__Sheldon Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.
__Bernadette Mine has a fully developed immune system.
__Sheldon Ours doesn't need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.
__Amy Sheldon, that's enough.
__Sheldon Okay, fine. Let's just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn't need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win.
__Isabella You're kidding.
__Raj No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.
__Isabella It's okay, you're allowed to have a cleaning lady.
__Raj Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair.
__Isabella I think that's called a mommy.
__Raj Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?
__Isabella No, not for many years.
__Raj Oh, so, you are unencumbered?
__Isabella Just me and my son.
__Raj I love kids, how old is he?
__Isabella Nineteen.
__Raj That's a cute age. They can do so many things.
__Isabella He's studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.
__Raj That's wonderful. A lawyer, my sister's a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common.
__Isabella Yeah, I guess we do.
__Raj Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?
__Isabella Ay, Rajesh, I think you're very sweet, but I work two jobs and I don't have time for dating.
__Raj Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I'm very busy, too.
__Isabella Oh, please don't take it personal, I think you're a very nice man.
__Raj I think you're very nice as well.
__Isabella Thank you for helping me. Good night, Rajesh.
__Raj Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I don't know, maybe it's the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us.
__Isabella Good night, Rajesh.
__Raj Okay. I'll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I'll be thinking of you.
__Amy I've never seen results like this before.
__Sheldon Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge.
__Amy Aren't you glad you participated in this?
__Sheldon Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?
__Amy Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
__Sheldon Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.
__Amy Make a baby? What are you talking about?
__Sheldon Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We'll be able to get into any preschool we want!
__Amy Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.
__Sheldon Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you're as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.
__Amy Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.
__Sheldon I don't understand. I thought you'd be thrilled to procreate with me.
__Amy Not right now.
__Sheldon Oh, I see what's happening here. You're playing hard to get.
__Amy I'm not playing anything. We're not making a baby today.
__Sheldon Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?
__Isabella What is this?
__Raj Oh, well, you said you didn't have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here.
__Isabella Oh, Rajesh.
__Raj Oh, come on, we're in the telescope room. It'll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means it's twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while.
__Isabella Rajesh, this is so sweet, but you, you know I'm working.
__Raj That's why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
__Isabella Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.
__Raj Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.
__Raj That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?
__Amy No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.
__Leonard Why does he need a baby? He's already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
__Penny Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
__Amy Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn't guarantee anything.
__Leonard That's true. Sheldon's father once picked a fight with a cactus.
__Penny Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents. We don't know anything about the ones that sent him here.
__Leonard Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.
__Amy Hey, you're talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man.
__Penny Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some.
__Leonard Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's behind door number two.
__Sheldon Well, hello.
__Amy Hello.
__Sheldon Would you care for a brandy?
__Sheldon Good choice, it's disgusting.
__Amy Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.
__Sheldon Who's trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
__Amy I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
__Sheldon Anything you'd like to pet? Not my hair. There's a lot of goop in it.
__Amy Okay, I've had enough.
__Sheldon Amy, come back. I don't know how to open the oysters.
__Raj I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.
__Isabella You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you'd like to…
__Howard Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?
__Isabella It's okay. Uh, I should get back to work.
__Howard Hi. Howard Wolowitz.
__Isabella Oh. Isabella Concepcion.
__Howard Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper.
__Isabella You told him I was an astronomer?
__Raj Uh.
__Isabella I understand. Time to go.
__Raj No, p-please don't.
__Isabella It's okay, Rajesh, I'm a grown woman. I don't have to waste my time with someone who's embarrassed by me.
__Howard I can keep this, right?
__Raj I'm sorry. Honestly, I didn't think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there's a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.
__Isabella I doubt that.
__Raj Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they're pretty, but I'm scared of butterflies.
__Howard Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart.
__Raj Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
__Isabella You're very persistent.
__Raj It's my one move.
__Isabella Okay. This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant.
__Raj Great. Where would you like to go?
__Isabella Your choice. It can be Pakistani food if you like.
__Isabella And now you know how it feels.
__Amy It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.
__Leonard I'm sorry, is that a yes?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Amy, I didn't want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco.
__Amy For God's sake, you're ridiculous.
__Sheldon You guys are aroused, right?
__Amy That was a close one.
__Leonard That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.
__Howard Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.
__Raj Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
__Sheldon Everything is stupid and I want to go home.
__Leonard That's Sheldon's way of saying he's proud of Bert, too.
__Howard Ah.
__Sheldon Hey, it's not even called the Genius Grant, it's the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it's not Frankenstein, it's Frankenstein's Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone's a genius, it's me for the way I brought that full circle.
__Leonard How much money did he win?
__Raj Over half a million dollars.
__Leonard Wow.
__Howard And he doesn't have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.
__Sheldon Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.
__Howard Here he comes.
__Leonard Right. Be polite.
__Sheldon I know how to behave.
__Howard Do you?
__Leonard Yeah, good for you.
__Howard That's amazing.
__Bert Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn't believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.
__Bert I've gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.
__Leonard I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I've ever heard.
__Sheldon Well, aren't you a peach.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Ignore him, he's just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.
__Penny Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn't believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.
__Sheldon Who listens to the radio any more?
__Amy Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
__Leonard They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
__Penny You know what, I've met Bert. Isn't he an indicator of life on other planets?
__Sheldon You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.
__Amy You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert's research, you'd be less bitter about him winning.
__Sheldon You want me to read a geology paper?
__Amy Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I'm all out of taffy.
__Bernadette Who is it?
__Howard Say hello to everybody's little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking.
__Bernadette Where did you get that?
__Howard I found him in an old box.
__Bernadette Why would you buy it?
__Howard I didn't buy it. I made it.
__Bernadette Last question. What is wrong with you?
__Howard What's the big deal?
__Bernadette Howie, it's in poor taste.
__Howard No, it's not. Check it out, he says fun stuff.
__Remote-control Hawking Remote- Hey good lookin', want to go for a spin?
__Penny It's like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
__Sheldon Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that's why.
__Amy Sounds like the night we had coitus.
__Sheldon I hope you're happy making me read this. Bert's work is remarkable, and I'm more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer's actually entertaining.
__Amy Sheldon, it's foolish to be angry that Bert's work has merit.
__Sheldon Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?
__Penny Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Penny I, I knew the answer. I got excited.
__Leonard Hey, buddy, why don't we go for a walk, so you can calm down.
__Sheldon That's a good idea. I guess everyone's having them now.
__Leonard Hey, I'm trying to help you.
__Sheldon Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
__Leonard You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it's not…
__Raj This is tough, but I'm going to say it's the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.
__Howard You're crazy. I've worked with Hawking. He's got a great sense of humour, and I think he'd like it.
__Bernadette Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.
__Howard I have no problem calling him.
__Howard Fine, I will.
__Bernadette While you're bothering the world's most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.
__Raj What's this button do?
__Remote-control Hawking Remote- Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.
__Howard You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
__Raj I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
__Leonard Really, why?
__Sheldon You're happy with who you are. You don't get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.
__Leonard I couldn't just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you're feeling. My brother and sister's accomplishments have always been held over my head.
__Sheldon How did you deal with it?
__Leonard I wet the bed until college, but I don't think that's a quality fix.
__Sheldon I can't believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I'm having a primal urge to throw this rock.
__Leonard Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.
__Sheldon Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you're at it.
__Leonard Let it fly.
__Amy What happened?
__Sheldon I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
__Leonard Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
__Penny Well, and what happened to you?
__Leonard Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It's fine.
__Amy You know, it's one thing to be envious, but now you're injuring yourself. It has to stop.
__Leonard Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.
__Sheldon Yeah, but you've got all those things, and no one's lining up to be you.
__Amy Anybody else want to try? I'm gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
__Leonard You're up.
__Penny This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.
__Sheldon Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?
__Penny I do, your life is fine you big baby.
__Sheldon Maybe you're right.
__Amy Really?
__Sheldon Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert's success is not my failure.
__Penny There you go.
__Sheldon And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
__Penny There you go.
__Howard I'm conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
__Amy Yep.
__Leonard Does it spin around and do tricks?
__Howard Yeah
__Leonard Then yeah.
__Barry That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls' westwoom.
__Howard All right, we're done. It's offensive.
__Howard You're in a good mood.
__Sheldon Well, it's a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don't need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.
__Leonard Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?
__Raj Well, I'm glad to see you moving forward.
__Sheldon Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.
__Howard What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?
__Leonard I think he might be learning on his own.
__Raj Then the robot uprising has begun.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.
__Raj He doesn't just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.
__Sheldon Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.
__Bert Thanks. I've been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I'm great.
__Sheldon Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.
__Bert You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I'm allowed to nominate someone for next year.
__Sheldon Really? I didn't know that.
__Bert So I was thinking, you know, engineers don't get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?
__Sheldon You know, I'm not sure. You know, you'd have to ask him. Excuse me.  Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again.
__Leonard Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.
__Sheldon No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.
__Bernadette I can't imagine you being violent.
__Leonard It's not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.
__Sheldon I'm so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.
__Raj It's a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I'm jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.
__Amy What about me and Sheldon?
__Raj Sure.
__Leonard I've always been jealous of how much money Raj's family has.
__Raj Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.
__Amy Ever since I met Penny, I've been envious of her looks.
__Penny Aw, thank you.
__Amy That's why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.
__Penny What?
__Amy You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why'd that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot.
__Penny You liked my short hair, right?
__Leonard Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.
__Penny Seriously, none of you liked it?
__Bernadette I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?
__Penny You know, how come nobody's talking about Howard's dopey haircut?
__Bernadette I think he looks cute.
__Howard And I think you're cute.
__Raj I think you're both cute.
__Penny I think I hate all of you nerds.
__Leonard Oh, I don't mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I'm walking with my grandma.
__Sheldon Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.
__Leonard Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.
__Sheldon I can't take this any more.  Bert.  Bert.  Bert.
__Bert Come in.
__Sheldon All right, let's do this, Bert? We need to talk.
__Bert What happened to you?
__Sheldon Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.
__Bert Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone's jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I'll be out of things to wish for.
__Bert Is it working?
__Sheldon No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.
__Bert Well, you know, we're both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.
__Sheldon We, hang on, you're my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I'm my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I'm good to go.
__Bert Great. Now that we're friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?
__Sheldon You know what? This isn't gonna work.
__Bert Sheldon, wait. You know, you've got a lot to be happy about. You're at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.
__Sheldon Yes, that's right. I have Amy. In the past, you've professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don't?
__Bert It used to. But now that I'm rich and successful, I think I can do better.
__Sheldon I didn't punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I'm not even sure he knows I did it.
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, I've got someone here who might make you feel better.
__Stephen Hawking Hello, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Professor Hawking.
__Hawking I understand you're struggling with professional jealousy.
__Sheldon Thanks, Leonard, now he's not gonna think I'm cool.
__Hawking Don't worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.
__Penny Oh, wow, that doesn't seem fair.
__Hawking It's fine. I've been on The Simpsons.
__Sheldon How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
__Hawking I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.
__Leonard Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don't care.
__Hawking Don't waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, you're too brilliant.
__Amy How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you're brilliant?
__Sheldon I can't. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.
__Hawking I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.
__Sheldon What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?
__Leonard Do not tell Wolowitz.
__Amy Way ahead of you.
__Sheldon Do people know about her? ‘Cause she's delightful.
__Sheldon Oh, actually, I would.
__Amy Great, what'd you have in mind?
__Sheldon Let's take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
__Amy Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.
__Sheldon You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.
__Amy Look, we can't just throw away Penny's stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.
__Sheldon You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.
__Amy Well, I'm sure she misses this one. I mean, it's the greatest gift I've ever given anybody.
__Sheldon It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
__Amy It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
__Sheldon Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.
__Amy I can't wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.
__Sheldon What happened to them?
__Penny Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.
__Leonard Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that's here, cool.
__Penny Amy wants me to have it.
__Amy Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.
__Penny But it's a picture of you.
__Amy And you.
__Penny But you commissioned it.
__Amy To give to you.
__Penny But you like it so much.
__Amy So do you.
__Sheldon You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?
__Penny Why don't you keep it?
__Sheldon That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.
__Penny Yeah, I don't need anything around that I can stab myself with.
__Sheldon Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?
__Leonard Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.
__Sheldon Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.
__Leonard Fine, take the plant.
__Sheldon Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment's really shaping up.
__Stuart Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you're not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond.
__Bernadette A foot massage?
__Stuart And that's not me being creepy, that's for either of you.
__Howard This is very nice Stuart, thank you.
__Bernadette How come this one's on the back of an eviction notice?
__Stuart Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?
__Bernadette Stuart, we'd love to help you out, but this a bad time, we're about to have a baby.
__Stuart Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you're gonna need all the help you can get.
__Bernadette Thank you, but I'm not really sure.
__Howard Hang on, maybe it's not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.
__Stuart That woman didn't get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.
__Bernadette I guess you could stay for a few days and we'll see how it goes.
__Stuart Thank you. And it's only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.
__Howard When would you move in?
__Stuart Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I'm gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I'm gonna go vacuum.
__Bernadette Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.
__Stuart Okay, then I'll dust.
__Bernadette I did that, too.
__Stuart Then I'll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.
__Bernadette Howard just did that.
__Howard Yeah, let him do it.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.
__Mr Spock Cuckoo Clock Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.
__Sheldon It's one of a kind.
__Penny So if it breaks there'd be none of it?
__Sheldon Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.
__Leonard So you think you should keep it?
__Sheldon I'll be right across the hall. You'll probably be able to hear it.
__Leonard Keep the clock, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny Thank you.
__Amy Thank you?
__Sheldon Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?
__Leonard Let me guess, you want it.
__Sheldon Well, no, I just didn't think you'd want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.
__Leonard You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don't care.
__Sheldon Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
__Leonard Well, now they're yours.
__Penny Leonard.
__Leonard Well, you know what's gonna happen, he's just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.
__Sheldon For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?
__Amy Sheldon, you're, you're being a little selfish. Why don't you let Leonard keep a few things?
__Sheldon It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten.
__Leonard You know what? There is one thing I would like.
__Sheldon Yeah, take whatever you want.
__Leonard I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
__Sheldon But you don't even like flags.
__Leonard Yeah, I like this one.
__Sheldon But I designed it.
__Leonard But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they'd jack up the price.
__Sheldon But you don't even understand its symbolism.
__Leonard Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I'm happy about it.
__Sheldon Come along, Amy. I know when I'm not wanted.
__Amy I don't think you do, but all right.
__Howard How did you know it wasn't me?
__Bernadette There's only three people in this house, and you'd still be my fifth guess.
__Howard That's Raj.
__Stuart You guys relax, I'll get it. Have some bread while it's still warm.
__Howard It's like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I'd be Bruce Wayne.
__Bernadette You have a Batsuit.
__Howard It's pajamas, there's no cape.
__Stuart Hey, Raj.
__Raj Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?
__Stuart Oh, I'm living here again.
__Raj Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?
__Stuart No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.
__Raj Okay, cool.
__Stuart Anyway, come on in, dinner's ready.
__Raj Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.
__Stuart Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.
__Penny Uh, hang on. I don't think so, I'm clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I'm still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.
__Leonard Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.
__Penny Are you sure?
__Leonard Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I've got you, so it's either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.
__Penny What a jerk.
__Leonard You're good at revenge, how do we get him back?
__Penny Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person's boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I'm already doing that.
__Leonard Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.
__Sheldon Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm warning you, I can play this game, too.
__Sheldon If it's like your 3-D chess game, then you're out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.
__Leonard All right, I tried.
__Sheldon All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.
__Amy I've got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?
__Sheldon It's a good thing you're cute.
__Bernadette Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.
__Stuart Oh, I know a CPR instructor who'll come to the house.
__Howard That'd be great.
__Stuart I'll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.
__Bernadette Thank you again for cooking. It's getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
__Stuart You just kick back and relax, I've got it all under control.
__Raj Although it was already under control.
__Stuart I'm sorry, you mumbled something?
__Stuart Well, you know what they say, it takes a village.
__Raj Well, they already had a village.
__Stuart I noticed the village couldn't find time to put the crib together.
__Raj Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.
__Stuart You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We'll pass, thank you.
__Bernadette Do something, Batman.
__Sheldon What do you think you're doing?
__Leonard Separating my delicates.
__Sheldon This is the level you're stooping to.
__Leonard No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.
__Raj I'm here to put the crib together.
__Stuart Ooh, sorry, I already did it.
__Raj Well I don't know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.
__Stuart Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com
__Raj Why are you being like this?
__Stuart Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.
__Raj Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.
__Stuart Why can't there be four wheels?
__Raj Is this what you do when I'm not here, make really good points?
__Stuart Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.
__Raj Thank you.
__Stuart If you're hungry you can eat your take-out, nobody touched it.
__Leonard No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he's right behind you. Hello?
__Strange old man Hey, how you doing?
__Leonard Uh, can I help you?
__Strange old man I don't think so, but you're sweet for asking.
__Penny What, what are you doing in our apartment?
__Strange old man Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy.
__Leonard Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don't know what he told you, but you can't stay here.
__Sheldon So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you've met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They're very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.
__Leonard Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?
__Sheldon My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.
__Sheldon Anyway, I'll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he's expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.
__Penny All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.
__Sheldon That's true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen who can't produce a single form of ID.
__Theodore Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I'm O-negative.
__Sheldon And now you know as much about him as I do.
__Bernadette Great, go with the giraffes.
__Stuart Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.
__Bernadette Yeah, you're probably right, go with the zebras.
__Stuart Good choice, boss.
__Raj At least my nose is naturally brown.
__Bernadette Hey, could you please go to the market for me?
__Howard Get Stuart or Raj to do it.
__Bernadette Howie, they've been doing everything for you.
__Howard Mm, I know. It's really making me lose respect for both of them.
__Bernadette Please just go to the store.
__Howard Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?
__Raj Me
__Stuart I'll do it.
__Bernadette Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
__Leonard And just leave him here alone?
__Penny Okay, I'll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you're still alive.
__Leonard Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?
__Theodore Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.
__Leonard This is ridiculous.
__Theodore I like the painting. Is that your mom?
__Leonard Sheldon, get out here.
__Leonard We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
__Sheldon I'm being awful? You're the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
__Leonard Because you were being selfish.
__Sheldon Dividing our belongings is difficult.
__Leonard Why? I said I didn't care.
__Theodore Excuse me. It's none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.
__Leonard Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.
__Theodore Well, I'm just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you're in a new phase of your lives and it's easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.
__Amy I think he might be right. Also, who is that?
__Leonard Well, for me, too. It's not the same with you gone.
__Theodore If you're looking for a new guy to live with.
__Leonard No.
__Penny We're good, thank you.
__Amy So, no one's gonna tell me? Okay.
__Sheldon In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals.
__Leonard You promise?
__Sheldon I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.
__Theodore Well if we're rubbing genitals on things, that's where I shine.
__Leonard Good?
__Penny No, still hideous.
__Leonard Well, I'm sure at some point, we won't even notice it's there.
__Penny Yeah, you'd think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.
__Theodore I think it brings the room together.
__Raj I'll do it.
__Stuart Why do you get to do it? I'm the artist.
__Raj Just because you're starving doesn't make you an artist.
__Stuart Just because I look sickly doesn't mean I'm starving.
__Bernadette Howard!
__Howard Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.
__Bernadette I think I'm in labour.
__Howard Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan.
__Stuart I'll get the hospital bag.
__Raj I'll pull the van up.
__Raj Team Baby, go.
__Bernadette I love you, too.
__Stuart Are we hugging or having a baby? Let's go.
__Bernadette Here comes another contraction.
__Stuart Let's pick it up.
__Raj All right, hold on. I'm gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs.
__Howard Stop that, this isn't India.
__Raj Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
__Howard Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.
__Raj I love you, too. We're good.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy What's wrong?
__Sheldon It's midnight. Happy birthday.
__Amy Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.
__Sheldon This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.
__Amy I'll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?
__Sheldon A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I'd be ripped.
__Amy I love it. Thank you.
__Sheldon And it's not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.
__Amy Is that okay?
__Sheldon I didn't put on my come-hither plaid PJ's for nothing.
__Amy You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery.
__Penny Guys, wake up. Bernadette's having her baby.
__Leonard Come on, we're going to the hospital.
__Amy I guess, I guess we should stop.
__Sheldon Yeah. I'm afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.
__Howard I'm the father.
__Midwife Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?
__Howard No idea. Ask him.
__Raj 12 minutes.
__Midwife 12 minutes? Why are you here?
__Stuart Aren't we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?
__Midwife This is a hospital, not the airport.
__Bernadette I'm sorry. It's our first time.
__Midwife It's okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we're having?
__Howard No, we're keeping it a surprise.
__Midwife Old school. Nice.
__Bernadette Not that old school. He knows.
__Raj You see, I was at the doctor's office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.
__Howard And talking like this doesn't make it less creepy.
__Midwife Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.
__Raj I'm sorry, that's ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?
__Midwife I'm just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.
__Sheldon Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.
__Leonard Damn, I need my inhaler.
__Amy Just don't smoke.
__Leonard No, I went down the stairs too fast.
__Penny Hey.
__Raj Don't come to the hospital. We're headed home.
__Penny Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?
__Bernadette We showed up too early. We'll keep you posted.
__Penny Okay, well, we'll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It's gonna be a while.
__Sheldon I'm starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.
__Leonard I found it, but it's empty.
__Penny Well, it doesn't matter. We're not going to the hospital now.
__Leonard Are you sure? I'd really like to.
__Amy Well, should we, uh, head back up?
__Penny Well while we're all awake, why don't we go to a diner or something?
__Amy Oh, uh, I don't know. Sheldon, you don't want to do that, do you?
__Sheldon It doesn't matter what I want. It's your birthday, you decide.
__Penny Oh, my God. It's your birthday. Let's do something fun.
__Amy Uh.
__Penny We could go to a bar.
__Amy Well.
__Leonard Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.
__Penny Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!
__Sheldon That's a bit childish, isn't it?
__Penny I'm sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?
__Sheldon Grape. I find it the most mild.
__Penny All right, well, you two go have fun.
__Leonard If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.
__Penny Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.
__Raj You'll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren't quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here's your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn't.
__Howard All right, enough with the camera.
__Raj Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she's gonna want to see this.
__Howard I'm sorry, who's gonna want to see this?
__Raj I, I said she, but lot's of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!
__Stuart You're doing great.
__Bernadette Raj.
__Raj Well, okay, I'm gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.
__Bernadette How could you?
__Howard We made it this far without knowing, and you've ruined it.
__Raj Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.
__Stuart You told me it was a girl, and I didn't say it.
__Bernadette Raj.
__Raj You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
__Stuart Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.
__Sheldon Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.
__Amy I'm sorry.
__Sheldon Oh, don't be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.
__Amy Well, shall we start over?
__Sheldon Very well.
__Amy What's wrong?
__Sheldon I'm not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it's feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.
__Amy Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood's a little different now. We, we don't have to rush.
__Sheldon Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we're doing it, and I don't want to disappoint them.
__Amy And the mood continues to change.
__Sheldon No, and also, I don't want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it's your birthday. I can soldier through this.
__Amy Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
__Sheldon Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…
__Amy It's not about trains.
__Sheldon Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
__Amy Stop talking about trains.
__Sheldon Who's killing the mood now?
__Penny Well, I didn't until I heard that.
__Leonard Hang on. I'm counting. It's okay.
__Raj Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they're having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again.
__Penny Maybe if we're quiet, he'll go away.
__Raj You're gonna have to be quieter than that.
__Amy One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I'd let Harry Potter make things hotter.
__Sheldon Wowza.
__Sheldon What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.
__Amy I did. Am I in trouble?
__Sheldon Yes, you're in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.
__Amy Wait, what just happened?
__Sheldon You know I've been wanting to go.
__Amy Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?
__Sheldon Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
__Amy Ooh. Happy birthday to me.
__Raj Hello.
__Amy Is this about the baby?
__Raj No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
__Amy Good. Then you're used to this.
__Penny Hey, Bernadette's water broke.
__Leonard Come on, everyone to the hospital.
__Amy You have got to be kidding me.
__Stuart I'm not an old man, I just can't see at night.
__Bernadette Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal's on the right.
__Stuart All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call 'em out.
__Amy 21,369 –> 00:12:23,536
__ Yeah, but I thought this
__ baby was supposed to ruin their sex life, not mine.
__ This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now.
__Leonard Well, it is their child.
__Raj I know that. But to be fair, I've spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I'm being generous.
__Sheldon Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.
__Raj And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.
__Amy I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?
__Sheldon She's right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I'm not going to ruin her birthday. I'll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.
__Bernadette I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
__Howard Uh, Stuart, while you're out there, don't come back.
__Stuart Okay.
__Howard So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she's a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.
__Bernadette We could name her after your mom.
__Howard Debbie? No. She hated that name.
__Bernadette Did she have a middle name?
__Howard Melvina.
__Bernadette Let's keep thinking.
__Howard Ah. It sucks that she's not here.
__Bernadette I know.
__Howard Hm. She would've been the best grandma.
__Bernadette She did always have candy in her pocket.
__Howard Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.
__Bernadette I didn't know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?
__Howard Thank God you answered right, we wouldn't be here today.
__Amy Yeah. Penny, you're the one who introduced him to Bernie.
__Penny How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
__Leonard It's not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we've all come.
__Stuart Hmm. You two got married.
__Amy Sheldon and I are living together.
__Sheldon But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.
__Leonard Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she's a successful pharmaceutical rep.
__Penny Okay, you don't have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.
__Stuart Howard went to space.
__Amy Bernadette got her doctorate.
__Leonard Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.
__Amy We've all come a long way. There's a lot to be proud of.
__Raj For God's sake, just drive in the knife, why don't you.
__Stuart What's your problem?
__Raj Well, you're all thinking it, I'm the only one who hasn't done anything worthwhile.
__Sheldon I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.
__Stuart Raj, if it's any consolation, I'm no better off than I was ten years ago.
__Raj Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I'm every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.
__Sheldon Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don't say.
__Raj Excuse me.
__Leonard Sorry, Stuart.
__Stuart Hey, I'm in a hospital and I'm not the patient. I'm fine.
__Bernadette I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right.
__Howard Do you want me to get the nurse?
__Sheldon Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn't swallow it, but Amy said it counted.
__Raj Hey.
__Stuart Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?
__Penny You know, Raj, honey, you're being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn't even talk to women. I mean, you couldn't even talk if one was in the room.
__Raj Oh, great, now I can say things like I can't believe you're breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I'll still help you move.
__Penny Anyone else want to try?
__Penny Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.
__Raj I bought the first one, it didn't fall.
__Penny Here.
__Penny Oh!
__Raj Congratulations.
__Amy How's Bernadette?
__Howard Tired, but great. They're both great.
__Penny Does the baby have a name yet?
__Howard We have named her Halley.
__Penny – Oh.
__Leonard Oh, like Halley's comet.
__Howard Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she's not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.
__Amy That's not a real thing, he's just joking.
__Howard I'm gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can't wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather.
__Raj Really?
__Howard Of course.
__Raj You hear that, Stuart? I've got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing.
__Sheldon Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It's fun to think about.
__ Leonard; I wonder which one's Halley.
__ Kind of hard to see the names.
__Penny Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.
__Amy They all look the same to me.
__Raj Guys, she's my goddaughter, I think I'll know when I see her. That one.
__Sheldon It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius.
__Amy I was afraid you'd be too tired.
__Sheldon Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that's not foreplay, I don't know what is.
__Leonard Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year's.
__Penny Yeah, but he doesn't live here anymore.
__Leonard Well, he doesn't live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that's the same man who complains you can't find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.
__Penny Oh. It's Bernadette. She says they're running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.
__Leonard Well, he didn't throw up on the baby. That's a win.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Amy Hi.
__Penny Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
__Sheldon Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.
__Amy It was not a great trip.
__Penny Well, you're home now.
__Sheldon Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don't you maniacs own a calendar?
__Penny I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.
__Penny So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?
__Leonard And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.
__Sheldon Well, we were on our way to my mother's house…
__ Flashback.
__ How did we get in the car?
__ Back to apartment.
__ Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
__Amy I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.
__ Flashback.
__ So, while we're at your mother's house, it might be a good time to tell her that we're living together.
__Sheldon Do we have to? I really don't want to hear the religious lecture.
__Amy Maybe there won't be one.
__Sheldon There's always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.
__Amy Well, she likes me. You know, there's a chance she might be okay with it.
__Sheldon Eh, I don't know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.
__ Back to apartment.
__ Do boys have flowers?
__Leonard Who knows what he has down there.
__Penny Mm.
__Sheldon Anyway…
__ Flashback.
__ Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.
__Sheldon Given that your hands prepared it, isn't that a little self-serving?
__Mary You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you're in a church with a guitar.
__Amy Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.
__Mary Oh, it's my pleasure. Mm. I'm so glad y'all could make it. So, tell me, what's going on back home?
__Amy Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.
__Mary Oh, that's wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?
__Sheldon Welcome to Texas.
__Amy They haven't said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.
__Sheldon Oh, wait, wait, shouldn't we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.
__Mary Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.
__Mary Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.
__Sheldon What? Wh, where's the judgment? Wh, where's the fire and brimstone? Where's the part where you tell us we're going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We're already there.
__Mary Obviously, I would prefer if you weren't living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I'm very happy for you.
__Sheldon And what special circumstances are those?
__ Back to apartment.
__ Oh, boy, I think it's about to get bad.
__ Flashback.
__ Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.
__Sheldon What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?
__Mary No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there'd be nurses.
__Sheldon Well, this is highly insulting.
__Amy Sheldon, don't overreact.
__Sheldon I'm the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn't power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.
__Amy Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
__Mary Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
__ Back to apartment.
__ What?
__Sheldon Well, I was in my room, I couldn't hear what they were saying.
__Amy I'll take over from here.
__ Flashback.
__ He's been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?
__Mary He's upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.
__Amy Are you going to?
__Mary Oh, heck no.
__Amy Sheldon, what, what are you doing?
__Sheldon Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
__Mary You startin' to see why I didn't go in there? Sheldon, if you're trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain't changing my mind.
__Amy We're ignoring the fins, okay.
__Sheldon Yeah. And I don't understand why you're taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she's saying you're a weirdo, too.
__Amy I don't think that's what she's saying.
__ Back to apartment.
__ And?
__Amy That's exactly what she was saying.
__Sheldon Can you believe my mother thinks we're both strange?
__Leonard Absolutely not.
__Penny That's too loud.
__Amy Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.
__Sheldon Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.
__ Flashback.
__ You know, I'm sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you're not alone.
__Sheldon You're right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard's mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton…
__Amy What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
__Sheldon I was going chronologically. You're right between Koothrappali's father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.
__Amy Well, let's try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.
__Sheldon I knew we should've never mentioned us living together in the first place.
__Amy She was gonna find out eventually.
__Sheldon Disagree. We've known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you'd only listened to me.
__Amy Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.
__Sheldon Why would you do that?
__Amy This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.
__Sheldon You managed the situation?
__Amy That's right.
__Sheldon So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I'm incapable of running my own life.
__Amy Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.
__Sheldon I have gotten much better at that.
__Amy Have you? How am I feeling right now?
__Sheldon What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.
__Amy You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
__Sheldon How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
__Amy Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
__Sheldon Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years.
__ Back to apartment.
__ Hi.
__Howard Hey, guys.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Hi. There's the little family!
__Raj Hello.
__Stuart Hello.
__Leonard And their Sherpas.
__Penny Mm.
__Howard The baby's asleep, can we put her in your room?
__Penny Yeah. Go ahead.
__Amy Do you need help?
__Howard No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.
__Bernadette Sorry we're late.
__Penny Oh, it's no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.
__Sheldon Yeah. Here. I'll catch you up.
__ How did we get in the car?
__ Back to apartment.
__ Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head.
__Leonard On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.
__Sheldon I was acting odd intentionally.
__Bernadette Really? So you can control it?
__Penny Okay. Then what happened?
__Sheldon Well, there's really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.  My mother made me take it out.  Amy put alcohol on it.  And here we are.
__Howard What did we miss?
__Bernadette I couldn't explain it if I tried.
__Amy Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.
__Howard So what did you and Leonard do?
__Penny Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.
__Leonard It might've been the worst one we've ever had.
__Raj Oh, my God, what happened?
__Leonard Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me.
__Bernadette It's like I was excited for a present and got socks.
__Stuart I don't understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.
__Sheldon I don't understand what's wrong with socks.
__Penny To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.
__Howard What happened
__Leonard Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.
__Penny Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.
__Leonard Oh cool, I'll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.
__ Time lapse.
__ Stupid idea.
__Penny No, what's stupid is a physicist who doesn't understand when you swing an axe, you don't let go.
__Leonard For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!
__Penny Ugh. It's 70 degrees, you didn't need mittens.
__Leonard You know how easily I blister.
__Penny Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It's like I'm married to an old piece of fruit.
__Leonard Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.
__Penny Fine.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah.
__Penny There's something on the windshield.
__ Flash forward to the stairwell.
__ You need a break?
__Leonard Do not need a break.
__Penny There's no shame in asking for a break.
__Leonard If I need a break, I'll ask for a break.
__ Flash forward.
__ Ugh. Leonard?
__Leonard Yeah?
__Penny There's a tree on you.
__ Flash forward.
__ You want to decorate it tonight?
__Penny Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.
__Leonard I hope it kills us both.
__ Back to apartment.
__ By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.
__Sheldon So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?
__Bernadette Sure.
__Sheldon Hey, how's life with your baby?
__Amy Really? You're never gonna touch their baby?
__Sheldon To this day I've never touched Stuart.
__Bernadette It's been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.
__ Flashback.
__ Oh, please stop crying, I'm begging you. I don't know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh. What have we done?
__Howard Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies.
__Bernadette It took me two hours to get her down.
__Raj You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn't hear it. Not always, sometimes we'd leave.
__Howard Hey, he got her to stop.
__Bernadette That was so fast.
__Raj Oh, he's really good with her.
__Bernadette Yeah, he has a gift.
__Howard What's the matter?
__Bernadette Nothing, these are happy tears.
__Howard Oh, good.
__Bernadette No they're not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can't?
__Howard I mean, it's Stuart. Maybe she's playing possum until he goes away.
__Bernadette Not funny.
__Raj She's tired, that was funny.
__Bernadette Everyone's a better mom than me.
__ Back to apartment.
__ Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
__Leonard Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?
__Stuart Oh, I just talked to her. I've been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.
__Penny You poor things you must be exhausted.
__Howard It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.
__ Flashback.
__ How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
__Howard She doesn't hate you, stop saying that.
__Bernadette Now you hate me too.
__Howard Shh, I don't hate you.
__ Back to apartment.
__ It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they're doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.
__Bernadette Thank you, Sheldon, I'm feeling better now.
__Sheldon Thank you, Internet. I'm telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.
__Penny So things started to turn around?
__Bernadette Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.
__Leonard Please tell me you didn't use Amy's magic juice.
__ Flashback.
__ Bernie?
__Bernadette Shh. She's asleep.
__Howard Great. And where are you?
__Bernadette Down here.
__Howard Oh. This is new.
__Bernadette I didn't know what else to do. It worked.
__Howard Well, I'd say that's thinking outside the box, but, come on.
__Bernadette I think I live here now. It's fine.
__Howard Is it okay if I get some sleep?
__Bernadette Yeah, go ahead.
__Howard Good job, Mommy. I'm proud of you.
__Bernadette Don't make me cry, either.
__Howard Good night. I love both my girls.
__Bernadette We love you, too.
__ Back to apartment.
__ I can't believe you fit in the crib.
__Bernadette I could take a bath in the sink. I don't, but I can.
__Raj So how were your holidays?
__Stuart Oh, thank you for asking. Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother. She's in Bakersfield. Uh, usually my brother and sister go… oh come on.
__Bernadette Yeah, thanks.
__Penny Our pleasure.
__Leonard See you guys at work.
__Raj Be there bright and early.
__Howard Not me, paternity leave.
__Sheldon Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife's genitals and he gets time off.
__Howard With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this.
__Leonard Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.
__Penny Oh, that is so thoughtful.
__Leonard Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you'd ever had?
__Penny Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that's it.
__Leonard and this wine is why.
__Penny Oh. Hey, what smells so good?
__Leonard I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.
__Penny Pink wine and pizza bagels? It's like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.
__Leonard Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I'm gonna keep it to myself.
__Penny Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can't believe you did all this.
__Leonard Well, you know, It's easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it's like a river. It's peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it's like a secret that I could never keep.
__Penny You did not just quote an Nsync song.
__Leonard I quoted your favourite Nsync song.
__Penny Oh.
__ Out of daydream sequence.
__ Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Why?
__Sheldon I'm trying to take more of an interest in other people's lives.
__Leonard That's nice. I wear a size eight and a half.
__Sheldon That's small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?
__Leonard Are you gonna laugh at the answer?
__Sheldon Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
__Leonard If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she's taking me.
__Sheldon Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you'll come home with. My money's on fungal. They're still having girls night across the hall.
__Leonard So, hang out with me and we'll have boys' night.
__Sheldon At our age, why don't we call it man's night?
__Leonard Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
__Penny I hadn't really thought about it.
__Amy But now you're thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.
__Bernadette Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?
__Amy Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He's like my boyfriend in college, except he's real, so people can see him.
__Bernadette I've been seeing him for years, I'm still not convinced he's real.
__Penny Hey, can I ask you a question? You've been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?
__Bernadette Uh oh, what's going on?
__Penny Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.
__Bernadette It's okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino's guy brings the pizza like this now.
__Amy Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don't think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.
__Amy Uh, Penny, I don't know how to say this, but this is my first girls' night and you're kind of bumming everybody out.
__Howard Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she'll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I'm surprised I didn't wake her up walking out of the room.
__Raj Have you tried anything to fix it?
__Howard Well, i put the rug down. It didn't help.
__Raj I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?
__Raj Did that do anything?
__Howard Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that's why I bought the rug.
__Leonard Oh, no. Good game.
__Penny Hey.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon Oh, Penny, I'm trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls' night?
__Penny Oh, it was fine.
__Sheldon Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
__Penny Uh, chips.
__Sheldon Anything to drink?
__Penny Some wine.
__Sheldon Well, I'm just playing tennis against the drapes here.
__Leonard Just ignore him.
__Penny Hm. At least he took an interest.
__Leonard What's that supposed to mean?
__Penny Nothing.
__Leonard Hey, what's going on with you?
__Penny I don't want to talk about it.
__Leonard Well, hey, come on, just tell me.
__Penny Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you've been taking me for granted.
__Leonard What? Where is this coming from?
__Sheldon Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.
__Penny It's just, since we got married you seem to think you don't have to try any more.
__Leonard That is ridiculous.
__Penny This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about it.
__Leonard No, no, no, no, let's talk about it. I'm the one who's made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?
__Penny Okay, you know what? Maybe I'll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.
__Leonard Fine, go ahead.
__Sheldon Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.
__Howard That sounds expensive.
__Howard MIT's motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.
__Raj Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn't step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?
__Howard No.
__Raj Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?
__Howard No.
__Bernadette I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
__Howard Is that supposed to be funny?
__Raj Hold on. Yeah, that's funny.
__Leonard Mm-hmm.
__Amy I'll call you when we get to the hotel.
__Sheldon And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
__Amy I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.
__Leonard Have fun.
__Penny Thanks. Are you ready?
__Amy Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.
__Sheldon You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
__Leonard Go ahead, it's fine.
__Sheldon Bye.
__Amy Bye.
__Leonard Okay.
__Penny Let's go.
__Amy Bye.
__Sheldon Bye.
__Amy I'll miss you.
__Sheldon Yeah, I'll miss you too.
__Amy I'll miss you more.
__Sheldon Well, if x equals the amount that you'll miss me, then I'll miss you x plus one.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Leonard Thanks.
__Leonard Earl grey?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Honey?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Leonard Unsweetened almond…
__Sheldon Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.
__Leonard Sorry, thank you.
__Sheldon Well, what can we do to cheer you up?
__Leonard I really don't know.
__Sheldon You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?
__Leonard I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn't the only relationship you're phoning in.
__Leonard Its not that I'd stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.
__Sheldon Hmm. Yeah, you're right. It's like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I'm just like, eh.
__Raj It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.
__Raj Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.
__Howard Okay, space A3, here we go. It's squeaking. Mark it.
__Howard Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.
__Howard It's a tradition of my people.  If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum.
__Raj Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song.
__Leonard Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
__Sheldon Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?
__Leonard I don't want to wait two days for us to work this out.
__Sheldon Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don't see why your divorce should be any different.
__Leonard I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you're all I got.
__Amy Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just 'cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.
__Penny Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.
__Amy I don't know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?
__Penny Well, yeah.
__Amy Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny What are you doing here?
__Leonard I came here to apologize.
__Penny Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself.
__Leonard Okay. I don't get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.
__Sheldon Hello, Amy. It's nice to see you.
__Amy Nice to see you, too.
__Sheldon And that's how you make effort look effortless.
__Penny All right. Can you please just go and we'll talk about this tomorrow?
__Leonard I don't understand what you want.
__Penny I'm trying to figure it out.
__Sheldon You know what? If you'd like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I'm at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.
__Amy Sheldon, why don't we give them some privacy?
__Sheldon Very well. Hey, later we'll check out the minibar, I'll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.
__ once you get the hang of it. Step. Step. Hop onto Ottoman.
__ Don't do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.
__Howard Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you're there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea.
__Bernadette You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.
__Raj Hold on, I don't think she was impressed.
__Howard Bigger problems, I felt something pop.
__Amy Uh-huh.
__Sheldon Do they know it's there? I mean, should I tell somebody?
__Amy It's there on purpose. It's refreshing.
__Sheldon Interesting. The world's most boring liquid and the world's most boring vegetable, but you put 'em together and bleugh.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Hey.
__Sheldon Oh good, you're here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas's?
__Penny We're not getting divorced.
__Leonard Listen, we realized, that, uh, we're facing some new challenges as a married couple.
__Penny Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can't believe I'm about to say this, um.
__Leonard Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that's tailored to us, okay, we don't need a bathroom schedule.
__Penny Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.
__Leonard What do you say?
__Sheldon I get to write a contract? I say, let's get this party of the first part started.
__Amy It's in our agreement. I have to laugh.
__Penny Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.
__Leonard Does it really need to say that?
__Sheldon I did this for free, let me get a little something.
__Leonard Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn't. Other unacceptable responses include, it's nothing, don't worry about it, and, I said it's nothing don't worry about it.
__Penny I think this all looks good.
__Leonard Me, too.
__Sheldon Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you're accepting Leonard in as is condition.
__Amy I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
__Sheldon Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
__Amy Right, right. Got it.
