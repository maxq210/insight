The "real you".
Did you change your hair?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
In 9th.  For a month
But you hate Joey
You did what?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Oh, God.  It's starting.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
It's a lung cancer issue
He's pretty!
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What've you got for me?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Two legs, nice rack...
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You need money to take a girl out
I just upped my price
Does this conversation have a purpose?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
William would never have gone to a state school.
You hate me don't you?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
I hate him.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
So what did I have an effect on ?
The Partridge Family?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Why can't we agree on this?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Which parts?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
What?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
You were right. She's still pissed.
In the microwave.
Your daughters went to the prom.
Absolutely not.
He's the devil's child...
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
I haven't given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
They took everything...
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
No...
No?
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Chief knows.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I suppose we're both old men now.
I knew you would.
What did they say about Granada before today?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
You think I don't know that?
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You tell that to them!
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Your mother was blind?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Now I become custody of police department?
I will if they don't send me back.
What about back home?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Yeah, right.
When?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Are you hit?
Who's there?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
You got any better ideas?
I'm on duty.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
So...who's Nicky?
Is it drug related?
That's good.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Okay.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Where's Czech girl?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Is there a problem?
Let me get a shot of it.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
A job?
As a plumber?!
I want to hear everything he said.
I speak English.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
I used an accelerant.
Get outta here!
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
Yes.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Good morning. How's it going?
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
CONTINUED
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Any ideas about the colour?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Thank you.
True.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Here you go, baby.
You lying son of a bitch...
You got a name, cop?
I got a lot to protect.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Where's luther?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Thanks.
Yeah...
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
I lost them, that's what happened.
I didn't have the time.
Billy Bear...
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Bullshit red tape.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What'd you do?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
How would you know?
Stall.
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Five.  On credit.
Give it back.
Corn-i-Lius?
What're you laughing about?
He's a she!
Good luck..
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
And then?
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I don't have time... I need to know.
I was talking to the cat.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
6... 5...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
What mission?
Where have I heard this song before?
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
You're nothing but a... a...
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
At least I won lunch.
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Staedert, do you read me?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
...Not far, now.
Welcome home.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What happened to you?
Don't...
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What do you want?
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
And they are?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Any good?
I know what you did.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
What do you want?
I want his name.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Show me where you buried her.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
I never killed anyone.
Give me the film.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
There's not much illegal.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Not quite.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Sounds good, pops.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Specialty product.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
No.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
I didn't mean to...
Are you religious?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
How... how can you say that to me...?
Who is this... ?
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
What is this?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
What?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
You what?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
T-T-Thanks Alice...
So?
Nice neighborhood.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Feeling better now?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
But how are we gonna --
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
What is it?
My father!  He's not - ?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Huh?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
Somewhere down there?
Seems to be all around...
The frogmen?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Under <u>water</u>?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
What do you think?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
Well, I'll be - !
Who?
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't mind if I do.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Where'd you get the blood?
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Yes.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
You don't want the extra police pay?
Fuck you.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
What do I have to do for it?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Want to buy?
You and Mel Gordon?
Good. Who?
I'm sorry.
What way?
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
This is nuts.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Nothing.
You remember Margie Fogg?
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Twombley.
What happened?
Yeah, I guess.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Wade, are you alright?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I don't drink coffee.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Where are we now?
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Now, or he dies, please.
I know he left you behind.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Flying the plane.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Did you feel that?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, we're taking off!
Not now, Elaine!
I'd use the word insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
He's a boy dog.
What?
Sixteen 'C', why?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You've been hurt.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Surely you can't be serious.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
What's the matter?
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
What's his problem?
Yes?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
You promise you'll write.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Yes?
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Let's talk Hubley.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
In the other man's rectum.
Stop the car.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Uh, George...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
No!  We must do this alone.
Harcourt is dead.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Ss'kya'ta'.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
That the atmosphere processor?
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Still nothing from the colony?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Alive?
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Ellen.
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Mommy...Mommy?
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
His Grace is very angry with you.
Maestro.
Why?
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Now?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Tish-I'm-tee.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
You borrowed money from your mother?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I'm not telling you.
Go back to bed.
Excellency!
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Not at all.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Hey!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Gertrude!
Really?
Just one year.
What a charming idea. May I see?
May I try it?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
And the result satisfies.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this, Salieri?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Your Majesty!
Why so?
Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
I have no idea.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Why are you here?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
How many pupils do you have?
No one calls you that.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
What medicine?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
What?
Leave that alone!
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Did you like it, then?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
What happened? Is it over?
This is only a vaudeville.
No! No, it's him!
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Where did I stop?
Oh, yes.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Herr Mozart -
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
About what?
Are they?
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Here in Vienna.
Well?
All Vienna has heard that.
What?
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
He's setting that play to music?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Well, promise then.
I agree, Baron.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Yes, I am looking after him.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Oh, Miss Price?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
He's not?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Yes, I should think so.
I beg your pardon?
Yes?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
I was. What are you reading?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Bathroom.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
I was awake and he was in my room.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Anything.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
No.
All right, you two, move along.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
What time is it?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Well, I like it here.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Nice looking group.
Ask them what the candles are for.
You ask them.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
You look awful.
What about the zoo?
Because this must be stopped.
I could hang myself.
Sorry, love.
Hello, Tom.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
Whose death?
What's the matter, Charlie?
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Oh!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Why are you so anxious?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
Why, Matt!
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
The theatre?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Good morning.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
I already told him I was home.
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
If he can do it, yes.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
What'll we do?
I'm afraid so.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
It couldn't have been earlier?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
He's smiling.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
We got a problem here, brother?
This is the best score yet.
I'm sorry, Cole.
Damn!
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What?
Not now.
She was European!
Yep.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Fine. We hit this bank.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Both would be nice.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Strategically.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Web died fighting?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
That would have made an impression.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I don't understand.
I beg your pardon?
Yes ma'am.
But I like the presidential suite.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Did you order our houses burned down?
You almost ended my career before it began.
Yes?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Was it worth it?
I'm not hanged yet.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Thank you.
Right here in church?
Well, not exactly.
I swear.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Yes sir.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Your men knew the risks.
What is that?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
On a lot of lithium?
Yes?
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Nice?
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
Where are you going?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
I think you should go now.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
SHUT UP!
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick?
Jean?
Anywhere you want?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
What's that?
What are I doing?
...to the office this afternoon.
A model? An actor?
What?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Coffee?
Oh no, I'm okay.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Would you rather I not smoke?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Al.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Yes, Owen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
"Make" him?
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Milo?
Right. Wait. A toast.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Milo?
My goodness.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
How's it going?
Well -- you sent for me.
What're you implying.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Oh. Yeah.
...Something like that. Yeah.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
They'd frame him.
Who can we trust?
What about "60 Minutes."
How close are you?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
What'd he say?
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
That's lame, isn't it?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Did you tell Alice?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Hungry.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
We know all that, Exposition.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Thank you, Exposition.
What?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Excuse me?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
Here, use mine.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Who?
Shut up.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
I'm proud of you.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Did you ever...
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Red ...
... preserve...
... love ...
Would that I could say the Same.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
Mr. John Steed, please.
To find out who killed my husband.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
You followed me.
To kill me?
You're playing games.
Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Mrs. Peel?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Surveillance? By whom?
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Why?
Anyone particular in mind?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
If you say so.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
You're kidding.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
I've decided not to run for President.
All right!
Hello?
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
What's the matter?
Um... that's very relaxing.
Let go of me!
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
A strange wang right in my palm.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
It's on the tenth floor.
I'd love that.
No, Brett, I...
Olivier's in that, right?
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
My Debbie?
You're late again, Rick.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
-- He killed people --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
Yeah? What about Laura --
I'm in heaven, Lt.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Ready?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
I saw it.
-- What were they doing there?
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
I was doing my job.
Hi.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What'll you do?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
I don't have a story.
Trychticholorate.
I need another one, sir.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
I don't guess.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
What reason?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did you pull me out?
Brian?
Four months.
Four months?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Do you have to do that?
So, you surviving without me?
Management were pin heads.
Coffee sucked.
He's going to be a fireman.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
"Don?"
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
People.
Nah...
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Everybody say Ho!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
I'm not smiling.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Good morning, Cheeba.
De-la-croix.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Four minutes ago.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
It's been a long time.
How did you end up here?
That's what I'm askin'.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Sounds risky to me.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Hello.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
You feel good, not nervous?
You sound like the media.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
What do you mean?
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Money and nothing else?
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Oh her.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
...I heard different, thought that was...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
What is your uncle's name?
I have acted as I think fit.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
I'll match any man with the sword.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Not even that.
Not one.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
I beg your pardon?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Did -- did you --
Yeah, right...
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
I didn't shoot West --
I apologize --
And he'd been shot.
You saved Kendall's life --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Where?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Sir, yes, sir!
Why?
So you killed him?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Look in my pack.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
Why?
Where are they!
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
That bad?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Home, I'm done.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
That's preposterous --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Baseball?
Something like that. You?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
We're fucked, I know --
I pushed him too hard.
You wanted to get the truth.
Yeah.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
It won't work --
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
This is totally unnecessary --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Who is she? Where does she live?
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Really.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
I never knew.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
So how does it happen?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
I will.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Dad!
Let's get out of here.
I'm sorry.
They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Hello.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
It's bad.
That's because most of it never happened.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
You know what for.
Do you want to stop?
What's this?
Do you like it?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
And...
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You're asking for my documents?
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I do. I want to very badly.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
He will come back.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Sometimes neither.
Excuse me?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Have you had any before?
Are you scared?
What?
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Angela?
You didn't have to do this.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
How you let men treat ya like they do?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
What do you want?
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
You take it straight?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Where you gonna be?
By myself?
You need some weed?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
What'chu sayin'?
How a girl get like that?
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Then what?
Why she got a chain on her?
You could put it that way.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Are you wasted?
The hell are you talkin' about?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
I think she got to you, pappy.
Get rid of it.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
-- I should tear your head off.
Some party.
What are you doing?
Not a prayer.
What'd you say?
What does Charlie mean?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Nick!
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Why the hell not?
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
Know her?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Yakuza.
You can't come in.  They don't want --
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
How many men?
Thank you.  You have one?
A wife.  She left.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
What do you chant?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
What if I chant?
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Keep the change.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
One guy do all the damage?
Why me?
Could you fill me in?
I have to get to Sugai.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Let's go while there is still time.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
I want to do it.
Industrial refuse.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Why, yes, of course.
Next.
It's okay.  Forget it.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
Sorry.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What's suck night?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
I bet I would.
So?
Did you cry when your father died?
Yeah.
They could clean around the arrangement.
But then how can you...
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
What?
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
You want to go home?
I don't have one.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Your mom was a dancer?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
My office.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I haven't brushed yet.
See, ya.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
How long would you need me?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Wait! Wait!
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Why?!
They're all divorced?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Yes, ma'am!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
The what?
Hey, Eve!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Okay. I like that.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
But, Eve, I would--
Eve?!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
What?
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
These are wonderful.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
I promise. Is that all?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Right on the button.
Russia.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Thirty-five.
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up there!!
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Say what?!
I do alright.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
We have to go.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
He drank it hot?
Really?
Watch this!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Calvin!
No.
I thought ten years.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
He go back to the hotel?
We did not leave together.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Then what?
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
I've seen a few.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
The criminals are winning.
What is this? What color is it?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
THEN WHAT?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
No.
You can hit me, if you want to.
You don't?
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
I liked being with you last night.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Oh no.
He's comin' back? What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hello?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
What time are visiting hours?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
What's the plan.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Who, me? Why should it?
Goodnight.
What am I going to do?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
What was that all about?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Fuck you.
Look under the body.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
You guys?
Hello.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Absolutely not.
Yes.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Rule of thumb?
Pee...Per...Man.
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
Hey Murph.
Worst day of my life, man.
What is it my son?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
The... The funny man.
He's a nigger.
OK. That's wrong.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
She's really kind of hot.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
But he didn't say anything.
Is it back in?
You think we're going to be chased?
Why not?
Yes, they are.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Inez, this is --
Where was it parked?
When'd he tell you?
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I think we better go home.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
What do you think?
OK. Mark that down.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Do you like Inez?
Yeah. As a girl.
We all set?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
What?
I'll see you there.
Yeah.
Pretty much everything.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
You mean a safecracker?
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Death.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Yeah.
Hector woudn't do anything.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Anthony, I --
Bob, where you going?
You think I'm improving?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Give him a second.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
What do you mean?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
What?
Are you a fag?
Not even for emergencies?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I warned you, Dignan.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Not in that car you're not.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Applejack drove.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
How you doing, Bob?
He said what?
Oh, yeah.
Why?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
No. Just pool.
There was a mistake.
Do you know what his budget was?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Did he say anything to you?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
She say what time I should call?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
I have to go now.
I emptied it.
Front. Use your teeth.
What do you want?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
What's going on in Berlin?
-- what? --
Conklin up front.
Sleep. Sleep now.
But we were so careful.
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
So when was I here?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Alright... take it down.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Mr. Nevins?
Amnesia?
Some women like Dobermans --
And why is that?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Anything?
Young Robert, we are honored --
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
How many?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
We must run in different directions!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Where is my son?
Shall I leave, M'lord?
I have faced him. Have you?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Then when?
I need you so much! I love you!
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
You have... you have a husband.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
But you must have something to go on?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Sure...
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
Where are you now?
But I... I need those books.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
Ouch.
So how's Tommy?
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Not if you remember my dad.
Where... where are my clothes?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Ha! Where's that?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
What time is it?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
And you are...?
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Destroy it?
What the hell are you doing?
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Yes?
Go back to Bulgaria.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Er, good luck, yes.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Yes, something.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
No.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
My German's a little rusty.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
I didn't count the days.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
No, not yet.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Hello, Sam.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Apparently he has the letters.
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
-- Yes?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
My office.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Thank you.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
No. It's all arranged.
Everything in order?
Yes.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Victor Laszlo.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Oh, it's my party.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Huh?
Oh, thanks.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
No.
You ever going to bed?
No. Not me, boss.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Can't.  Need water.
Fix raft first.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
You can't make it.
You know what happened to this?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Well, not really, I --
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
I've got lots of time.
Cold.
Chuck.
Merry Christmas eve.
He's your cute thing.
"We're" not over-reacting.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I would never --
This is so unfair.
I love you, Chuck.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Which I didn't have.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
What?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Permission granted.
Only if you can afford it.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
I mean your parents.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Oh...
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
You don't understand! It's her father...
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
That's a heavy sedation.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
I just wanted to ask you...
But did you know him?
Did you grow up around here?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
There was no visible wound?
I haven't read that.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
We heard that one already, Homer.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
We had to finalize the deal.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Shit.
When?
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Come here. Feel this.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Sorry, I --
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Why?
Lighten up.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
WHAT?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Glenn talked you out of it.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What do you want? An apology?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
Miles...
What do we need another Shill for?
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
I'll take you up on that.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Ouch.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
Good night?
I had training. In the Republic.
What's the time?
Probably.
You're my conscience.
Leave it.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
I want to buy a car.
Great.
It's not that.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
There's a casino in this hotel.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
They mean it.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
The point is, they want a man inside.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
What for?
Yes.
Detective Inspector Ross.
You did?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Nice car.
You've done pretty well.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Rough day?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
How many aces are left?
Five.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
How?
Yes.
Very impressive.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
How do you feel, Jack?
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
What's he doin'?
The key!
Key? Key? What is the key?
It didn't go off.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
But how do you know you exist?
Right!
This is fun.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Doolittle...
Yes.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
-- automatic channels open --
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Man, you got a bad attitude.
That's a lotta crap.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
Out there.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
I don't get involved with guns.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
No...
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Who is...
Lauren's not my wife.
I won't be staying.
Bent?
You need to get out more.
The other one like you...
I'm sorry.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You believe that?
And you still think you can do something to change that.
With your help.
Know where I can find her?
You don't want to.
I understand.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
You're crazy.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
No.
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
And because he's my friend.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They're prisoners to their genes.
I actually know how this works.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
You left out condescending.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Okay, okay, okay--
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
What about this?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
No problem.
Right, slow...
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Ann Arbor?
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
What are you, high?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
One more time in English.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Whoa... she just farted.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Damn straight we are.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
It's my Bullworker.
Cool.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Mom, what're we...?
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Is that your final answer?
So... that's it?
Dea ex machina...
How can you do that?
Where did you come from?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Why is that?
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Did you call the cops?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Know what?
Why should we care?
His name is Frank.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
What about your family, Donnie?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Nothing.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
I... I was playing with fire.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
He was a year ahead of us?
Yep.
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Chut up!
There's no rule!
What is this shit?
Where is she?!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Loretta, never have kids.
Really?
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Yah?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Go on! Get out!
Ow!
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
We was robbed.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Tammy Curry?
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
The king can do to wrong! 
"My President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
But you're my father -
Father...
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Why wasn't I insulted?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
Excellency, may I present my niece.
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Now -- er --
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Never mind that, I want my man!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
I don't understand.
I could easily arrange...
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Tell me about it, please!
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Of course! You want out?
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Thank you... very much.
My... name is...
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Oh no, I couldn't.
Fine.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
Are you the proprietor?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
It's all right! It isn't happening!
Those things in your hands.
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
How do we know this is the way?
I shouldn't have come.
I see the world.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Shut up.
Oh, get it over with.
You DON'T like it, do you?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Aaagh! Rape!
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
What are you talking about?
It's Halfdan the Black!
What's it all about?
Who have you been talking to?
Faster!
SHUT UP!
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Why should WE care?
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
No! Let go, Snorri!
I've got you!
What's the matter with them?
I AM one, Dad!
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Sven!
He hasn't.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
He used to puke in his sleep.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
It's a tradition.
I must KILL! Kill!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And something to sharpen them with?
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
And I just liked you so much.
Come over after I'm done here?
You rat.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I'm sorry.
Really? Because --
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
You like that?
You pick it.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
No, it isn't that.
What do you mean?
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
Right. Something black though.
It's very late.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Okay.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Female.
When?
I think I should go back.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Says you were a bully...
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Hi.
How's it going?
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Clementine.
Definitely!
Sorry. I just --
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
No way. I can handle this.
Nothing.
Okay, we're back in.
That's lovely.
Stan? What's going on?
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
It's an apartment.
This one's history. Moving on...
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Yep.
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
It's holding... She's holding...!
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Hear what?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Thank you.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
What's on your mind?
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Peters is right, no one's here.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Skipper...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
We're leaving.
You... You can't do that!
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
It tastes bad.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
No. It was someone else.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
What?
Blow it up?
He's been past Mars?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
The safety circuit's failed!
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben --
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Apparently I can disappear.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
No. I want my money back right now.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Hi, Brad.
Does Mom know you have company?
Any problems?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Take that back.
We've got to get an abortion?
No.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
He was hot, wasn't he?
What variables?
Was it great?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
He's not coming.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
That's a nice shirt.
Is this your first time?
What's your other question?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
I don't know.
What's April 16th?
What about the notes?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Are you ready to order here?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
What limes?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
You degenerate pig!
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
It's gone too far.
Adrenochrome...
Yes!
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Where are you two going?
IS IT CLEAR?!
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Stop it.
I think I know where a CB is.
You all sure about this?
We just smeared a skunk.
Fuck you too.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
How are you holding up?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
How much you got?
How much you got to see the show?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Well, maybe they migrate?
Let's go!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Oh...
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
I'm not!
Huh.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
...Yes.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
All square, Doc.
...Don't you?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
No.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Are you... are you hungry?
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
But, Kurt, I...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Aren't you ever going back?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Yeah, well --
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
How'd I look?
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
What happened to him?
You don't know what you want.
Frances...
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Well, the studio told me not to.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Anyway... if you need me...
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Yeah. I don't know.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
What?
That's me, Clifford.
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
At one. Promise?
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Oh, just leave those things for now.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Oh! Are you really?
Please sit down...
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Frances, I'm warning you...
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
And he drove me to mine.
What kindness?
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Father's so proud.
I wish to be your wife.
So do I.
Victor!
No. But someday.
Professor?
Henry Clerval.
Only you would think of that!
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
Is that your diagnosis?
You disdain accepted wisdom?
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
You want to leave?
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
Where?
I'll go check on Brenda.
You said we were special.
Chance to get even?
Ha!
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Don't call him.
Best over...
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Another coincidence.
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Why did they block the door again?
On the dresser.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Pass.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
I'm going for 'em!
Mexico.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
Not even for lunch?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Richie? You okay?
Do they have cable?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
This ain't the time.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
I'm here with you.
He needs our help!
The woman I saw you with...
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
So I'll get a fair shot?
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Aw, what is this...
Shit.  Think we're had.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
"Coronado."
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Just do it, okay?
Come on, Montgomery...
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I'll try anyway, sir.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Unless you Whiskey Run.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Me?  Why me?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
At first.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Do you?
Good to see you again, too, sir.
O'Neil...
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Thought you two were file-closed.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Think we can fit up in there?
Most people don't.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
I got pretty close.
...he's pregnant.
Can I use some?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman...
We? I don't think so.
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
That is our job.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
You gave them the tape?
I need you to trust me.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Who the hell are you?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
What's happened?
You have a better plan, Alex?
We heard it the first time!
Hi Brandon.
Yes but, we were wondering-
It's okay. Listen-
Okay...  Okay, now what.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes Commander?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Systems register functional.
... What does that mean?
A hologram...
No, I'll kill you. .
As good as Hopkins?
They're still behind us...
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Your last name.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
What?
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Jason..
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Simpler.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
I... certainly, but-
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Commander...
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
NO NO NO.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Go on... I want to hear everything.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Yes, general.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
Who is that!?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Partially...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Unofficially, General Greene.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
The man is a traitor!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
General Lee, sir!
My God, what?
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
But, you do come from a military family?
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
It's the freest land on earth.
You're kidding me, right?
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
No. What's this?
Trade for what?
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I have to ask you for that key.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
You serious?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
C-18.
Who is this?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
But you work for the casino?
What's it called?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
I had to tell 'em something.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
We talk different?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
So you want to know.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You've been losing.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
We call you a taxi.
What're you doing here?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
Yeah?
You thought I was faking?
You sure?
Were you scared up there?
I'll be right back.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
What a spectacular view.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Guess I'll just keep working.
Maybe that is his boat.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
What is it?
But how long?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Three, four days.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Can't you use something else?
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
You're late.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
What?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Did you see him?
It's not gonna hold us.
The what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
How's that?
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Ho-ly shit.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
It's a Noaa buoy.
Can't find the shotgun.
You're kidding, right?
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Guess.
Someone from the past.
YES.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Hmm.
What do you mean?
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Yeah, right.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Are you the one who left that note?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Nothing.
Then why do you hate me so much?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Why?
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
You can have that one.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
What are you talking about -- who?
SHUT UP!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
Gross!
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Oh yeah...
"Funky"?
Just promise you'll do it.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
There he is...
I didn't get it either.
How about this one?
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
...maybe we should be lesbos...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
How repulsive!
So should I come over?
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
I said "great"...
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
There.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Wow... finally.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Seymour does.
That tape sucked, by the way!
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Well why do I care about that?
A dollar seventy-five.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Oh, right...
Yeah, well...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
I - I'd really rather not...
I don't think so...
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Hey, can I borrow this?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Never...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
And you like them?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
What's up?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What's the matter?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
I-I-I...
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Please Josh?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
You've never built in Africa.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
I do need to see Starling.
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
What if there are complications?-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
Finish your tour?
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
How lucky we are.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Thank you, Samuel.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Hello, Peter.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Good-bye, Peter.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
So far so good.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
What happened?
My Fault!
Are you telling me how to drive?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Damn!
I want to help you.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
Can't you tell me now?
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Die in what sense?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Did you see anything?
All right.  I'll try.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
They will.
Where are you, Pete?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Those are priceless sculptures.
Not yet, dear brother...
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Caesar?
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
I don't know...
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Sneaking around with your brother?
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
You teach them!
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
How much money is involved?
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Do you always drive like this?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
You sure you really want to?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
At the Zoo.
Here? In Berkeley?
All right then! Yes!
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
Because it isn't true.
You won't?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
The day after tomorrow?
Are you listening?
One of those outside agitators.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
What?
Where is your luggage?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
No.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
Drink?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's all right.
Sit down.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Her portrait?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
May I have a drink?
Well -- I don't know.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes?
Will you bring me a hanger?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
How about art.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Is it?
Don't tell Elaine.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Why are you asking me all this?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
How do you think.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Oh my God.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
I see.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You don't have to say that.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Now it seems to me --
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
You believe me, don't you?
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
I've got to go.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
Hello.
Yes?
I'd like to discuss this.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Is anything wrong?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I'll do anything for you.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Yes -- oh!
And then --?
Yes -- tired...
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
I want to be alone.
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
You do believe that I really love you?
For Vienna?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
The Baron is tired?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
No -- not at all.
I take five hundred.
I thought she was splendid!
The war.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Hello! Hello! --
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Oh -- but -- I --
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
What?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
You pay me.
Movies?
You...
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Can't you understand me?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
You see -- what we are interested in --
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
I know -- I know.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Next week.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
Bobo, no, I --
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Want a look?
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Here you are! Two rich people!
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
I know.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Up to you.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
Myra followed you, huh?
You must have some money.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's right.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Get well soon.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
The tap. What you do for a living.
The long end. Big con.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
Gun?
That's that, then.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
I can be real stiff.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Funny, we just drove right in.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
You're kidding with that answer, right?
It's an option.
John, you can't help her now.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Not me.
I can see that.  Why?
Then I'll get caught.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Looks great.  It does.
Yeah.
Look, they're staring right at us.
I have to pee.
Shit, Linda!
Where's Shane?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
He says things.  Bad things.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
What should I do?
My, God!  What have you done to him?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
Where's the child?
This is madness, Wynn.
Jamie's baby ...
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Oh, shit.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
The hell with the diamonds!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
You know what gets me?
Go home!
And how were things?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I forget mine for years on end.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Fifty years?
You're making a joke.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
Gee whiz--
Life has denied me that thrill.
Man and boy.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He insults him all the time.
What's good about that?
It makes life spicy.
Dad was never in England?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Tell me that.
You're supposed to get hurt!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Can I get dressed first?
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
You learned this in some college course?
Yes.
Sneaking in the back door.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Hello, Mother.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Good Lord.
What for?
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
King Arthur.
If you want to be found that way.
She did?
What will you do, Colonel?
Because he was cruel?
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
Oh, Paul--
You're the only woman he ever took out.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He is my father.
Doing what?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
I see.
What then?
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
How long has this been going on?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
You're saying no.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
It's true.
This is very good for us.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The what?
Why would you do that?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
You mean I'm black?
No, just not the type.
But is she, has...
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
No.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
We offer...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Man, how many girls do you need?
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Do you know where she lives?
Half now, half later.
You don't drink?
No.
A friend.
Jesus.
He deals in pain.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
It's not quite the same thing.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
What makes you so sure?
Granville?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Where is he?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Hello?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Get out.
Yeah, sure.
It's just a name.
Hey man.
That's not true, Mr...?
What you got in mind?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
You ever play Chicken?
Com'on, tell me.
The guy who bought you that ring.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Was he with a girl?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Come again.
Your tree.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
How interesting.
Nice to meet you.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
You don't look eighty.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
I don't know.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Look at the stars.
Do you think there is any life up there?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
But why now?
Mother.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
Oh, is this your father?
Like a tea ceremony?
Just give me a rough estimate.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Harold?
You liked your teachers?
Then why did you leave?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Yes.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Parasite!
Oh yes. That's fine.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
You knew?
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
The box. I need the box.
What?
Who?
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Those things never work. Never.
No. Don't --
What was that??
Alone?
Goodnight, then.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
A brute.
We're leaving.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Don't look at me.
What happened to you?
Who?
Well?
Let me see.
So where's the harm?
I was here this afternoon.
No, damn you --
It smells damp.
You're still blaming me.
You're done worse.
I'll be down in a minute
Huh?
Plain soda?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
There's a first time for everything.
What's going on?
Of course. Every day.
Big house.
You like?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Is Julia here?
Are you O.K.?
It's like she's waiting for something.
I don't believe it.
Get the fuck out of here.
Where are you going?
We're on the Cointreau.
Oh no.
Steve. Thank God you came.
What did I say?
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
What's next?
Play it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
Well what about the new Echo --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Oh, hi.
What are you talking about?
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Hey Charlie.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
What's this?
Rob --!
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
What is this.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
Yeah.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Is it better?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Hi.
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Have you slept with him yet?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
I can't talk right now.
Want to know what, exactly?
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
I mean it.
Are you persuadable?
So?
What difference does it make?
Enough of what?
Are you okay?
Yes.  You?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
I'll call you.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
He'd want to know about all this.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
It's my birthday.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Jesus Christ.
Why not?
Where?
What will you do now?
Have you gone to the police?
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
Why are you here?
I see.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
He knows about you.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
That's insane.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You kill with your left hand?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What do you want from me?
What are you getting at, Moran?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Stop.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
This is madness!
How can I stop such a man?
And you?
I have no future husband.
Who?
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Who am I deceiving?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
It can be different.  It must be.
We must talk.
Your father must be smart.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
_Answer_ me.
How did you find me?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
He found us even there.
You're wrong.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
It doesn't.
Do you know what this is?
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
No. Roy. Roy V.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Where'd she go?
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Hello, Hildy!
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
You've had a better offer, eh?
Listen, Walter --
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
You're not afraid, are you?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
Now you got me.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
I'd like to think.
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Where's Bruce?
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Well -- what is it?
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
You grey-haired old Judas!
You got plenty of money?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
What?
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
What went off?
Where is he?
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
What?
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
I can't.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
You know it is!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Mother!
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
What good'll it do?
Hey --
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
But how do I know...?
Get the cops, somebody.
Baldwin -- his name is.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Yes.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You wouldn't.
Ask her yourself.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
I'm starting my own collection.
A bit too quick.
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Naturally.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
No Turks.
Has Sue got it right?
We don't know anything about it
Why didn't they say that before you started?
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yikes.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Cone.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
What?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
She's pretty cute.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Yeah, no shit.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
What was that?
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Should we stop?
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
And...
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So what?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
What was that?
A couple hours!
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
That's the understatement of the year.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
Just back up.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Hey.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Jesus Christ.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
French?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Is everything fine?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Oui.
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
That's not how he tells it.
Oui.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
I want to be the way I was before.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Won't he be able to tell?
Really?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
You are a therapist, right?
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
I don't know. Something.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
You are an animal.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
That's great.
Should I come with?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Ooka.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Boys just passing through?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
How?
All I want's the money.
How much do I owe you?
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Only when I work.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Thanks for the drink.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
What's that supposed to mean?
Fine.
Hey, Findley's here.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Get with what?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Oh yeah? Where?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Yeah, that's what I think.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Try me.
Fair.
You don't look like a college girl.
Hey!
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
Eggs. How do you like them?
Oh, cut my finger.
No, why should I? It's yours.
Do you want me to go?
What's this supposed to mean?
Who is it?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Thousand dollars a game.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
With them?
Yes.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Yes.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Please.
Son ... are you awake?
... and Rigel.
I had an awful dream.
What did he talk to you about?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Where, Jimmy?
What is it?
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
When?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Why, yes.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
What?
Just my luck, no ice.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Are you all right?
Love was never our problem.
You saved a lot of lives.
Can you believe this?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
I had a feeling you would.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
This is ridiculous.
No. Exotic.
Why did you people come here?
Air... water... your "sun."
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
My reputation precedes me.
May we go home now, please?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
How's the head?
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
It would make me very happy.
My room!
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
It is you Junior!
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
Look, can we discuss this later?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Those people are trying to kill us!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
That was a misunderstanding.
What you look at, Indy?
What does it mean, Indy?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Took what?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Indy! Help me!
Can you move your arm?
Couldn't keep away, huh?
WILLIE?!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
What're we going to do?!
And they don't even know what it really is.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Arrrgh!
Who was it?
Yes.
Why don't we go home?
Somebody's been here.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
You're gonna explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
No they won't.
Oh...Gooood!
Anyone there?
What's that?
What do I do?
I wouldn't say that.
It can't take that long.
They could put you back in the tube..
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
You gotta help.
What do you mean?
That's not a good idea.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
What do we do?
What about money?
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
The beach.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Now what?
I don't want to eat it.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
What do I do?
What happened?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
It's not your time. I get time off.
What do I do?
Follow her.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
Not sure at all.
Left...The one with the red dot.
Are you alright?
Never mind that, where are we now.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
What is your name?
What kind of a deal?
In him?
They have stolen state property.
It's just money.
Al Viola.
It is to me too.
What brings you here?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
I will?
What?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
The fresh tuna?..
Blake said that?
What's so funny?
What way?
It's not apparent.
And how'm I doing?
Hires you for what?
Wanted to get to know you.
What did you tell them?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
We figure out if it's in here.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What a mess.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
Now what?
Excuse me?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Yes.
This the only spare?
I heard them.
We gotta hook up.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No, I'm not...
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Debbie...
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Yeah?
Lowell?
I don't understand.
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
What's going on?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Thank you, Bob.
Yeah.
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah.
Hardly new news.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
What do you mean?
Thank you for saying that...
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Should I just take the documents now?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Yes.
Excuse me. Yeah...
They do this with impunity!
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
What?
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
It acts as a drug on the body?
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Excuse me?
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
What the hell is Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
No frown lines.  New watch?
Got any symptoms?
I have it.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
Yes?
What do you mean, was.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Not yet.
What does your lawyer think?
He wants a reconciliation.
What is it you're after, Miles?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Howard is a beautiful person.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Marylin? When did I say...?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
I want to be your -- your wife.
Yes.
But?
I have a surprise for you.
What do you want?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
You have to leave the house immediately!
I fell in love Miles.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Sweet.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
He was right, wasn't he?
She did a Harriman.
Do you know him?
Shit.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
What are they?
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yeah.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Ellie—
Ridiculous!
He doesn't think so much of you either.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
You talk as if—
Huh?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Yes.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Here, boy!
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Detectives!
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Not as long as I'm alive.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
I'm following you.
Yes.
This looks like the best spot.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Oh, Peter— 
I don't want it now.
was—but—
was so scared—that it scared—
What if nobody stops for us?
Oh, no!
Clever.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
You! Don't make me laugh.
What happened?
What'd you give him for the car?
Any luck?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
Same to you.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Eight o'clock tonight.
Mr. Gordon—
Joe, listen—
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
Then—you'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
What do you think, Lou?
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
But why?
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Then who killed the President?
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
There were admirals.
That's our case!
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Dad, look what I drew.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
...you heard echoes.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
They killed him, honey.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
How many men?
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Are they?  Why would they?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
...and your General?
His name?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Where is Banister in all this?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
That's all you've had all this time?
What are they?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
I'll call her.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Uh-huh.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
I found out.
You got a good lawyer?
She almost sounds scared.
She wants to go back to work.
She knows it's my case?
We are. Don't worry about it.
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Why does it need to be dark?
Was she helpful?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
Cash poor?
If you're having some.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
The Delfonics.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He told me last night.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Bigger?
Fifteen thousand.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
They seem to like the idea.
You think he's got a thing for you?
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Has he hinted around?
You know some interesting people.
What about you Max?
You're avoiding the question.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Which one?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I know.
If I don't cooperate?
What the fuck is that shit?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
I thought I did.
Where's the bag she gave you?
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
What were you two fighting about?
Thanks.
What do you think it is?
I just came here to talk.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
I don't know. One of your friends.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
How long?
It's a diet thing?
I thought you were sixteen.
Did you ever go I one?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Who's arm is that?
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
This one.
Okay.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
The moon -- I dunno
Who was that?
What did he do?
Sure.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Uh-huh.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
What?
Where's the rest of it?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
They don't have your winning personality.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Who's it for? A relative?
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Hey, Max.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
I'm alone.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
How'd you find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
She was afraid.
No.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Get me out of here.
Take me home.
Then what are you doing here?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
It's all been a dream.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Della?
Are you all right?
There's nothing to expose.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
It was the window.
Now what?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Not me, buddy.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
I can't relax.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
Thanks.  What's that?
Your kid dropped it off.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
Lemme see.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Where are we?
How high is that?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Help me! Help me!
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down.
What's going on?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Shows how much you knew.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Well that's good to know.
Clear the area. This is an order!
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
That black car?
What's goin' on Paul?
Who is?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
Oh God. I know. I know.
I don't know. I don't know.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
He's not part of the program.
What's that?
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Then what do we do?!
Hurry!
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Not a chance.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Jesus, God!
Kicker, anything?
Hey.
Okay, good tip.
Old woman?
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Kaboom.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
I'm gonna spew.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
What are you doing?
I'm just saying.
I don't know...sorry?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Am I in there?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Leave him behind!
Then open the doors!
What?!!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
More soldiers?
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Son! -- Out of the water now!
Did you bring a check?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
This is Matt Hooper...
The wire's showing!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Have you ever had one do this?
He's comin' up -- !
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Can you do that?
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
My kids were on that beach...
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
What happened?
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Wait a minute! I need you.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Look at him take it!
Do I set the goddam hook?
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
What's that supposed to prove?
I'm okay...
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
I don't think so.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
So that's cool with you, then?
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
You know it's okay.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
What is your job title, exactly?
Nails? Really?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
You don't know anything about me!
I'm a junior.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Blood and guts.
Yeah.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Oh.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
You know... it's parts...
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
The Wizard of Gore?
Cold feet.
Is Vanessa here?
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
But you're old!
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Is the baby okay?
What...
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Juno? What's going on?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Dad, no!
There are ads? For parents?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Hm.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
What would be a good time for you?
Are you takin' the pictures?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
Do what?
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Early, what're you doin'?
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Turkey mostly.
Tight fit.
Henry Lucas.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Could be.
How old you?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Yeah.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Did she suck your dick?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Where you goin' tonight?
What?
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Tonight?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
You know what I want to do?
Yeah.
Why is that?
Come dance.
Miss, would I be prying?
Yeah, I guess so.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Passion...
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yep.
And you don't get shit out of it.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
No. I was just kidding.
Hi mom.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
What do you mean, no?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Morpheus.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
How'd you get in here?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
What are you talking about?
You still having a problem with this?
A few people.
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
You're not going to tell me that.
Why her?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
What word did you leave last night?
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
I know where you are.
No problem.  We're in.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
What are you doing up?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Has he gotten through to any?
No prints.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
I'm busy right now.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
That's it?
A building?
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
It's a good play, but risky.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Do you?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I know you didn't
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Alright.  What about me?
It was.
I'm not playing a game now.
You've got to face the things you feel.
I'm hungry.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
I'm sure you are.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Lyssa ...
Take the western passage.
In the Arctic ice.
Does the Queen live?
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
There is nothing.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Yes.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
You're coming with us.
It is today?
Am I not worth returning to?
You too are lonely.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
You and I will guard the fire.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
I'm not hungry.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
You!
Would you desert your friends?
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
You had better manners as a pig.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
What news from our friends?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
Freylag's stronghold?
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A match for your son, I think.
A fine match.
You were attacked in the forest?
Modred! Impossible!
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Look.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
...Not at all.
Well, I don't need them...
It's incredible! How did you do it?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
...I'm going to kiss you.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
When I say I love you.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
I don't know... Five minutes.
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Yes?
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Messina.
It's impossible.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Mine.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
I know what you're getting at.
You have?
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
Walk with me?
What did they ask?
Why?
This guy's not a murderer.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
It has to be a full character's name.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Where?
Why know?
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
I do.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Coffee?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
What's up?
Are you serious.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
What do you mean?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Hi!
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
When?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Will you lighten up, please?
How'd this happen?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
No. I was in the shower.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
I'm sorry, but --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
You're not going up there.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What'd you do?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
God, that felt great!
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
The idiot speaks.
I know. He has it sent out.
I'm a bitch.
You're pawning The Rock?!
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Did she do that to you, too?
Neat.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
I can't.
Are you asking me on a date?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
How could this happen?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Neither.
I did?
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
Maybe she found him like that.
Your what?
You're beautiful.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
No, silly. I go here.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Thank you. Having fun?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Pink ones.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Where?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Why do you say that?
Why?!
What?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
We go out, smash 'em now?
Grotesque... monstrous...
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Protection?
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Who might these friends be?
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Faerie ring?
No... I... I need to rest.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Don't you know?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Damn them!
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Whatever for?
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Wait!
Will you chance a miss?
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Will you explain what's going on?
A good day for singing...
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
And did you?
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Aye... my Lord...
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Jack!
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?
My lady mocks me.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
I can't see a thing.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
I'd be honored.
Wondrously so.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
And as barren of love as stone.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
Sorry, Jack.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
In a dream.
What are you doing?
Dad's disappeared!
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
When does George get to come see his house?
Do you guys feel like painting?
What color?
Red.
You'd better call and cancel.
I'm going to bed.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
My mother would die.
You look better without make-up.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
I don't wanna go.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
A violation?
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
how much weight have you lost?
He buys and sells the world.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Forty.
She's out with a friend.
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
I forgot where I put my keys.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
To check up on me?
No one would blame me if I left!
I don't know.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
What would you like to be?
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
Good for you.
You should lock your doors.
What are you doing?
He never answers.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Four days.  I left to think.
Why call me?
Money?
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
What did I say?
You've never said that before.
Is your back still killing you?
No.  Mostly me.
I wasn't sure.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You can't go with me because of Sam?
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
All day again?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Dad's home, already?
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
She's alright, isn't she?
Why not?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Start your job? What kind of job?
Nothing.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Oooh...
Guess we better get going, huh?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
He's dead.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
What does that mean?
Forget it.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Back to New York for starters.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
You got your own nightclub?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I prefer bourbon.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Appreciate it.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Blacks welcome there?
You shouldn't have come here.
He's sick?
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
And he's dead serious.
And give you a good buzz.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Where did you meet my father?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
I didn't murder anybody
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
This is bad, Nicky.
No. This can't be happening.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Look who's back from the dead.
Come on. One more time.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
You gotta kill yourself.
You smell like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
If you want to.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
It's freezing my hands.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
No.
Why would you be floating?
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
It looks like the work of a brother...
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Where do you send them?
Answer the question!
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
I'm very smart.
No.  Just no.
Well then...?
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
I'm not armed.  Well?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Maybe you'll think of something...
I'd rather be with you.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
How will they know we're coming?
I'm afraid.
Don't ever let go.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
...But I still have the choice...?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
Hello, Sandman.
Hello.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
I have always been here...
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
More... many more.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't think so.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
They're comin' with us.
I'm, okay... You okay?
I like to remember things my own way.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?
Okay...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
He'll kill us.
So what do we do?
In pornos?
Set.
You killed him.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Okay. Thanks.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Where's Pete?
Did you ask him who he is?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
What is this, Rogoff?
Who is this man?
No.
What's your axe?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
I like to laugh, Fred.
It must be from a real estate agent.
Good book, huh?
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
What's that? Another tape?
We've got to call the police.
We will.
What was that?!!!
What job?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Give that a try.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Pornos?
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
It was weird...
Sheila...
Oh, read it!
All of it?
Found in Asia!
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Yes.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Where are they? Do you see them?
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
The police?
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Charming chap.
What are we going to do?
Huh?
No.
Leaving?
So there are others?
That's intelligent.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
When was all this?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Suppose she should leave it?
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Sondra Bizet.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
George, come back!
Why not? What's going to stop me?
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
I guess we're in for it.
In for what?
Yes.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Bump?
Why?
All right, I'll be there.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Helluva night, isn't it?
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
And what's this ... ?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Yeah, Kay?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Please, I want to go back...
Where are we going?
-- but he didn't.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Can you fake the cerebral output?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Go ahead.
Did he close the front door?
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
I need your help.
So?
I won!
It's a little late for that.
You're alive?
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I forgive you.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
You're not gonna kill me...
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You don't seem all that proud.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Why should I trust you?
How do I even know which one has it?
He just wanted a few minutes before --
How did you get this?
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
What?
Can't they shut that off?
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
He's trying to prove his innocence.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
You mean after he lost your son.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
When served warm --
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Thank you very much, sir.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
It's on West Broadway.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Bullshit.
What time is it there?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Goodbye, Bobby.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
Yeah.
So, when's the drop.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Heard of them.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Pshhh...
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
No.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yeah. Sure.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
What is it?
What's the plan?
No. Just the cross streets.
I'm on the phone.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
I will.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
Yeah.
You happy?
Put that shit out...
Did you hear what he just said?
You did?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Hey, boys.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
What?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Drinks are free, right?
Where do you live?
How do you know it's not drugs?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Is it nice?
No. What is it?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Edinburgh.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
It hit?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Where am I gonna start?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Why do you ask?
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
It will be rough.
I'll be away a lot.
What do you think?
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
I'm not made of glass.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Shhh!
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Get out.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
You the man.
The hell you are.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
[The what?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
Yes.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
You mean a misfire?
Did you like school, Creasy?
What are you doing?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
No.
You're late.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
That's not a question.
You think too much?
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
You got that right.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Jordan!
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
Yes, mom?
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
You helped him get this job.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
What for?
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
I don't think I remember him.
It's her baby too, you know.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
No...
I'd like that very much.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Put on your blue suit...
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy...
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Hospital.
Back home.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Y'all mind the store.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
So long, Ho-Jon.
We got to stop them right here.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Any time. Whenever we want.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
People will talk.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
You betcher ass, Dad.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
You're an attractive man.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
You're leaving tomorrow?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Why would he do that?
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They missed the boat.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Damn.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Huh?
Against what?
Against anything. Just protest.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
About me?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Did you write this?
Yes, sir.
A hundred dollars!
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
John Doe.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Had any schooling?
Did you find her?
What do they want?
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
The heelots!
The heelots!
Sure. Mostly often.
St-rike!
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Is there anything wrong?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
What?
SWAT wants to go in.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
What happened? Is there a problem?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Where did you find an old recording like that?
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Am I gettin' the car?
What?!
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
You can't kill me like this.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
How do you feel after a shooting.
Recruited you from where?
How did you like Toronto?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
I think I can handle that one.
I'm not good at lying.
What's the first commandment?
Why?
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
I'm just practicing my lying.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
About six years. My partner took me.
There's your answer. He's smart.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Have you evacuated anyone?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
What do you want from me?
You think I didn't need you?
Mmm, needs a little something.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
When?
How's Paco doing?
There is?
Stay here, don't move.
...the hell are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Roper.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
Repoed this morning.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
Who's running it!
What have you promised them?
What do you want?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
What do you need?
What's happening?
Dream?!
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
The maze has been changed --
That's right.
What brings you inside?
Someone you have to get back to?
It was a test.
I'm sorry.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Voice activate.
Access granted.  Male or female?
Male.
Standard, modern, upscale --
I heard that!
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
... Nothing.
Just shut your gap!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
NINJA APE ZORD!
The goddamned bastards.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Are you frightened?
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Who hired the bastard?
The deal's too good, Frankie
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Luciano.
Something came up.
Charlie?
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
I'll handle the Boss.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
How soon can we pull this off?
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
You gotta plan these things.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
I've got friends.
He's an animal!
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
We must be friends, Charlie.
The terms will be mine.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Luciano is dead?
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Uhh - martini?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
You're really gonna pop the question?
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
When'd you get in?
The ring...
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Don't ask where I got it.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
I see.  How much?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Huh?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Will you go chase an ambulance!
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Did you like the first act?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Aw--
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
I did. What about it?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Washington!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Please, sir!--come with me!
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
A *day*!
What's that?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
He did?
No.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
No!
No! Stop it!
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
In Terry Canyon?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Yay!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
A camp! Well!
Then you *did* say it.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Chick--
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
I know that.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
What do you mean?
He's lost complete faith in me--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
It's crucifying him--!
Mr. President...
Will the Senator yield?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Oh, yes.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
But they did take place?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Tell me more about yourself.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
What did they say?
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Oh, that—
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Good night.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Huh?
With pay!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
Boy, was he burning.
John—
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Yes, sir.
Sit over there, will you?
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Newspaperman?
You can't?
Yes.
How do you do.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Uh-huh.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution—
Uh-huh.
Mrs. Semple?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
No, I mean - about my client.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
What is your name?
Farmer?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Is she home?
Tails tonight, sir?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
But you do therapy?
Ernest, what do you think?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
What brought this on?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Althea hasn't told you?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
Yes, your honor.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
You like me. How come?
Doc...
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
No, I really don't.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Is that like a party trick?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I'm glad.
I think so.
What was that?
Transference!
I guess you saw the show...?
But...
You got off easy.
Weekly or monthly?
What happened today?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Uh-huh.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
I can tell you anything else.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Things got a lot worse.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
I guess that makes sense.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
You lie.
What are you doing here?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Can you swim?
The things that get you excited.
Jonathan?
Yes?
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Juicy?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Where's my gun?
You did not!?... We're not!?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
Really?
When was that?
Much less go outside.
Atta, girl!
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Yes!
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
They always call the great ones nuts.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Are you an actress?
Who?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Roy.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
What?
Bye. 
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
My heart died a long time ago.
But there's still only six of us.
So why don't you just tell her!
So you're chicken?
Maybe she's right.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Sounds good.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Where am I going?
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Why are you carrying the dog?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Oh...?
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Yes, I am, sir.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Yes.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Will you be joining us, soon?
Yes.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
Certainly.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
Yes, I wrote it.
Do you know what you're saying?
You could hear them?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
We have a treaty with Austria.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
I can't taste nothing.
How can they do this?
What's the matter?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Karla.
Hello, remember me?
You did all this for me?
It's locked.
Delivery!
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Nice neighborhood, huh?
It's alright.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Tape his mouth shut.
What you say?
Get on.
Just do it.
Debo!  Debo!
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
My back.
Elroy, what happen?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I have a problem.
Ah.
I remember you...in the elevator.
You were very nervous.
Can we go now?
Come with us, sir.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
You killed him.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
Don't you threaten me.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Can we go now?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
I promise.
No...kisses to you.
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
What?
Then why'd you drag me into it?
What am I supposed to say to her?
Well?
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Gimme a dollar.
Everybody does?
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
Why?
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Keep your eyes peeled.
Come Back.
Put her on.
No, Ben.
I'll bet.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Yes! Yes!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What?
What could have possessed that girl!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Amen.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Hm?
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Up river.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
What's your name?
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
O no! Your turn!
What's their names?
How's that?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Harry!
I was praying.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
Worked like a charm.
Haven't slept, have you?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Much better.
My dream.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Decide to take a day off after all?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
You okay?
And then what happened?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Jungle man fix Jane.
Well, here are fifty francs.
You should be more careful, Anna.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
What do you wear in the morning?
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
And there?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
You didn't get legal advice?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Good morning, Your Highness.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
We can wait.
It's a real Paris reunion.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
But you had!
I must get into that country of yours!
What for... why?
Me?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
In other words you don't know.
That's a strange angle.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
That is correct.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
You know I want to...
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Not funny, huh?
Yes.
Anything, Ninotchka.
Did you make any change in this room?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
Go on.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
What, darling?
Comrades! Good people of France!
Yes... a little white house.
They belong to the people.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
What does he say?
Huh?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Thank you.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
What is this, Swana?
She's gone, Leon.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
What?
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Where are they?
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
May I ask why?
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Where the hell is he?
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
To protect his people.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
It's a code or something.
Yeah?
This is not a joke, John!
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
The country's loving it.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
What's Liddy got?
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
I did?
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
How is this national security?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
We really must go, Mr. President.
What?
Sir?
What about the documents he promised?
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Winning?
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
Kissinger?
Where'd you find him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
No, Henry.  I don't.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
I like jazz ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Bernstein.
Sir?
What's in there?
I'll concede in the morning.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Buddy? ...
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Because ... I have to relax.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
When?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
What?
Whatcha mean by that?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
Some say you are, Rocky.
Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
When did he die?
No ID in her room?
Uh-huh.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
We goin' in?
Believe you're right.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Okay.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
What do you think.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
No.
I ain't got the money.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Why would we go to Odessa?
I know something better.
Is Llewelyn there?
Airport.
...I know where you are.
No. Do you?
This. And the gas.
You married into it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
How's that?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Tent poles.
The kind with the most poles.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Another additional.
What else then?
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
...But that won't last.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
How would you describe him?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not any way.
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
What about it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
...I... I know what you are.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
I am?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
No, Del.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Ad lib?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
What're you doing here, Roy?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You're in serious danger!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
No. Loma Vista.
Dr. David Ravell.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
No, that should be more than --
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
I don't follow...
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
I... I don't know...
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
What 'look'?
It's not here. Let's go.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Like... us?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Isn't that the point?
Jesus Christ!
What the hell's going on?
Yeah? The sport utility?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Yeah?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
That's right!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
In any state.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Now Penny, stop that!
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
That's good, honey.
You said -
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
She's at the five and dime.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Hi, Byron.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Why?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Yes, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
Yes, sir!!
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Is your brother a flyer?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
He didn't give you much choice.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
You're better than candy.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
That was great.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
God.
Does it still hurt?
Are those for me?
No. Is that what you want?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
One.  Squeeze.
You got an idea?
They're not supposed to be here!
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
She's never coming out.
Hey.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
We're leaving.
478...
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Shaky?
Got him!
Stop it.
I'm sorry.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Huh uh.
What if I spazz out?
No...
Lemme see that rifle son...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
So... we understand each other Judge?
Hey... what the hell you doing?
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Are you finished?
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Huey man I got to talk with you...
I don't know.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Yeah, I do.
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Rose?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
You call that a compliment?
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Excuse me?
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
If I fail, you fail.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Father?
What?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Go on.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
I stand corrected.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
Thirteen years...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
One of yours?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Long time.
Goodbye, Francis.
Not yet, Thomas.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Is he really all right?
Yeah, sure.
Was it Pascow?
Not at all.
Not yet...how much further is it?
I can hardly read these.
I'm not climbing that.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Shit! Look at this mess!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
That's forgotten.
You better get going, hon.
You stole my boat.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
I'll torture it out of you.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Now?
Can I trust you?
It's a pirate medallion.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
It doesn't!
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Exactly.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Move!
Somewhat.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
You haven't seen it.
He may be.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
But --
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
What are you going to do to him?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Like rotting meat.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Considering what?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
You don't want this.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Yes?
When did you...?
Is that so?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Mouse?  What mouse?
What do these replicators do to people?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
That's going to fit me?
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
Where is it?
You're not going after Argon!
Oh yes you are!
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
You have the cutest nose I've—
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Anne, come here. Listen—
Are you crazy?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I see.
Your house?
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
You're the Tribune man?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
I bring a message from Garcia.
Yeah - go on.
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Come on, get going, get going!
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Not on my own beat, no.
Well, when are you quitting?
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Is that so?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
I bet.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
How far have you gotten?
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
What could I be?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Surely, come right in.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
We just thought that—
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
I beg your pardon?
Heavens! The man's insane!
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Yes sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
A bird in a gilded cage?
What?
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Thank you.
Where'd you get this?
Bud brought it to me.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Sure you are.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
Oh, no thanks ...
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
No. Of course not.
What happened?
Well--it was dark out ...
What do you mean!?
Get lost!
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
He won't notice anyway.
Jen please ...
What's wrong?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
I can't.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
I'm so glad you're here.
Yes.
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Why?
Yeah ...
Hey.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
So you can't talk to me?
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
What city?
Somewhere in Utah.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I know.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Yeah I can't.
Hey. What are you doing?
Hi, is this Jack?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Uh-huh.
I know but I....how much is it?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Hello?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Not very well.
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
You were talking about the promotion --
No I didn't say that.
Is everything ok?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Did something happen; are you alright?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
If you come to Hawaii --
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
Yeah.
I think maybe over a hundred.
What is this?
Yeah.
No.
What's that for?
That's that.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
It's alright.
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
You have an ATM?
I'm sorry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
I know.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
When can you leave?
Put him through.
Just tell him to call me.
No.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
What on earth would that require?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
You're a sentimental man.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
As for the author... shoot him.
Quite.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
What have they done to you now?
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I pray you: be succinct.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Uh-huh
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Why is that, Louis?
I will not have this in my home.
I just want to understand--
I don't want you to--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
He personally asked you to?
Showing life
Like a bug.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Sorry to disappoint.
Fuck you--
It doesn't have to be
He'll destroy us.
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
I don't give a shit about-
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
I know what you want but it can't be done!
They wanna talk to you.
About what?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
This looks done.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Who's that?
Whadda you care?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You wasn't with her?
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
What do you mean?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Whadda ya mean?
Does that mean...
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Should I hit it?
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Now take the rest off.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
But, Jake, I was just...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
I'm not interested in him.
Yeah, what?
All I did...
I went out.
I called. You weren't there.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
You did?
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
The kids are sleeping.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
He has it. Thank you.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
You think I made all this up?
His wife took a trip.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
What time?
Who left -- where?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Ever get an answer?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
But I'm not a killer!
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
I told you that --
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Hello.
I don't know what you mean.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
How much do you think you'll need?
Ten here.
Something big going on somewhere?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
I wish there was one I wanted.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
Tell me about it.
What do you think?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
It doesn't make sense to me.
That's what the witnesses told him.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
I have the whole weekend off.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Do you like it?
What?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
No.
Mother--
You make any sandwiches?
You awake?
Go ahead.
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
I was talking to Jim.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Come back tomorrow.
I'll wait for him.
What's your name!
I just don't want trouble.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
It's me!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Plato?
No.  At dawn.
Why?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Why?
Mom--I'm not--
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Chicken?
Okay--
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Now that's true!
"Life is crushing in on me."
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Yeah--why--
The kids take me.
Goodbye!  See you!
They'll be looking for you.
It doesn't matter to them.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I'm never going back.
Why?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
We have to go back!
Yes.  My best friend.
What's he like?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
That one?
What?
Didn't you forget something?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Gabriel -- !
Must have a way with stationery.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
I've been doing good, though.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
One more. Smile. One more.
Tell me again.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
...the truck driver...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
You're not hearing me here --
Nick, please, it's me --
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
No --
So you could get with my sister.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Hey, it's... been two years --
What the fuck are you talking about.
We walked the place for a week.
Rather be back in the Mountain?
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
No way.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I can't go back to Vegas...
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
You want that for here or to go?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Yeah.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
I'm just talking.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
GUARD!!!
YOU TELL HER!
POP! That was My card!
Daddy, did ya see that?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Me and Mr. White?
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
But what is this?
Just hold on buddy boy.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Give me my book.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
What's she doin' now?
What for?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Nope.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
For what, the cops?
You didn't ask.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Dead.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
We can't take him to a hospital.
Why!
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Hold on.
Coffee?
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
I'll make the soap myself.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
All my clothes --
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
So did I. They were in it.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
And meet him there.
Why?
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Kind of sore.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Just a thing I was workin' on.
What's the matter -- restless?
Yes, people make me restless.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Maybe I better start working on him.
We might as well start a fire.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
We got to get movin'.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Aren't we stayin'?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
No.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Hey, Brenda.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Help!
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
So, I guess I can go now.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
What about you, Buddy?
Feel that?
Listen to me I --
Oh.
It's okay.
Where's Shorty?
Hanson, please.
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
What are you getting at, Professor?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Saw who?!
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Professor, I think you should see this.
Thanks, handyman.
How is she?
Because she will lie?
Father, I think you should rest.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
It says, "Ray."
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Hi, Mom.
MURDERED?!!
Because it's the rules!
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Don't I get a kiss?
Don't wake the kids...
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
I do, please.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I'd like to get out of here.
How much does she want?
I ought to know.
What did she want?
Nothing.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
But you have treated me that way.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -— you know that?
Yes.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
Dr. Judd?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
I didn't know.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
This food is excellent.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
What?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
You went out with her?
What about sex?
Like what?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
I have money.
Tell me your name.
Yes.
Is he going to see this?
Yes.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
No.
So you do fantasize?
About who?
I fantasized about you.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
And now you can?
Don't you get lonely?
And you feel the same way with John?
No, you're not.
God, I m so mad at him!!
You're really never going to make love again?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
But I don't understand --
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
I can't tell you like this.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
I want to touch you.
Well, are you?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Always the lawyer.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
You son of a bitch!!
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
No, I didn't.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Yeah, so?
I take it you've never masturbated?
No, I haven't.
Is he still at your house?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Why?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, I wonder why.
I have a pretty good idea.
Let me talk to him first.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
I don't want to talk about it.
He just asked me questions.
Questions about sex.
What!?
Because I wanted to.
You couldn't do it, period.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
Thank you.
I get real busy between two and four.
Bye.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Then what happened?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
No? Not even one more?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
I'm intrigued.
John Millaney.
Right now.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
Nothing wrong with trying.
I just... Ann is very...
You trust him.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
You knew these people?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Kiss, kiss?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Well? Supper at my place?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Where is he now? Do you know?
What do you want to call me at the office for?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Want me to breathe deeply?
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
BREAKING OUT
A wreck.
Fools!
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Absolutely correct.
Poor Brad.
Why?
I'm...happy.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
BRAD!
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Bottle.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
I can't help the traffic.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yeah.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Let me call Christine.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Whoa.
It does. Feels right.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Perfect.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nope.
Been checking your messages?
What?
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Me?
Want me to drive?
What's wrong?
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Nice. Very nice.
How long have you been into wine?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
So what's your novel about?
Oh. You mean... today?
Well...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Okay. See you around.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Okay.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
About a year.
You golf?
See you, Miles. You take care.
Stephanie! Stop!
Houdini's sick.
There's dust in it.
This one?
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
It tastes funny.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I'm scared.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
I see.
Explain, act crazy?
Are you going to do this or what?
It was very dark.
It's noise.
Do you think it's a possibility?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
This is going to do nothing.
They're distracting us?
Yes.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
I'm getting out now.
Morgan?
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Don't call me Father.
What about them?
Is anything missing?
Is that him?
No money, eh?
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
Emmett.
Forget it.
They've been kind to me.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Ten A.M.
Jefferson City?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
What's Turley like?
Women?
I understand.
It's not going to be easy.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
I'll see you around.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
You wanted to see me?
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
What's all this then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
It's none of your business.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
What brings you into my saloon?
You work here?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
What do you mean?
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
Okay -- for you.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Viktor, it's my studio.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Even the fall from the plane?
Simone does not control my destiny.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Not if I don't let her.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
What?... What did you say?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
For her?
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I've seen them all before.
I need flesh and --
Hi, Dad.
Your mother couldn't make it?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
Okay, Dad.
One thing bothered me.
Good-night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Nice boat, Taransky.
The background is.
-- I bet you have.
Abduction?
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Hi.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Maybe he can.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
I forgot your name.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
Something I want?
I didn't know you were funny.
Yes.
No.
Yes?
I don't know.
I told you what I want.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Meaning?
Superstition.
Chicken blood on the crops.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
See?
Slut.
Someone actually... employs you?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Hey. Fuck you.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
He means moon shining.
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
This is his room... isn't it?
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Wait a minute --
I almost thought for a second...
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
-- Where have you two been?
What?
What you up to?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
What are you doing?!
It's my nature.
What's she see in that douchebag?
He's a fucking Martian?!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Sorry.
I got to leave my post.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Meat.
What can I do you for?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Flip.
Where'd he go?
Praise Jesus.
You.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Driving?
You have a great profile.
Well?
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
What kind of a guy is he?
I'll do it.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
I hate to say I told you so.
Bandit I, do you copy?
What does the old Timex say?
Bandit?
Do I have a choice?
I'm at marker eight-five.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Go breaker.
Go head on, breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
I think you're just yellow.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
What about the sheriff's task force?
Maroon uniforms?
Uh, yeah.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Are you on a land line?
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah, I can front this.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Yeah... Sid?
So how we lookin'?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
You love her?
For real?
Like a mafucka.
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
What else did Padiche say?
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
What do you want?
I can trust Rheya.
What happened to Gibarian?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
No, she won't.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
How quickly?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
Will she come back?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
No.
Human beings can die.
What do you want?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
We're taking a flight?
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
What do you mean?
What does Snow think you should do?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
It's all right.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Thank you.
You're lying.
I want to stop taking those pills.
You want it coming back with us?
Hi.
Uh...
What did he say?
Could be, I guess.
Yeah.
Claire?
Let go!
What do you want to do?
Where?
They guys treatin' you all right?
"For"...?
You don't have to, now.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
I think -- she's crazy.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Did you hear what I said?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
What're you talking about --
What did you do tonight?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
... Hard?
You should'a brought the girl.
How do I know that's her?
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
How do you know where the gun is?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
No…not really.
See?
Lizzy!
I know.  I've got one too.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
How are you doing, kid?
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
How about tomorrow?
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Just call me Spidey.
Some things you should say anyway.
Good morning, Liz.
Uh is a good start.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
I've gotta study.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Any sign of our friend?
I am old enough to--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
I will finish what I've begun…
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Actually, I got this spider bite…
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
Up here, Docky Ocky!
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all good Nazis?
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Any news on Dunbar?
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
You make my mouth water.
Not you.
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
What's the award?
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
Do Grable.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
What are we going to do with him?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Ich weiss alles.
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
That's where he's going.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Yes, where would you go?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Antonia?
Oh
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
Keep her together until I get back.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
No, sir.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Understood. That will be all.
The thought had crossed my mind.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Calm yourself, Bones.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Underground deposit?
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Later. Let's go...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
Logic indicates that is the case.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Why?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
What happened...?
You would have done the same for me.
Yes, yes, Spock...
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Where's Doctor McCoy?
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
No.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
He asked you not to grieve...
... Spock...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
You're not going in there -- !
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Uh -- what are they?
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
And who am I hiding from?
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Wait --
You did this -- in a day?!
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
He's on a build up to detonation!
Let go -- he can't -- !
No!
Well?
Tactical!
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Scotty -- what's left?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
<u>WHAT</u>?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
That was close --
All stop, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Sir, you did it.
Fire all phasers...!
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Bones --
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
"Neutralized?" How?
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
How soon?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Memory problems, too.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Steady, now. We need your help.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You tricked me.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
Surely you can be more specific...
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
I'll have to re-energize.
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Transparent aluminum?
Father...?
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Will it?
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really.
Why not...?
No... I want to stay with you...
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Yes... that looks like them.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
It is not over.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
What kind of concerns?
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Fail-safe?
Implants bothering you?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Full impulse.
Will that stop the tear?
That's your expert opinion?
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Captain...
Scanners are off line!
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
... Population three hundred million...
What are they interested in...?
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
What you're doing to my neck...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Yes...
Are you saying they won't help us?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
You think they're still up there?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Can you configure it?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Did you know her?
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Ready to make a little history?
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
Captain, the Enterprise!
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Great name. French?
The invasion plans.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
You're lying.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Port battery, ready sir!
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Report.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
We were until your torpedoes!
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
You were demoted...
Well, I -
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
An accident wasn't good enough...
We don't get many presidential assassins.
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
WE SURRENDER.
A lie?
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Direct hit -
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
That could take hours!
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
This one can.
- could take weeks, sir.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Do you know who I am?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
For how long?
Beverly, come in.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
It'll only work for one of us.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Why is it moving?
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
Counselor.
Imzadi. This is so good.
Cannon fodder.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
What programs were accessed?
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.

I won't do it.
We're being hailed.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
What's this?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Anything.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
How did you end up on Remus?
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Were we always explorers?
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
We are.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
My God...
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
What?!
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Sure.
What was your last stop?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
It's taken on a disguise.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Mrs. Haydn...
Steering wheel.
Eh... police.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Pancakes.
Smile.
No gas.
My... husband.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
I want to try it.
What?
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
No.
Why?
The driver will...
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Well... I'm going to go now.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I don't understand 'friend.'
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
What is hell?
I do not want to.
I am not a good singer.
You can have one.
Are you angry at me?
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
You promised.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Good morning.
Yes, they are.
But...
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
What for?
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Help me!!
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Was there visual contact?
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Maybe.
Damn right.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Sounds good.
What?  Right Here?
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
So've I.  Too much.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
You just did.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Naawww.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Sleaze to peddle.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
That would be no.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
I guess.
Got your ticket?
Take it to him.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Testa?
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
This isn't in our database?
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Excuse me?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Another what?
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
How long have you been downtown?
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
There are Agency regulations about this.
What did you tell him?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
You knew it was me all along?
I already have an employer.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
I don't think you understand.
You should call your Grandmother.
What do you drive?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Nikki.
Hi.
Hi.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Anything.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
...and even then...
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Oh my God.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Hello?
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
How's it going? It's been a while...
How are you doing?
What kind of things?
Why didn't you call?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
I mean, I need the money.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, that's dumb.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
You miss the pain?
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
What are they doing here?
Mike?
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
What?
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Wake up, baby.
They're all skanks.
She smiled baby.
It doesn't matter...
We're gonna get laid, baby.
Thanks for clarifying that.
She smiled, baby.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Whatever.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I just need some time...
He drives a carriage.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
What are you doing?
Please, don't mess with me right now...
What the fuck..?
They're a finesse team...
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...You're just poking at it...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
It's on...
Good.  He never doubted you.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
What's the matter, Carlo?
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
Is it necessary?
What was this for?
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Godfather, you understand everything.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
How do you know I come from America?
Is the hospital covered?
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We should hear what they have to say.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Did he give you his politicians?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
How's Mom?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Is that good?
What? What?
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
What? What's this?
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
Could we sail to Venice?
I have to go to Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
Do you have any brothers?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
Why?
So tell me.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
What are you doing?
Who is it?
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Frances?
Is he really not here?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
What?
Where does Dickie live?
Very.
He's having an early night.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I don't believe you.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Randall.
How did you know that?
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
It's okay.
That's good, isn't it?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Do you want me to stick around?
It's okay.
Tom, are you okay?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was who Meredith?
Or Tom and Peter even.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
And don't forget. I have the key.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiancée...?
A few days ago.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
How much for everything.
Is there a firing range around?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
I can believe that.
Really?
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
What did you do?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
What hours do you work?
You must be rich.
But this is a porno movie.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
No, why?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
What is it? I'm busy.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Well... I guess so.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
Iris.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
I don't remember.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
He looks like a killer.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
No.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
There's porno theatres for that.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Education?
Military record?
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Why do you ask?
I'm no cop.
I'm here to see Iris.
What's the action around?
Wiz?
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Yeah.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Maybe.  Not really.
Wrong.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
What about you, Delly?
I wish you were coming with me.
I think  it's worse  now.
What.
You look... different.
City hall?
How'd they get it inside?
I'm sorry.
They're not bad.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Yes it does.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Yes.
No.  But...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
We've been closed for a while.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
I'm here.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sandra Sinclair.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Here, one of mine.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
Evening, Luke.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
Exactly.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Exactly.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
No.
I thought you...
Ancestors?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Cathy?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Thank you.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I suspected as much.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
She already has a daughter.
I see.
I did.
And the second?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Don't you like us?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
See where I'm pointing?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
The little Brenner girl?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
Lovebirds, I see.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
How long have you known her?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
That's a chance we have to take.
But they'll be back.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
I started to say... inside...
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
And if you don't?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
What?
I understand completely, sir.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I don't know you.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What kind of law?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
We... we went to school together. College.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
What did it say?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Yes, but...
Yes, I was lying.
I'd still like to see you.
It is for me.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Take wing!
It was like that yesterday.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
The town looks clear.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
How soon?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Birds?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
I haven't finished my drink.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I fear he may have to.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
Well --
Gray killed her.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
I want it --
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
Get out of here!
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
I have other means of sustenance.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
You and I should work together.
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Was that it? Well, ok.
Think maybe knives do?
Fuck! What do you want?
What did they give you?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
I was a friend of your sister's.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
Erin. Who?
You know.
They botched the execution.
Could say that.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
You mean Alex.
But you, you've had them.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Erin!
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
You're in with them.
I don't believe you.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
No -- not at all.
Yes.
Hi Mom!
Of course, dear.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Tell me what?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
No -- I'm afraid not.
All right.
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
You must have come a long way.
The present situation?
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Thank you... Have you any news?
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
I -- I thought you were--
You mean he has the power of life and death?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
They would have killed this man?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Time to activate Plan B.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Death to all vampires!
We still going?
Don't!  Stop!
Where's Star, David?!
Where you going?
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
David.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I like Michael.
Still mad at me?
Michael, are you still in bed?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
But, Mom...
I'm really sorry, Max.
Star.
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
I know, I've felt it...
You've got to put this on.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Where these tracks headed?
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
What you doin'?
Too damn dangerous.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Let's open it.
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
Where's the other half?
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
What clothes?
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Neither will we.
Would that test have worked?
A couple of hours.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
After all this mess then.
You reach anybody yet?
How long's it been?
We going to make it?
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
Then we go after him.
So what do you make of it?
He's one of them.
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
What are you?
So, do we go on?
What's it all for?
Why did they built it?
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
How do you control the Morlocks?
How?
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
What?
Say I just come back again?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
We took a walk three days ago.
Heavens, look at that now!
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
For God's Sake, David --
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Sir...?
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Oh, that explains everything.
Why not?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Thank you.
The mud carriers.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Yes.
Someone you loved very much.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Yes, sir, he --
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
I am the oldest.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
We'll see about that.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
In where?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
Did you know my father?
We're late.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
[Beat] You bled to death.
What?
I know.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
How long do we have?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
William, you're not making sense.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
No, he didn't.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
You gotta stop thinking like that.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.
What case?
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Who told you this?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
What were you talking about the other day?
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
[Beat] How do you know?
Becker does? Are you sure?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
[Beat] Why?
This is a great song.
I'm sorry.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
You want anything special for dinner?
Honey?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Why?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
I've been better.
You girls are in some hot water.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Armed robber.
A .38.
Good God.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Oh shit.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
What?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Maybe.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Oh my God.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Thelma.
Why not?!
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
What?
You do?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
No.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
What?!  What d'you think?!
You too, sweetie, the best.
Where?!
God!  It looks like the Army!
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Say you're sorry.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
He implied it.
It must be great with a wife like that.
You're kidding? What did they say?
No You mean...?
Check.
Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
So... I see you made the news.
Here's the info you asked for.
Thanks.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
By the way, what's your name?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
That sounds like fun.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
So...
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Fuck!!
Are you okay?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Any idea where I might start looking?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Uh, that's okay.
Miami?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Four.
You little fuck.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
How do you guarantee that?
I can live with those reflections.
What's that supposed to mean?
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
What's a mook?
I don't watch the new ones.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Why?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
What's up?
What...?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Ted, are you okay?
By the way, how's he doing?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Hey.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Twenty-two.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Hey.
Eh.
Uh-huh.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
The other thing is...
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Oh, still sore about this.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
Secretary of Defense...
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
I don't want to listen to this again.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
What are you doing?
What's this about?
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Were you in Nam?
I did.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
I got one up on ya.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Alright. Alright...
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Jesus, you alright?
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
He knows me?
So what?
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Cuz I'm a skin?
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
What do you mean?
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
This Clear Moon's house?
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
You take care.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
X22. Read.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
You ever try solitary confinement?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
No way. No fuckin' way.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
That's all!
I saw one.
Yes, ma'am.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
It never came up.
I can't.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
I'm different.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You ever think about killing another human being?
Where?
...they say you're alright.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Who's gonna win?
Well... What   is   it?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Sir?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
What do you want?
On what?
Who's your pilot?
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
What the hell is this?
Time to go.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
Figured it out yet?
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
You didn't help.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
How'd you find me?
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
He had help.  From our side, sir.
I'm with an very important client.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
They found us!  Everybody out!
I want that fucker dead.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
Implanted.
I suppose you're not here either.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
How real does it seem?
All right.
I give up.
Go on.
Don't be ridiculous.
I thought you didn't like me.
So you dropped by to apologize?
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
The one in the mine!
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
What the hell is that, anyway?
Cannon fuse.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
So long, cactus!
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
Son of a bitch!
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Use the fucking bomb!
What?
You are so full of shit...
Down, honey, down.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Yeah, geography.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
What's it doing?
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
I have to talk to your brother.
Objection.
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
You can't remember that -- !
Not at all --
You see that? You wanna be like that?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
-- a speed manufacturer --
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
I feel much better now.
A fucking wheelchair?
1530 Rivington Street.
So what're we gonna do?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
What's Art Esparza?
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Murder witness.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
That's right.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
You tell me, man.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
I'd l-like to answer the question.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
This and that.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
And its purpose?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
CIA?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
The stuff we got last night.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Was there an argument?
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
OK, Gordon.
HE'S GONE.
Anything else?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And neither will I.
Where is the ring?
The later events have never been kept a secret.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
A blue rose.
I see. He does talk loud.
Accidental?
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
The usual, 9:15.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
But I love you, Laura.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Fill 'er up.
I already made you two tapes.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
You know it and I know it.
You'd think so.
Where's Dad?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Fine.
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
No.
I know of him.
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Mr. Concannon...?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
And what did your team do...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
...What difference would...
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Why is that?
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Right. Who called?
Her doctors killed her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Yes...
Yes.
What did she say?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
Really. How wonderful for you.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
It's over!
Mr. Alito, please.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I can't guarantee that...
From the magazine?
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
No.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...I know. I went...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Yeah.
What do you want?
I'm going to help her.
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Been a long time, huh...?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
That's right.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
She did?
...of the procedures...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Huh.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
What was it like?
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Right.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
We will, sir!
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
What'll we say to 'em?
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
And I...I've got other things happening.
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Just be careful, okay?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Right 'cross the freeway.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
What...happened?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Freddy, for all I know.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
What's that?
It can be captured, sometimes.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Did we lose anybody?
Yes sir.
How old are you, son?
Fifteen.
Albatross?
Feels different doesn't it?
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Why then.
What's the difference?
Yes.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
My dad.
What are they doing?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Of what?
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
And, of course, we are.
Yes sir.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
That's enough.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
I couldn't do it.
They tell you that?
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
It's outta here!
Swing up, son.
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
Yes.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
You heard from Reggie?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
No sir...
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
What happened on the charges?
The Good Witch...
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
In what capacity?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
Come look at this.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Huh?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
You got me, peanut.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
You think he saw us?
Who knows, baby?
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
More'n likely.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
Trust me on it.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
One bad car accident...
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
And no AC.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Sailor? You know what?
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
You must be my son.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
What if I asked you not to?
Oh God! What does that mean?
Have it your way... But you want it.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Simple? Kill him? How?
Yes.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Emily?
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
You're stoned.
He said something about being between things.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
So modest.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
Crabtree.
Who do you think it is?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
So whose car is it?
...we find the jacket.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Came to my senses.
Do you know he won't expel him?
You driving this car?
It's mine.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who the hell is that?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Well...
It's colder in there.
Is that really it?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I had to. Didn't I?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
Want me to get that?
Yes.
Afraid so.
That's a big book you're writing.
How's that?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Glaucoma?
Kinship. And what's here?
I just wanted a little sip.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
You're lying.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
No thanks.
That strikes me as odd.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Emily left me this morning.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
And the jacket?
Someone stole my car.
I'm through improvising.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Does he still love you?
Why yes. How did you know?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Grady?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Do you get high, Sam?
I was thinking of you.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
That's weird.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Is it because of Anna?
The birthday party.
No thanks.
Next week? The week after?
You don't have to tell me this.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
What are you looking at?
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
I don't like starlings.
I can't.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
See anything interesting?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
I would.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
What's with the boxes?
And your new apartment?
Why's that?
No you're not.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Your daddy will always love you.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Yes?
No.
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
No way.
That's right.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
We have a few more minutes.
You couldn't say.
Do you know what "normal" is?
I don't.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
Go home, Walter.
When did it all start?
Why?
To relax.
And what are you doing?
I was six years old!
It's going to take time, Walter.
Want a ride?
Me?
Very weird.
Neither do you.
Southern light.
You think I have a problem?
Did I say something wrong?
The worst?
What did you do to them?
You mean the time you're locked away?
All three -- in chronological order.
No you don't.
You never asked them about it?
You're scared.
I'm not scared.
I've got problems.
Sneak up behind me like that.
Do you want to talk about it?
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
I'm taking you back out.
Fine.  Be that way.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
What about O-2?
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
I think it likes you.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
How deep?
Hey!
He can still make it.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Which one shall I wear?
Claudia, aren't you coming?
You already know what they are.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
Are you feeling better?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
And what about you?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Why?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
There too...
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Ettore...
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
You really must do me this one favor.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
He loves you the way you are.
But she watches... she listens.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
What do you mean?
For what?
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Yes.
Uh huh.
Why should they?
Yes.
And what did you do?
And what happened?
No.
Why not?
Why not?
What the child?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
Yes.
Yes?
... makes me...
That you're a mistake?
Oh, yes.
What?
Yes I am.
Because I'm in trouble.
Of what?
Why?
And then what happened?
Why?
No...
She took the baby in her arms?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
What?
Why?
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Do you still go to church?
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
No-one.
Yes.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Yes, but I...
So, someone else could have done it.
That possibility never occurred to you?
Not simple, no.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
All right, what do you need.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Nothing.
What sheets?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know... 
And what has that to do with it?
Saint Peter?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Yes I do.
Begin what?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
That's what I have to believe...
And the baby.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
They are?
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Well --
Oh, it's all right.
Why aren't you at work?
They'll be here.
Leave them drums alone.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Ever seen one of these before?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Have I said something amiss?
Well ... come on.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
And cunning.
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
That little old man.
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
I hope he fell off.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Now, look here, Norm ...
Oh you are, I know you are.
And my nose...
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Where's my grandfather?
Well ...
Are you in pain?
... I don't know...
Where's Irth?
Where the hell are we?
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Close enough to walk to!
Wretched.  What happened to me?
What's wrong?
Yes!
How long to fix?
What?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
Right. 
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
Boy, that's terrific.
Hey now, what is this?
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Now we're in for it.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
What do you mean, no?
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
First contact...
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
Receiving.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
It's stopped?
The commander normally has first publication rights.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
They're getting pretty close now.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
Yeah, okay. 
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Would somebody fill me in?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
What's that supposed to mean?
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
What is it?
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
When?
How much air-time have I got?
Hey, Guttierez?
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
What the hell are you doing?
Still got him?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Wait.  Lost it.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
That's what we thought.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Hurry it up.
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
Jesus.
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
It needn't be.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
I don't think that's funny.
It wasn't meant to be.
... and Karen.
Feeling better, my dear?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Eve! My understudy...
In time she'll be what you are.
Right here. A minute ago.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Huh?
Knit me a muffler.
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
What?
She's a girl of so many interests.
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Nothing, really...
Don't mix your metaphors.
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Margo, let's make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I wish it were.
You know what I'm going to be?
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
It's only one picture deal.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Also Addison deWitt.
Ah...
What have I got to do with it?
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
What did you expect - live sables?
You need new girdles.
Buy some.
Oh, brother.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Hmm?
Like an agent with one client.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
What for?
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Oh, no. I see the play.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
Hollywood.
The show must go on.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
May I have your coat?
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
They certainly don't waste much time.
There can't be very much-
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
But the raves about your performance-
- an understudy's performance.
Congratulations, Eve.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
No, don't go...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Ain't it the truth?
You've what?
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Coming?
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
Where'd you get all that information?
Eve?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Such as?
What's so funny?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
How about calling it a night?
Where is she?
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
That's right, but I don't understand-
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
But what could she do?
Promise.
--no way--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
--we will--
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
I think that's him.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
You overslept?
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
The telephone calls... we know about that.
--Teddy Kennedy?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Speak.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
I have nothing more to say.
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
...check...?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
Sorry.
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
Of course, I didn't --
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
What?  No I'm not.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
I'm not playing.
Yeah right.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jessica, can you drive me home?
You mean...and orgasm?
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Hey, where's Finch?
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
I know, Dad.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Michelle.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
I told you.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
You can do that?
I still think you're okay.
No...you...go...ahead.
Uh...
Ho-lee shit.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Kevin, this is serious!
Let me know.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Like how?
But you don't love me.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Hey...
You sure you're comfortable?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
I'm such a loser.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
The key is don't look down.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Andy! Holy shit!
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
What about your glasses?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
No wonder he let her go.
Oh God. Shit...
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Nothing's happening!
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
I have my reasons.
Every Russian family has one..
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Oh! I'm sorry...
I'm so scared...
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Trust me, it's her!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
You'd lose your security deposit?
You're a princess...
See? The Princess is under there ...
What do you mean?
So where will you go?
Rasputin!
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Can I have your autograph?
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Yes.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Well, then, w-who was?
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
For yuh.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
You sure?
No, I got time.
Sylvia Plath.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
What?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
As Balzac said...
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
No.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Look at these guys.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
How is it any different?
It relaxes me.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Oh, you have my body.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
M'm.
G-go on, I'm interested.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
I'm following you and David, if you-
Is he in the bathroom?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
I'm late.
Step up here!
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Charlie Chaplin.
Just give me the license, please.
I have some very good memories there.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
SO?
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Yeah.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Yeah.
A long time.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Would it make a difference?
It has your ring.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
The movie.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
I don't know how to make her funny.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Really.
So where is young Jonah?
Take good care of it.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
Leave us alone right now.
Cal, my wife Judy.
There's a test, you know.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Just do what I say, alright?
Through the sweats or not?
What?
No.  I missed that.
Okay, knock it off.
Don't be so sure.
Well he can't have gone far.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Anyone else?
You're not ready.
Yes.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
Okay.
That's under lock and key.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Yes I did.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
The infamous dog?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Ours.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Uh-huh.
Elitism?
What am I, five?
Medallions.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Yes.
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
Is there space here?
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
She's all over him, are you blind?
You see, that's worse.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Like the last time.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Um.  Happy for you.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
I hope they're watercolors!
Hm.
Oh Soph...
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Not nice.  Not kind.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Really?
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
I'm Princess Bala.
You dance...
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Water...water...
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Z!  what are you doing?
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
And do Princesses do improper things?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
You new, kid?
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
ARREST HIM!
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
Ask me why we're so successful.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
Care to make a small wager?
Would you like to?
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
One more?
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
You all right? What's the matter?
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
What's her first name?
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
I don't want it.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
A cemetery?
Sure.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
I don't want to talk to him.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
A what?
You did?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Where?
Here.
The dishes?
We're going to finish that gin game.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
What for?
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
What kind of joint are you running?
Are you going to deny it?
You better.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Relax, Baxter.
Yes, of course.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Sir?
You're going to take her off my hands?
I got kicked in the head, too.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
What are you going to do, Doc?
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Aren't you?
I'm not sure.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Good night?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
That guy really must've belted him.
Dreyfuss.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
I want you back, Fran.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
All set for what?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Baxter?
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Who the hell are you?
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
So what happened ?
Who's he?
Not a thing.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
What'd he say?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Well, get in there.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Who knows? Right.
They nail him for it bad ?
Ours.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
How did they know?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
No, sir.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
How big it is?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Do you?
How's the pain?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I had immense plans.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
You knew him best.
He'll kill us.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
I'm sorry to hear that.
What will you do after the war?
What's a big question?
So that's it.
What show ?
That's 27, sir.
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
165  CONTINUED:  
212  CONTINUED:
Had?
You should know something.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Was there any trouble?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
You're hurt.
A daughter in Oregon.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
I already have.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Shut up!
Answer and I'll shoot!
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I need to rent a cabin.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Do you love me?
His name?
Spencer.
How old are you?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Two days.
You take off when you have to.
Hello?
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Thanks, Melvin.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Never.
You don't owe me that.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Hello.
Grouchy?
What job?
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
You know what? I...
Why? What have you been thinking about?
How to die, mostly.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
How's Verdell doing?
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
About a dog.
Actually, I don't think so.
Absolutely.
Oh, is he dead?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Would you leave now, please?
You going to come talk to me or not?
But you know where you're lucky?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?
No fucking way.
So what happens now?
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
Oh, yeah.
I'm on the scent.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Who is the mark?
Hello, Robert.
The contract?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Bullshit.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
An assassin?
Because he is trying to retire me.
Forget it!
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Why?
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
More or less.
Ahhhh...
I don't know.
That's where he'll be.
Yes.
No.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
You should knock.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
We split the money?
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Yes.
I went into their room this afternoon.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
No.
Why?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
It happened to you before?
Yes.
I'm not normal.
I'm taking off my mike.
Electra --
I wasn't watching television.
Thank you.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
You wish to close this account today?
How would you like the funds?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Well, don't get carried away.
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Nope.
Close!
Do you think anyone will really come here?
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, not yet.
No, We aren't going to do it.
You capitalist pig!
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Did you see anything in the files?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
What about me?
I can't go with him.
Do you know the way?
Yeah, pretty well.
Doug?
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
What? You are crazy!
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
There's nothing there for me.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
About forty minutes.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
You will wish you hadn't.
A kind of freedom.
No!
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
No, just a drill.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
It's more than what you're worth.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Why not?
I don't want his money.
To see your father?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
He wants to talk to you.
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
The address?!
-- This your idea of small talk?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
-- This play means a lot to me.
I know you don't want help.
I'm an enemy?
Like you'd know.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
All of it.
It's not.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
She great or what?
Yes. But not as a date date.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
Your turn.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
You make me feel...
Assholes. This happen to you?
How do you know this place?
You planned this --
Ergo?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Pull over.
Now? We just --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
So talk to us about something.
Your parents are divorced?
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Please.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
Yeah.
What do you want, Biff?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
How old are you?
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
How are you?
Well... yeah...
Why what?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
March 11th.
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
How did you know?
I know.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
Perfect...
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
Hi, Marty!
Oh yeah?
That's what he told you, huh?
I'll catch up with you.
You lost that one?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
I mean it.
What'd you come out here for?
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
No, you're not either.
What?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
What a nice place.
Somebody else is going to get it.
But it would hurt.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
You tired?
Don't.
Everybody loves trout.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Hi.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Just thinking.
Yes.
Fine.
You're my friend, aren't you?
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Where're you goin'?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Oh, my.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
How d'ya like your room!
...Hello.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
A souse!
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
...Barton, is everything okay?
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Howdy, neighbor.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Nope.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
That's all right, really –
Hi, Charlie.
How did you know about that?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Are you sure –
No... Can I come in?
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Jesus... You're leaving.
I apologize, Barton.
Congratulations.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
...Okay
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Charlie... Charlie's back...
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Yeah, I was drinking.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
Yes.
What was she like?
No, Nick, please --
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What was she like in school?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Yes, you do.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
There's a name from the past.
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Yes.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
How's your new book?
Fine.  How's your back?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
How'd you get in here?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Somebody has to die.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
You have the right to an attorney.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I don't know.
I don't think it's funny.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
You feeling better?
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
It was an accident.
She's a suspect.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
No. Should I have?
I'm a painter, too.
What do you think?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
The whole thing – painting.
What about the shit they write?
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
That's good. At least they're interested.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
How much for these five?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Jean, your parents are here.
What do you mean?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
You're not?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
You got a date already?
You're shattering all my myths.
Your people.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
What's the rush, John Henry?
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
You mean babies with you?
What's that?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
How can I ever thank you?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So keep painting.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Pouring myself into my work.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Nope, I told her everything.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
This is easy.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Mr. Freeze.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I was just hanging around.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
There's one other thing. I feel..
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Why's that?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Now black rubber.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Nostrovia.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
What do you know about obsession?
That kid is amazing.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Well, I met someone...
Fast work. You just moved here.
I'm not-
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Edward...
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
I got family. ...Please.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Go ahead. You can say it.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
What are you talking about?
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
How much do you weigh?
Please.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
All street mimes should be executed.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Ahm.....
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
oh dear.
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Bye, Dad.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
But is she gonna be okay?
off the peg?
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Come on Sting!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
And Boot-Head.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Damn, huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Butt-snatch...
Beavis.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
...Two...
Ah, the witness?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Cool. Huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Cabin fever, hon?
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Won't?  Or can't?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
That little girl saw us.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Aren't you scared?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
Help vouchers?
Are you available?
We're...
No.
Our cemetery?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Where'd they go?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
No, dummy.  Two.
Beetle!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.

I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
What's wrong?
Is there much more of this torture?
Is this the key to the attic?
They don't want to come down.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
You can pull your trousers up, now.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
He does, does he?
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
Yes. I am.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
No. It won't do that.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Chauncey!
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
I see.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
I can't read.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Well, ain't that the truth...
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
I have no claim, Thomas.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Yes. It has.
Try again.
No headaches?
And look who you brought with!
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
... Yeah...
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This is not what I requested.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
... Well?
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
You take care too, Bobby.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
And he was with her.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
My God!
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
A better friend.
I'm sorry for everything.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Money, Miss Warts?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
The usual, Barry.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Can I be anyone I want?
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Do you?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I love you, Lotte.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Yeah?
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Folks come. Folks go.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
You don't sit with me!!
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Yes ma'am.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
No, let her rest.
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
You was friends.
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
Yeah. Look bad?
What? What? You talking back to me?
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
They range up to three thousand.
Yeah.
They posted the next round of the tournament--
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Burkhalter.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
They were Nazis, Dude?
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Uh-huh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
No, they--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Yes, heh--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
And what do you do, sir?
Howdy do, Dude.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
So Dieter has the money?
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
But he's--
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
Donny!  Please!
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Huh?
The what?
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
The nail polish, Walter.
What about the toe?
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Dude--
The bulk of the series.
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Oh, shit.
Walter, you fuck!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Then what's...
Call the medics, Dude.
Well can we--
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Did I urinate on your rug?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Is this a--what day is this?
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Each day is a little life.
You're hurting me.
How does it look?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Put it back in park, Blade.
Thought you were dead.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
From his father, of course.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Get in. You’re leaving.
You're not going anywhere.
Is something wrong, my friend?
You're blind --
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
Why?
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
You used me as bait?!
But, he could've --
What are you looking at?
Graffiti --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
It's dark in here.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
-- tearing me -- apart.
I know. Take some of my blood.
I was afraid that might happen.
Deacon brought me back.
You don't have to be.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
LaMagra --
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
What happened to the power?
Not that I can see.
Domini?
Yes.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
--I'm not staying here!
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Druid Hill Park.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
You don't want it though.
Why is there no "our" here?
You said the name "James."
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
--you should get back into bed.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
Oh, Jesus, no--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
You have to go.
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
Never would've guessed.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
--Cotter: shut up.
English.
Fucking owl!
Yeah. Me too.
Nobody's going anywhere--
<u>What</u>?
Running a junk yard.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
She got <u>paid</u>.
You planning on sleeping out there?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
Cotter'll kill you.
--bullshit--
Okay. Hypothetically.
Spare me.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
I should check on Anna.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
--it's urgent!
....Ma'am?
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
No, I--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
It'll pass.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
No.
Sign.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
What do you think?
Ya catch any fish?
How would I know?
Pour that back.
This.
Thanks Meurice.
Got a problem, Meurice?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
What is this? What color is it?
Okay?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Is Sandy part of this?
Who knows you have these?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
You want to see him too, right?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Frank gone?
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Do you like talk like that?
Nothing. Are you alright?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
Yes, I like you.
Look.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
I want you to stay with me.
I'll call you.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Shh. I'll tell you.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Heineken.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Maybe so.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
You saw a lot in one night.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Okay. be careful.
You better not, Jeffrey.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Okay.
Where to?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Dorothy Vallens?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
No. you're right.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Greetings, Mr. George.
Where do you guys want to count?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
What is?
Surprise.
Tuna, this is crap.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What?  Yeah, sure.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Goodness.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Murder.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
We're half a million off.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Barbara.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Not mad.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
Dad.
No.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
How are you doing, George?
Do I know you?
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
Yeah.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Well, here I am.  See?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
Where are you going?
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Yeah?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
Yeah.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Like cats and dogs.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
What was the nature of the argument?
Sex.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
No.
Her name?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
And how are you now?
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
-- And what did you suggest?
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
You'll be sorry?
Oriental medicine.
Yes.
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
Where did you meet him?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
What happened next?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
That bastard!
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Three fifteen.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Something like that.
I thought the subject was sex?
This is your house.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Yes -- it would be nice.
Alone?
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
Why?
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
This is not relaxing.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Why did you lie to me?
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
I know.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
It had to get there somehow.
SO!
Well, there's a problem.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Not yet. You want to go?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Was this during Betty?
Did we want to?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
Oh, yes.
They got heat in Michigan.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
Oh. When did you move back?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Mind if I smoke?
No, your kids.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Why, do you think?
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Am I interrupting anything?
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Have you ever been to that station?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
I bet you could do a book.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Am I too heavy for you?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
About an hour ago.
It clearly states in the will --
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
You people really don't like dogs.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Shit.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
Sorry, my brother.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
We'll have to sneak in.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Are they on the radio?
Why?
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
You got the cash?
What are we doing down here?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
Did you do it?
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
Not that I remember.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You shouldn't have hit me.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Know what?
We're family, Caesar.
Gimme the gun.
She's doing the work herself.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
They were early.
But you know he did it.
Violet, please!
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
Don't tell him --
I should have let him kill you.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
How many'd you do?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
No.
We was worried about you, Cease.
See?  We're for real.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Five years is a long time.
I'm already in your bed.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I'm glad you did.
What's wrong?
I don't understand - ?
I don't.
What the fuck was it?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
You mean Shelly?
Even though he knew about you?
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
You said he washed the money?
Yeah.
It's in a case, on his desk.
Yeah.
What time did you say they would be there?
He'll have to run.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
Forget it.
What do they want me to do?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Yes.
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
I need a ride.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Where are we?
Where?
-- how? --
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
And that's it?
Can I help you?
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Where's the dog?
What?
What the hell're you talking about?
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
That's the only angle.
What's that?
Tell him we're busy.
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
Where am I?
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
What? How do you know my name?
I'm waiting for my daddy.
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
What's the matter?
Remember how they used to stick out?
SAM! What a surprise!
What?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
You got the wrong man.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
What has Tuttle done?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Why?
So what are you going to do about her?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Take her off the list.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Bastard!!!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
I bet you'd like to touch them?
It's my fucking life.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
What?
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Yes.
They're gone.
Where are you going?
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Really.
A cheque.
The refund for Tuttle!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Yes.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
You haven't switched it on.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
What have you done with his body?
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
The pace?
What if there is no tomorrow?
Es impossible.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
No underwear?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Mary said you might be coming.
Where is she?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
No way, man.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
What look?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Last show of the night.
I'm sorry.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
Who with?
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Turn it off.
They'll just keep calling.
Well why didn't you say so?
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
What?
It's not loaded.
No.  No.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
That's your full name?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Then it went well.
Do others feel that you did well?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Don't say anything about anything.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Outside?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
The cost-efficient reporter.
Just a few questions?
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
It's Aaron.
Should I...
Because...
I wish it were you giving the story.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Is everything all right?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
If we could just eat first.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Billion.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
What do you mean clean?
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
It's not important.
Who?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Well, when?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Yes.
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Then you should stay here.
A picnic?
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Tonight.
Oh it's enough...
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Are you ready?
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
What?
Walter...I can't believe it.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
I didn't mean to.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
A show..how soon can we go?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I also saw the girl give you this.
Telling you what?
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Hi.
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
Hello Mayolia.
You don't have to do anything!
Gee.  Thanks.
T-tell him that?
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I look horrible.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
You think?  Split?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Let me in.
Invite me in, Pike.
I... feel.... pretty.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Buffy, honey?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Hey there.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
You broke up with my machine?
You want some water or something?
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
A dress.
Dress, huh?  What for?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I'm glad you came.
Are you okay?
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Just stay away from me, okay?
China.
How do you know all this?
All right.  What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Sporting events, yeah.
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
They were vampires?
A what?
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
Five?
Five.
As for example, what?
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
That is so cool.
My parents have money...
I'm just a girl.
Buffy!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
I don't think so.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
You can't seduce me.
We lost.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Why you shaking me off?
Fastball.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Boring.
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You're a great catcher.
Forget it.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
No way.
Who you calling a "boy"?
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
We're eight and sixteen.
It's a damn convention.
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Was I at that dinner?
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Stop -
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
She's not here, Sam.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Nope, there's no way.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
No, no it's okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Yeah?
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
My wife?
Listen, I would -
Okay?
No, a...
What are you -
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
You've got to stop her.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
I...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
Why not make them happy?
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I-I'll do it.
Thank you.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
You sure?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
What are you talkin' a- ?
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
So, what'd ya do with it?
Yeah.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
I had a... salad.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
What if he won't stop?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
You want your jewelry?
I wouldn't do that...
Now you need approval from him to go home?
You are not threatening me anymore!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Well...
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
No.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Yeah, that works out.
Can I go in?
Can I go in?
Nicky, I did -
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Mm.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Nothin'.
Yeah.
No, he's not.
A sponsor.
Nicky, please...
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's what you want?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Get lost?
Okay?
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
You are.
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
You do?
It means I got the money.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Listen...
There's more!
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Yeah.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
They're havin' a good time too.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
No, no, no, no!
Hey.
My fuckin' head.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Hey! Oh!
There's a lot of people here.
Yes, uh...
Guilty. I am.
You're probably right.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Pass!
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Did you try to kill...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
You seem sad, Spooky.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
You could've made me lose my call.
I didn't hurt you.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's seen both of us now.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Lose the hardware now.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Stop throwing names at me.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
"Theo?"
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
A price on everything.
Does she wear glasses?
What's happening?
What do you mean?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Why tell me this?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Yes?  Yes?
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Can you walk?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
You timed that beautifully.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Stop talking like that!
I'm still okay.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
Think you could do a picture of me?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
What's your point?
I don't want it.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Didn't we play this scene before?
Twenty percent.
They saw you kill the driver.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
Where do we meet?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
I don't know what you mean.
It's in the process.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Seems like it.
Who am I talking to?
Call me "Nels."
The fuck I will!
Yeah?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
How far off are you?
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Hold on.
You could always make it up to her.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
She's not a girl, Col --
Hi.
Saw it, Dil.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
What's that supposed to mean?
Who's she?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
They're jealous.
Someone out there.
No.
No --
Yes...
Do I?
But you can t stay, you know that?
You mean that?
Why?
Drink.
Must be.
Sure I do.
Will you meet me again?
Do they know?
Absolutely.
A little.
Don't.
Come on.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Yes.
And you're not going to tell me more?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
Your soldier.
You tried.
Whatever you say, Dil.
It's my name, Dil --
Promise?
Fergus.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Yes.
You sure?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Who is he?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
What's that?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Best game in the world.
Who's Dil?
Depends on what you believe in.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
When I was a child...
You won't run.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
I could eat a horse.
Oh!
What's the matter?
You don't look so bad in this light.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
What is it?
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
You lied to me so many times --
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Oh, I see.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
No.
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Brian.
Yes.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Why you lied to me.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Sure.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
You can't.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
I'm not fifteen.
What are you doing?
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Who?
Alex --
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Then I suggest you call one of them.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
What do you mean?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
I don't know.
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Voilà what?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
But he is gone.
How's that?
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
What was what?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
What'd he say?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Don't put yourself out.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
No -- no, I'm don't.
But why do you want a divorce?
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
That's impossible.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Are you sure?
This will relax her.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
You're not?
Pay no attention to me.
I am.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Yes.
Oh nice save.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
FINE. Are you?
What?
I won't.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
I'm fine.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
Are you coming to the party?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Hi princess.
Lisa Sherman?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
On what side of the family?
You're so beautiful.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
It's a damn postal truck!
A little early for a delivery.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since today.  New policy.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...and fair...
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
I need your help.
I got, like, uh....
All right, then how about this?
I need your truck!
Go on.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog was mean before I met him.
...up.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Yeah, borrowed!
Ah, one of them's in the back.

...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
Back up!  Back...

  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
I think...
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
 Okay.
Goddamn!
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Left, left, left!
...Night Shift, but you might...

Come on.
Whoo!
Ho, ho...
All right.
 Okay.  Okay. 
...yeah.

Okay.  Okay.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
...shit.
...miles.

...man.
They're movin'.
Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!

We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Yeah.
 Okay.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Come here.
Hang...
...tunnel!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What the--?
What?

Come on.  Come on.
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Hold this. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Look out.
You did help a little.
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
...us.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
No.
Yeah.
 big balls.

...about him.
I urge you to be persuasive.
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Vaughn.
...take my sorry old truck.
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
You got a prob-...
What?  Say again...
Thank you.
...owe you.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Whoo-hoo! 
...-tor Long.
You have my word on that.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
"I am become Death, the...
...I wish they would've let me say something...
...-ple.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Radio the bikes.
Hit him.
...quick in and out.
Shit.
What about these two?
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
That's right.
 But...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?





Uh, we both like to fish.
It's not over, Brynner.
...colonel?
...-five.

Excellent.
He's brains without ambition...
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...without caution...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
And what if it does?
...that the prey can bite back.
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...you answer mine.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
I didn't sell the boy any...
You redneck idiot, do you have...

What happened to Colonel Brynner?
Just go check the temperature.
Don't move!
You sure?

Arlo.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
...gotta seal it.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Always?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Oh yes.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
At my age, you tend to lose track...
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
How much are you worth?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
What's that, Curly?
What kind of guy do you think I am?
In the garage.
I don't know...
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
And why's that?
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
You and your husband never discussed her?
My husband's at the office.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
No. I went riding rather early.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
For very long?
Yes... why?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Never forgave him for what?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Know him?
And Hollis knew about it?
I'll stay.
I gave everybody the night off.
As little as possible.
Hold still. Why?
You saw my fa... father? When?
You bastard.
I can't...
You know any good criminal lawyers?
What are you saying?
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
I'll take care of it.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Who?
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Yes...
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
That's a long fall.
Sure you do.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Apple core?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Fifty lire... 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
You understand now? You see it clearly?
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Who else you been to see?
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Yes -
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
What's happened?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Oh!!
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
What's funny now?
Oh!
Where's the soap?
A rooster?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Would you sing for me?
I mean in New York.
At night?
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
I'm not sorry.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Impossible!  Impossible!
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Close the door, Raymond.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
I'd like to talk to you about that.
I'm drunk.
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
Yes.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Well, thanks a lot.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Who told you you could sit down here?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
He married you, didn't he?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
Jesus!
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Can I use the bathroom?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
He was?
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
Sang.
Who doesn't?
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Yeah.
This is the last time I come to this place.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Well, he missed!
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
So?
What time do you have to stay till?
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
She called me.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's cheating?
She called you Brad?
She called me Brad.
What do you mean?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Oh yeah.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
There's more?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
She's in here?
Let's hear it.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Thirty-seven!
FUCK!
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
You know what pisses me off the most?
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Why not?
She was pretty young, hunhh?
I swear.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
His dick was in his mouth?
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
What's that for?
If you must.
And this is what you rented?
You're kidding.
Hey, what about Veronica?
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
It's not like I'm miles away.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You know him?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
One seventy-nine.
Maybe.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
The white kind.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
At least they weren't lit.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Typically male point of view.
How many girls have you slept with?
I'm not the pig you are.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Where?
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
And that made you feel better?
What're you talking about?
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
You said you were here all day?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
I do about three-fifty, four.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
I'm not sad.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Dental School.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Surprise me.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Tucker?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Glad you could drop in.
I'm coming out!
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
I'm going with you.
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
The winds are picking up.
I don't understand?
Excuse me?
Which could maybe what?
From one professional to another, of course.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
What if he can't?
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
You got to go back now!
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Call me sentimental.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Gabe are you alright?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Just kidding.
I burned it.
Never could save a thing.
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Ask the questions.
I don't trust him.
What about it?
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Good evening.
So this is the young man?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
I beg your pardon?
Who said that?
What crime did you commit.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Yes sir.
No, sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Are you an Epileptic?
Crabs?
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Vitamins will it be then?
But it was horrible.
I haven't seen you before.
Oh.
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Indeed.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Mothballs, sir.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Sir, 655321, sir.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
What?
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
You should start a union.
We have a deal.  What's your name?
You're cool.
With what?
Max.
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What are you doing?
How?
So what?
You mind?  I'm working here.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
She's in the hospital.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Doesn't cover everything.
Gimme your wallet.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
And you believe me...?
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow down.
Well.  That was brilliant.
Max?
Look, I'm sorry --
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
What's the charge?
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
You're certifiable.
I've been reading up on it.
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
Pretty scary, huh?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Not this again.
What van?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
You will?
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Connecticut.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Back where?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
A dog bit it.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
What?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
So?
I disagree.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Are you threatening me?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Ellie.
I don't understand.
What would you have me say, David?
What's the status of the decryption effort?
This is how you see the sky?
Could we hear to China?
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
I'd say this is slightly different.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
We could be together again --
But what about your research -- ?
It's really happening.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
How do you mean?
So.  The final countdown.
The final countdown.
You're trembling.
I'm sorry.
Please --
I can't hear this now --
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I'm not sure it's come to that.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Oh lookit that brunette.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
On my own.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
What's the writing say?
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
You bastard!
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You come and visit.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
If he's not out, why are they here?
For months... last October.
Nothing.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
How do you know that?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
Halloran.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
He was in my apartment!
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
What's wrong with him?
What about her arms?
Right.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
Where you going?
Or the F.B.I.?
Detective Niccoletti?
Put in the Kevin Costner.
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
So - why the airport?
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
What does he want from you?
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
What?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
How can I help?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
What do you think?
Ecru.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
I gather he's late as usual.
I'll see you soon.
Honestly, Letty.
Yeah?
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
For a price.
No.
Don't be ridiculous.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
I have a terrible confession.
Your family just met me.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Where to?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Do you like it?
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Something like that.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
I guess we need to talk.
Well then why'd it happen?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
You don't have a fever.
But what about that math project?
I don't think so.
Especially this last year.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
No, you've done a perfect job.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
No, no.
So will you?
No...
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
Oh.
I'm glad you're doing well.
All tapped out.
Agent Hadley.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
A pass.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Oui.
You don't trust me?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
And?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I guess we're going to find out.
And for my help I would get what?
Why is everything an argument with you?
Hopefully no one.
I'm going to kill him myself!
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Hadley --
It's not your fault, Daniel.
What?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
What do you want now?
I've got a way with people.
I just thought that--
Hey boss, it's not a science.
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't serve wine here.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
Me?
How's my brother?
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
The hell it is.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
How are we going to do that?
You're not helping.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
You ask a lot of questions.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
No.
What are you doing?
Who are you waiting for?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
What's this?
You're back!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Do you know her?
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
You know about Lo?
Come and get it if you can.
Lo?
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Let them look.
Good.  And how are you?
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
You were enlightened?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
Then, why did you come?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
But Wudan does not accept women.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
What does it say?
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
You buying?
No onions?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
Mom --?
Mister Funboy.
Does she have a name?
You gotta go now, I bet.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
T-Bird?
I wish to possess what you have now.
Neither.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Get it?
Go away.
...necklace... pearls...
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Why not?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
At this hour? I don't think so.
Please.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
How was your date?
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay?
Somerset Maugham.
Need any company?
Oh please.
I do.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Where did you say she's from?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
See that wasn't so bad.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
What do I do then?
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I was just kidding.
Want to join me?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Oh baby... oh baby...
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Who is this?
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
I see your point... though why should I care?
Sounds intriguing.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
Be more specific.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Yippy.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
Ronald?
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
What about her?
Ronald? That's crazy.
I need to talk to Annette.
Do you know where she is?
Nope.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
You get your wish!
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
Sometimes.
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
What's her name?
Irena.
Where is everybody?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
Something's haywire,
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
I'm never unfair.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
I thought you were with Amy.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Yes, daddy.
Why didn't you run after them?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Who are you?
I'm your friend.
Will you be friend for always?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
A princess?
That one's an elm.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Don't cry, Amy.
You mustn't be afraid.
But why?
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
No, thank you.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
Good night, mother, good night.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
And Amy mailed them?
Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
Maybe he's just shy.
Do you really need these?
Can't you get contacts?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
No, did you fuck him?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
And he was missing an arm.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
I could smell another woman on him.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
What choice do we have?
I really gotta pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
This really isn't a good time.
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
You busted me.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
My mom used to get PMS too.
Everything okay?
Except Mark of course.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
Is that how you feel?
Your breasts feel larger.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Peter I love you too but...
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Worse than this?
You can't believe this bullshit.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
You're some catch Lloyd.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
What?
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
What is this place?
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Sorry, sir.
Good.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Why give yourself up?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Where do you think this goes?
But I...
I see.  The verdict, yes...
I didn't realise...
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Water?
Yes.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
Can I get my life back?
You've been working too hard.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Holy cow.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
For a month.
I'm not certain about...
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Is that everybody?
What about the wife?
When does it break?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Alan...
Does it make the cars any better?
Something like what...
I can't say.
Yeah.
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
Didn't mean to bum you out.
They asked me to help.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
I know. I'm sorry...
Yeah.   He's a good man.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
Then why did you come here?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
We got a boat.
This stuff really works? No shit?
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
NOOOOOOOOO!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Step up here, Tyler.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Don't stop.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
This is stupid.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
That's your sister school, right?
No.
Are you going with Chet?
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Yes sir.
A yawp?
Yawp!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
You know me, always taking on too much.
So what do you think of my father?
I'll take him over mine.
What is it then?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
From you?
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
I will be with thee straight.
This play?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Who are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
Which question is that?
And no questions asked.
Who asked any?
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Where are my men?
Who gives a shit about aft?
That's where my boat's moored.
What other bunch?
Seen a lot of islands?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
How do you know that?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
...Jagger was here...I was here...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Joey...
Check it out!
John,we're going huntin'.
I thought that was it.
What the --!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
You talk to him?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Everybody love Linda.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Biederman, yes.
Linda...
Linda, Linda...!
Okay.
How are you?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
Yeah.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Pow?
Hey, Nick?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
We gotta play with more bullets.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Here, here! This is it!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
No!!!?
What do you mean, no???
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Did you go hunting.
Did you get one?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
No.
That's who.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Up I would say... What would you say?
Up.
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Kimberly!
My man Dubbs.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Remember my promise.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
You sure?  I can help you.
I drive.
Does it drive itself, too?
I'll inform dispatch.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
She's pretty.
Hey, I'm eating.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
How do I look?
What's this?
You treat her nice.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
Yes.
Hi.
Hi.
Jabez -- ?
No, thank you -- what's your name?
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
She couldn't be gone!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
I do -- and I think you should too.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Not long -- now.
Well, I --
Coming along, Jabez?
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Well -- yes --
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
I'll get the doctor.
Worried!
There is nothing to worry about now.
I'll get it, Jabez.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
I'll never get my washing done.
I'm serious.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Mary! Come back ...
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
I want you to fix these fish!
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
How 'bout some Christmas music?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
No, sir.
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
New York...
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Roy?  You still with us?
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
I still feel like shit.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Bullshit.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
What about the kids?
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
I'm really shakey.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah...
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
What do you want?
The girl hostages.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
You're full of shit ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Okay, is the vault open?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
We like you, too.
Thanks again, Sam.
It's up to you ladies.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Yeah.
Pure?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Not now, Mom, please.
Why are you doing this?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
That's the rumor on the street.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.

Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
There are no bond certificates.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
My brother.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
What did he do this time?
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
And?
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.

OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Eddie Lovell.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
What are you so worked up about?
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
You are too crude.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Keep it.

I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
What else?
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Tina, you're sweating.
To get my money.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Magic Johnson.
It's e-vit-able.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.

Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Hey guys.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
What are you wearing?
Okay.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
I go to school where I live.
I think it's just over there.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
Oh, is this your special place?
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
H A R R Y...
One day they'll find a cure.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Just a guy I hang out with.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Peg leg?
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
I will stop this car right now.
You're not my real dad.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
These are really cold, huh?
I don't know. Owwww.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
No one knows?
A blimp.
George Washington!
Hey, look. Ice cream.
I lugged it all over town!
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
A float!
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
That's gross.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Why ith dat newth?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Do I know you?
That's the downside. There is none.
Sure.
Do we have a deal?
Have you got what I want?
How was that?
Obviously.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Times two.
It's a surprise.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
So, this is Leto the Just...
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Yes...
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
I am always on time.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Dracula?
I didn't feel well...
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
"It is my home."
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
I've never seen anything like him!
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
I'm no good.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
That's right...
Dolores, wait!
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
You could say that --
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Tits.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Lines around the block.
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
You're sure this is gonna work?
What octopus motor?
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Do they show it?
No! Do they show you having sex?
No.
What?!
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
No, uh...
Yes, Ed.
Uh-huh?
Ed --
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Who?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
I mean, that worked out.
Yes.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Hi, Mom. 
What are you talking about?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I mean bad.
Really?
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
The what?
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
You're in show business?
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
No. What happened?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Please!
You know what your problem is?
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
No. Two times.
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
By the X.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Dick... Dick,..
Mostly Tammy fans
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Looks good to me.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Where to?
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
I did it.
And when did you do it?
And how did you get in the school?
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
More this way.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Yep.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
And 290 "disregards," right?
What?
So?
She's doing this to get back at me
Who put you up to this?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Till 19-fucking-70.
Merry Christmas.
Are you sorry she's dead?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
You fuck for money.
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
I don't know.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Captain, what do you want?
<u>What do you want</u>?
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Yeah, that's Stens.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Dudley's guys.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Where are the police academy files?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Say what?
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Why?
Something like that.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
She is Lana Turner.
What?
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
No.
Really?  What did White say?
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
How about White?
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
When?
None.  Call it a hunch.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
You're back, boychick.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Shut up!
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
And no one'll know about this?
It'll be our secret.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
What'd he say to you?
Nothing.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Someone else?
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Yeah.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
I don't know what that--
What if--
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Gimme that.
We lost 'em.
That wasn't so hard.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
No.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Law enforcement?
Oh my God.
Is it okay?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
That's my point.
Because my life is being ruined.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Well, you know--
I've seen it.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
It wasn't me.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
Is it over?
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
Who?
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
How's the trout?
It tastes like fish.
When do I get to meet him?
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
You're not.
Who's doing this?
You being audited?
This conversation's over.
He didn't.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Hey!
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Listen--
You're firing me.
Dad!
Do I know you?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Yeah.
Alright!
No.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Bobby--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
It's been a few years.
The police?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Why not?
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
What happened?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
Hiding something?
We believe?
You're kidding me.
If they've looked at the video.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
He said - be careful.
Pardon?
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Will you not come in?
No.
When were you most happy?
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
That day, had you followed me to the market?
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
Don't leave me!
A broken car?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
What?
Sorry, what's your point?
Could I trouble you for some water?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
May God make safety your companion.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Yeah, for a while.
So you can shoot a pistol?
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Top Hat.
Me?
Right.
What?
Really?  That's sudden.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
You'd better be.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
I try not to expect you.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Kip… I -
I'll always go back to that church.
Why Picton?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
Does he have to go?
Go away.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
What are you talking about?
What about your rank or serial number?
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Mr. MacDougal.
Are you...okay?
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
I've got something...
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
We going somewhere?
Very nice.
Fine. What do I do?
I know it well.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
I'll need that.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Thank you.
Won't take any time.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
To us. To the Mask.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
One, two, three...
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Yes. Yes.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
A parting gift from the Empire.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Can't be too careful.
Four billion dollars.
The sign of our partnership.
Come on.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
You gave them the eight billion.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
Oh, it is.
It's too soon.
You two make quite a couple.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Tony Marvin.
Fax these to this number, okay?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
Yes?
They did?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
The judge came up with a number.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Bullshit.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
You think there's more?
You wanna talk about --
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Whoa.  No shit.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Why good?
And if you had to guess ...
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
When?  Where?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
You're not gonna be there.
You see your office?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Cause I don't even know you.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
You're not nothing, Erin.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
Thinking.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
Think you could learn?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
I'm embarrassed.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Have you been logging on?
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
It'll be fine, yeah.
You're moving away?  When?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
You must survive, Luke.
Ben ... Ben ...
I can help them!
I feel The Force.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
I think we're in trouble.
You, too, golden rod.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Han, we need you here.
Yes.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
I'm against that.
Now you're making sense.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
Are you crazy!
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Who's staring?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
I was worried about you.
Get out of here, Lando!
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Free your mind and return he will.
I see a city in the clouds.
The Hoth System?
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
It won't get through the blockade.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Do you have a name?
But we saw Earth destroyed.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Shit.
Can you land?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Locked.
75% power.
Plissken...?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Delgado?
Is that what I think it is?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Don't follow me.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
What the hell is this?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
What?!
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
I left it in the tent, sir.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
Because you and the land are one.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
You are truly magnificent!
Now you must pay me.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Hi
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
We still don't know.
Oh, I see.
There is nothing.
Morning.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Convulsion?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Pretty close.
No.
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
What did you do today?
What kind of stuff?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
We'll see when we get home okay.
Hey, where'd this come from?
Yeah.
Captain who?
Who's Captain Howdy?
Regan, why are you reading that?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Sure.
Withering Heights.
You might loosen the straps then.
Do it again.
Bon Jour.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
No I probably wouldn't.
Is that a threat?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
...look down in pity...
Do you have an appointment?
Are you comfortable Regan?
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Honey ...
Teeth.
No.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Go fuck yourself.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Out.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Only on odd days.
No thanks.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
It wasn't like that.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
It's not gonna hurt you.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
Make it collect.
Yeah.  Something.
You recognized me.
Very realistic.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Because I can hear it.
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
What the hell are these?
What?
Celebrating.  Join me?
Expensive hangover.
Couple years.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
The tenth's out.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
The audience was a little off tonight.
You sure?
Sick?  How sick?
The flu.
Blanche.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
We're finished.
What's he talking about?
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Hey!
Smells like fish.
What's with you two?
What's with you guys?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Is that important?
Brought it.
The name's Baker --
Pretty much.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
So why's he do it?
It's okay.  Last one.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
How do you know?
So, what happened?
Yeah... No.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
So how's the cat food business?
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Another five years, huh?
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
The recent past.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Why not?
John.  It's good to see you.
My place.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Hey, bro ...
For being one helluva guy.
... I was dreaming ...
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
What -- what are you doing?
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You mean like ... condoms?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What do you know about it?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
What about me?
But I think I like you better this way...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Where’s my real dad?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
Like what?
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Is it...?
I don’t think so.
Damn...
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
What’s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
But what do I do?
I don’t think so, thank you...
How’d you do this year, Tony?
About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Why not?
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
Uh...that baby’s crying...
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Well...Annie for one.
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
You had a heart attack?
And now...?
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Are you okay, Jack?
What’s going on?
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
You’re not married, are you?
Jack.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Hey, my wife’s in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Of course I did.
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
I can't take this.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
He's made a few changes.
How long was I out?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
And they're changing into...
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
You're really cramping my style here.
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Ben's still out there --
Come on, Ben, come on...
<u>Ben</u> did this?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Yes, thanks.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
What are you doing?
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Okay to proceed.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Benes... What the devil happened?
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
Shouldn't you answer that?
You must carry spare parts --
Thank you for saving my life.
That's what they pay me for.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
Don't tell me they're refueling...
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
There it is!
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Looks like quite a way to go...
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Yes, there is.
What's wrong, Skipper?
That's it...
Was there any damage?
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Certainly -
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Well, okay, it's -
You want your own wife kidnapped?
That's right. And we need more money.
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Both of these.
Oh, don't be silly.
Yah.
White Bear Lake?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Mm.
Yah.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Uhn.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Yah.
...Yah, okay...
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
...Mr. Lundegaard?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, I see.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Yah, real good.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Where're you going?
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
You told me about it.
The heck d'ya mean?
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
No, no, that's fine.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
So?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
So... they didn't...
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
- looking.
Yah.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Your mallard?
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Uh-huh.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Can't you give me something?
What?
And I saw you practicing this...
How did you find me?
That's the idea -- we split them.
What are you doing here?
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Where?  Here?
There?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
Guy or girl?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
I'm sorry, I...
What?
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Don't I?
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
What?
How do you feel?
Any historical figure.
Unbelievable, huh?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Promise you won't.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
... Marla ... ?
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
What... ?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
You took me to the house.
You have jobs.
You... you can't be serious about this.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...to let this happen!
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What the fuck -- ?
Paraffin.
Why... why... why... ?
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
... no, no, no...
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Appreciate something.
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Ain't that something?
What are you doing?!
Pleeeeeease!
How'd you know?
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Maybe.  What's this about?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Yeah, so what happened?
Tell me again how it started.
This is cheery.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Yeah?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Carter, get out!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
Again.
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Show me how it operates.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Read you.
It's a guy in a cage.
That guy's not going to make it.
Are they going to torture us?
Intelligence work.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Are you okay?
Thanks.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
You think you are... .
Why me?
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Well, there's nobody special!
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
I was attacked.
No, I'm fine... really...
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
I... You're not going to understand this.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
What are you two up to?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
How have you been?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Hello Lydia?
Huh-huh.
Your name was picked.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Have I died?
<u>What</u>?!
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
But I gave it to you!
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
What?
Happily married, probably.
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
Beautiful night huh?
You a fag too?
No just Parry.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
You're not going to play it again.
You can sing the song.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Just finish eating.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
No.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Alaska.
How do you know it's clean?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
You want me to hold the chicken.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
You always do this to me.
Sorry.
Robert...
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Where is she, anyway?
You're leaving?
What have you been doing since then?
Yes, intentionally.
That's dangerous, you know.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Nothing.
No, it isn't what I think.
That's right.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
I have to talk to you.
What?
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
I don't think that's true.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Who are you?
Do you have a name?
Wussup?
Remember me, from the pool?
Whadja wanna see me about?
So what's her name?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
I buy them flowers.
Why?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Pitt.
She lives near Eddie?
How old is he?
You live around here?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
What?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
Maybe tonight?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
They didn't do anything.
You're lucky.
Fletch.
Fletch F. Fletch
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's Babar.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
No idea.
Jesus.
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Where am I?
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
You may be right.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
Harry S. Truman?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
It’s okay. The cops did it.
They busted me last week.
We can't talk about it here.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
They serve dinner on the flight?
Did you hear something?
Not me.
Yeah.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
John Ultrarelamensky.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
It's amazing.
Can I ask you a question?
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
What are you talking about?
What's wrong, Gail?
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Who are you?
So you're saying she moved out.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
How could you call him?
Not really?
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Now that we've broken the ice...
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Did she tell you anything?
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
You going to be okay?
How'd you get this from her?
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
What an interface!
Hello?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
My axe!
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Are you okay?
You need it.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Who's my real father, man?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
How nice.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
Boca?
Got a wife named Angie.
I don't...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Comment va-t-elle?
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
What's your story?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
There's nobody like that on six.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Where the hell is it?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
What happened to you?
You got the warrant?
Timezit?
You know what I'm saying.
You're shitting me!
Baltimore?
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
Butch called.
He did.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I'm serious.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Frank, please...
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Where are you transmitting from?
Huh?
You sound...ground up...?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
What's that?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
She's not here.
October 22, 1969.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Whatta we do now?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
In my pocket.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I try to be.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Will you come with me?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
What d'ya got in there?
My whole world.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
No.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
So where's Cort gone off to?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Why didn't you cremate him?!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
You're talking about my lady.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Okay.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
He bought you that?
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Tell me.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And you'll never do it again.
Dear Christ...
Jason's here in New York.
They're out of town.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
What are you talking about?
What did you do with Rennie??
He is not.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Where are they?
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
We must abandon.
Guys ready to order?
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
But didn't we know it would happen?
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
And he was there?
Is it safe?
He'll hate it.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
What about her?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
The Red Sox
It's your best play, Nicky.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
She is kicking you out.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Why won't you tell me your name?
Mystery. Deception.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
See, Daddy.
Your father said you might be here.
All right. What's been going on?
Who the hell cares?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
People are dependable.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
They're only gonna lose.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
How come you got the kid with you?
Matthew's my grandson.
A grandmother. God bless you.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
I want to believe.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
I don't know.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
Postpone. We have every right.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Endearing.
He wears a disguise.
But you're his friend.
I don't know.
Someone waiting for you?
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
Oww!
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
God gave you ten thumbs.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
What can we do?
And Jinnah?
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
You mean a general strike?
The fools!  Sorry...
It's split the Government.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
You're an extraordinary man.
Assuming we are in agreement?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Who's leading them?
Have you read his magazine?
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
It's about the Director.
You okay, Jerome?
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
The Mission Director.
You wish.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
It's all right.
What are you talking about?
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Hello?
What do you think?
German, is that you?
Hugo!  I've found him!
No.
Why don't we say we were together?
In the South Wing.
What <i>is</i> this place?
What about the car?
Who are they?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
The doctor will give you something.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
Hi.
You okay?
You want to drive?
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
It doesn't look like that.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Assumed name... Houston.
Half a million.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
It's just been a while.
Really?
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Promise you won't laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
You sent me to him.
He must have.
When we had trouble before it was different.
You're full of ifs.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
You can't trust anything these days.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
I don't want to hear it.
You want to try with me?
I'll be ready.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Chicago.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Wire pull over?
Just fine.
Where we go in1?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
How?
Who?
Nothing. What could I do?
Well, he drove it into the river.
What?
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Nicer than most.
Though nicer than most?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
Sid Fletcher.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Nasty.
Is he coming here?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
Not entirely. No.
Sorry about your father.
Yeah.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Are you a traveller?
Definitely.
Will this do?
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Now just a minute...
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Still got a sense of humour?
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
What's that?
Polacks and deadbeats.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
I'm not?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
They did.
They killed the goose.
You get a bad month, all of a...
Eh?
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
What?
What?
Somebody...
Huh.
You're going to steal the leads?
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
I...
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
They're going to come to everyone.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I do?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
It's a waste of time.
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
To the cops?
No.
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
No, who?
You understand?
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Excuse me, sir...
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
Shelly...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
John.  John...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Why?
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
That's alright.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Yes, I am.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
What are you talking about?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
It was his idea.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Uh-huh?
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
John: John:...my daughter...
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
You sold eight Mountain View?
They took the phones...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Oh!  For the magazine...
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Gimlet.
Who did she call?
When did you write the check?
It's not me, it's my wife.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
What power?
She told me not to talk to you.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Fuck you.
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
What is this, your farewell speech?
Have a good trip.
Listen to me: They got some of them.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
It went down.  I filed it.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
...you want to go out today...?
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Yes.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
Your friend lives in a fine building.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Because I need MONEY!
Tom is right.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
I'm not afraid of his words.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
That's what I'm here for.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
What is it?  Can I help?
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I bet you can't guess what happened?
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Why?
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I took care of it.
I asked about Fredo?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
No questions.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
This committee owes an apology!
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Kay.
Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Michael.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Not good.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
I deny his every charge.
I know.
Says who?
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
The same assurance we got from you.
Fuck you.
What's to be jealous of?
It still hurt.  A lot.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Something I can do for you?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
I'm not married.
Why?
It's not what you think.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I'm not, you know.
Sorry.  Not today.
But we have to match the other sketch.
What happened?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're talking through your hat now.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
What did I tell you?  Listen.
No.  The girl.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Do I have any other choice?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Just take off the fucking mask!
You okay?
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
Mr. Kay, sir.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Does the yardman come today?
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
Mr....Kay?
Sit?
Six years ...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
I think about that night a lot...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
They gave you only four days?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
What do you mean -- ?
What for?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
What's wrong with it -- ?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
It just ain't happening --
Got it ...
Yeah.
You ever feel bad about any of this?
What color?
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
How are we supposed to--
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
You getting my checks ... ?
What time of year?
You sure you're okay -- ?
He's gonna kill you -- !
You?
Where'd you find this one?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
A distinction worth noting ...
What kind of trouble -- ?
Six or seven...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Now... I'm in ...
You think it can be done?
So what's in there -- ?
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Not really --
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
What bag?
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Who's gonna do that?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
Paulie was just talking about him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
I gotta talk to you.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
What happened to you?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
She's sharp as a marble.
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
When's the arraignment?
Why not?
How's the woman?
Gone.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
You and Morgan throw?
Why didn't you yoke him?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
Come on, Will...
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
What's up guys?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
What class did you say that was?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
No, there's a limit.
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
No students work for me.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes. Under two conditions.
That's right.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Shall we start the, uh...
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Find out what?
Good to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
Sean.
Tom.
You moved?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Now wait a minute--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Oh, that's nice--
He won't be a failure!
Hello, Sean.
I got one of those too.
How about one now?
What's the point?
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
You're right. I know.
What?
Nautilus?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
Why thank you.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Fine.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
Do you have a soul-mate?
They're all dead.
It's not...
You're Welcome, Will.
I'll keep in touch.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Yeah?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
I really don't 'date' that much.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
No I haven't...
Yes you were.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Why do we always stay here?
Want me to take a look?
Just for fun?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
No.
I want you to come with me.
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ready, Pa?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Want to work?
That's not your affair. Name.
Four.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Why ain't they more like it?
*You* find out, I can't.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
She's settlin'.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
I aim to.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Goin' far?
Been doin' a job?
Yeah.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Look, Ma!
Was Granma bad?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
They know he got hit in the face.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
He was a good man.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Yeah?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
You people looking for work?
You're so funny...
Insane.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
What's that?
Is it something you've done?
Get the fuck outta here.
Will you come with me?
What if I come back?
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Yes.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
Do you like the people you work with?
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
Okay.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
There you go. I left it blank.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
Well?
Wait a minute--
He using her.
All of it?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
I'm not happy.
He didn't.
In Detroit. This weekend.
What's it look like?
Jim?
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Ten years. What happened!?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Why not?
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Does Chicago count?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Son?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
I am comfortable.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Mom?
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Did he mention it?
Well, one was for salad...
About what?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
It's me.
What about Grace?
What did he say?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
What did he say?
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Yeah, what?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
What was it like?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
- See, what you can do for him --...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
Mmm. An editor.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
Are you afraid of anything?
No!
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
"... and I said that"...
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Damn!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Crash Override.
How did you know that?
What's this one eat?
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
He's not in this class.
What?
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Yeah.
Uh, hold on...
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
I know, I know who wrote it.
What?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Why did he come to you?
Shit!!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Never fear. I is here.
Die, dickweeds!
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
What is he doing in here?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Murphy kid turn you down?
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
555-4202.
Real charmer.
What?
Who's that?
Brady! Come with us.
How do we look?
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
We should call the fire department.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Outside.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Double scoops?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Come on Rachel.
Coming.
Jamie!
We'll hear sirens soon.
You don't believe that do you?
Why?
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Where are you going?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
This is starting to spook me.
It isn't a man.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Fancy.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Get him out of here!
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Promise?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Hello.
She's washing her clothes.
I see.
Come in, come in.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Mmm?
Yeah.
And then, uh, April...huh?
We're a big hit.
But I'm seeing him.
Right.
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Yeah.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
No?
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Why?
Lee... uh...
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Why not?
But, you got four children!
I want one with you.
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Yeah.
How do you know?
Absolutely.
Because I have to!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
Who is it?
Oh...
N-n-no, not that.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
It was on your shirt!
No.
I think they're fantastic.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Huh?
Mh-hm.
This is the second opinion.
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Frederick didn't come with her.
He's married...
Oooo.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Singing?
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Good.  How are you?
Oh, no.
Yeah, it was.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Nobody ever said it.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Oh, God!
Just a few minutes ago.
Thanks.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Aren't you glad to see me?
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
A reward...
They're offering... 
...<u>please</u>...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
...how are things at the Hospital?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
We could skip the Gavotte.
...they did it for a lark.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Bad beat today.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
And how would you know that?
...here's to child abuse!
Why?
For a consideration.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
...what's he got against you?
A fellow with five fingers.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
What'd you say, hon...?
Waited too long, hon...?  
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
I have had many excellent meals there.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
...how so?
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
No. 
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
The girl needs help.
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
What was it.  What was it, honey?
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
....because we don't have any mmm...
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Tell me why...?
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
I don't understand.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
That would be a No.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
What in the hell did you do that for?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Guess who?
No way, no day!
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Like a suicide thing?
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Mute!
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Did not.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
I guess.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on, sit up.
I'm not hungry.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
Who cares!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
I'm so happy to see you!
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
Hello!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
I'm coming with you.
Isn't it beautiful!
Your insight is enlightening.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Of course, yes.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Skin cancer.
Well?
No.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
GWEN?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Who's Allison?
You could say that.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
But... I thought...
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
You're alive...
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
What do you want?!
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Mister LaPlante...
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Bill, I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
The homeless!
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
What's the matter?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Never reach out!
You didn't?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You didn't... get it on with him?
I didn't ask him.
Who?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
No, no, no, no.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Isn't that always the way?
I'm thirsty.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Honey --
I know it's at the high end of our range --
And it's a shorter commute.
How were we -- were we cool?
What?
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I think it's time I came home now.
What?
Let's follow 'em.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Even cosier.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
What do you think?
Detective Bedsoe.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
Must you do that?
Sing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
That is what bothers me.
If it came down to it what would you do?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
Yes.
You can go first.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
I cannot stay.
Why?
Huge.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
To talk to you.
Where did you get it?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
No.
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
I've seen it.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
We found him this morning.
I don't think it is a duplication.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
I love you, Conner.
Fine.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
No.  The money, please.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
The best.
You should warn them, Sonny.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
We're fucked.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
It's over.  We have to give up.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
Okay.
I got the gasoline --
I overheard him with the girl.
Keeps to himself, more like.
Are you out of your mind?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I don't drink beer.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Now we can do whatever we want.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
Just one question.  Please.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
She didn't answer.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Are all of you named Jones?
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
We're okay.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I think so.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Are the disks still in your room?
Where's your gun?
Who are you?
I guess we do.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
And what will they do with these satellites?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
Whiskey?
Where are they going?
What do you mean, General?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
You are a marked man.
How so.
Where are we going, sir?
I would never do that.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
That will take time.
Call, sir?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
How much?
Pack the bags, we have to move.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Let's have dinner first.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Paul, don't let them die.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
What about us?
You could leave, Paul.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
So where is the lamb?
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What sort of car?
A Volkswagen.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
No! Sit down now.
Rutaganda's place?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
So what stopped her?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
There must be some other way out.
I'm sorry --
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
What is it? What's in there?
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
And we get this money when?
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
-- that's the fact, bud --
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
You okay?
What?
...Jesus H. Christ.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Asking the wrong person again.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
No, no, it's just --
Sorry.
Fascinated.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Rewind that.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Oh, no.
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Ghosts killed your father?
For the love of God....please...?
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
What do these ingredients mean?
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
It's going to hurt us!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
I can't move!
Good night Angel...
The place is pretty dusty.
It's just going to take a while.
God rest her soul.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
Oh my God where is she!
She's gone!
I'm fine.
Maura!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
What are you getting at!
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
So where is it?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Why are you so interested?
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
But you gave me a rose ...
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
You're apologizing?
I miss you too.
Really?
That was beautiful.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome back to Vinci.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
The C.I. what?  God, no...
I hope you know what....
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Something short.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
That smart?!
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
What a horrible little person.
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, I --
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
What a beautiful thought.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Now, Amy --
Norville!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
Well, I --
My pleasure, sir.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
But, buddy --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
...It is?
But, Buzz --
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Oh, geez.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
He don't look wise.
She isn't!
Thank you for waking me.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Alive?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Mrs. Rand.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
Yes.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
Mr. Holland?
I wish I hadn't heard --
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
Can't I take it for you?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I often do.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
You want that?
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
No thank you. We should be off.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
That shirt?
What's for dessert?
You think I --
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
A prior engagement overcame me.
Nah.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- 73
But...
But what?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You okay?
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
I saw you on your bike today.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
How'd you know?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Just be careful.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
I do.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
No one.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
With who?
Hey Sandy.
Yes, sir.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Do it again.
Who's playing?
I know.
What about your shoulder?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
What are you doing here?
Good.
What happened at that signing?
To do nothing.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
One of your cases?
Will.
Huh?
How should I know?...
You don't know.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Are you the leader of tis group?
I have not spoken to him...
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
But why?
That's what the one who made me said.
Yes... My God...
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Louis, I swear I did not.
I want some more.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
Stop her Louis!
Does it?
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
What plans?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Why does he call you that?
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
What do you mean?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
It can't be...
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
The girl, Lestat -
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Shall we go on?
It's over, I'm telling you...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
What can I do for you?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Say yes.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He does work hard.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
Karaoke -- perfect.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Nice move.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Ray, I can't...
I understand something.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I don't know.
Deep breaths --
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Ahh, that feels great.
Rio de Janeiro!
What's the matter, boy trouble?
You stumbled into my hiding place.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
He is exhausted.
Drunk again?
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
Her name is Thea?
It makes me fear her.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
But the war, the army —— they need you.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Made what?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Well, naturally. Of course.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Thanks.
What's that?
Hey, Ernie!
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Daddy!
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
She's swell.
Hmmm . . .
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
George! George!
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about –– build things . . . design new buildings –– plan modern cities –– all that stuff I was talking about.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Hello, George, how are you?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
George, can I see you for a second?
No, George, don't . . .
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Hello.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Pop!
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
I'd like to do that.
Yes, sir.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Well, hello.
Well, I don't.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
If I told you it might not come true.
I'll take it. And then what?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
When did you get back?
To keep from being an old maid.
Oh, George, George!
I've eaten.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
No.
Maybe by now they are.
Where're we going?
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Tina!
Happy to do it.
Chief?
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Mike's out there.
You're too close.  Back off.
Where to?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
You stay here a minute.
What else you got?
Wait a minute....
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Can't you tell?
Where the hell were you?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
It's good with coffee.
Eat Cheerios.
No.
Sean's asleep.
That you were fired.
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Anyone know what time it is?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Anything.  Anything.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Hurry, please.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
Figure they split?
What's the lighthouse?
He's got to help or it won't work.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
You're going out.
So?  So?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
What's your plan, Brody?
What is it, 97 days?
Where's the rubber band?
Damn it!
Hi, baby.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
You're going down there again?
Mmmm... you smell good.
... He ought to put him in here.
Hydrophobia...
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
Who's going to do it?
Go where?
I told you, something's upset them.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Let's hope he knows that.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Get ready to go.
She, Mister Hutton.
Don't blame yourself.
How long you staying?
Are you really?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
I don't know, what else is there?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
The space shuttle has landed!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I don't talk that way.
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Calvin said it was all right.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Oh...
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
How far away is filter number four?
What kind of trouble?
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Sure.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
He was doing his job....
Where are you going?
Like mother, like son....
How come it's my responsibility?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Where have you been...?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Henny Youngman....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
All he did was kiss me....
Stop what?
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
I'm not going to quit now....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
You hungry?
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
I can't....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
I'm fine.
I have my own little island.
Won't you get in trouble...?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
I don't know what the hell to say....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
Hey!
Maybe I missed you too....
Money is money....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
When I signed on....
You sure you've done this before?
How long have you known Hoagie?
I'm coming...How close is it?
I didn't ask you to....
You getting a reading on them?
Funny, Jake...Funny.
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Shove it....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Woman has taste....
Oh no--
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Not too good in daylight ..
You want my advice?
Maybe?
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
You don't really believe this?
What if we need a back up?
How do you know her hair's black?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
And did they?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
You must have some idea about him.
No.
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
No.
No.
Oh.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Two or three years ago.
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
You can drive down there, Sir ..
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Could you just stop moving?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
... this is... uh... too funny...
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Fine, I just --
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Why do you love me?
So this break... is a break-up.
What about medical?
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
I heard.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Good.
First you gotta tell me something.
Please, if I start talking --
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
Mmm.  Hmm.
You love me now, don't you?
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Damn right.
Jerry!  You made it --
Thanks for coming.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
How can I make your life better?
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
-- and I'll get 'em.
They do, my brother.
I don't see any.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
What did you say!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
That one time was just the bumper.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He could have died.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
How would you classify it?
NO!
Hmm?
Good luck with the fund raising.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
What did you think?
Know what this is?
Are you sure?
Bonitas.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
That's hard to believe.
Well that's good.
Any damage?
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
What are you talking about?
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
Oh --
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What?
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Our chance to do what?
It has a broken leg!
We can't stay in here!
Something's wrong.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
But why?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
WHAT ARE YOU-
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
How many lines of code are there?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Carousel.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Not just every six weeks.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Why not?
That's right.  Will break through.
Alan, listen to this.
Oh, imperfections?
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
I can't see.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
I doubt it.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
The kids okay?
Kids get scared.
What?  What can we do?
Hey, we were saving that!
For today, I guarantee it.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
What works?
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
John, John.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
That's not funny.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Fifty.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
That's not true...
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I don't know...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
A house?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
You watch this garbage?
He wets the bed?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
Insomnolesence...
There's a pizza place over on Market.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Uh-huh...
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
My assistants, I presume.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
You work in the cemetery.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
Will you do me a favor then?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
It's what I'm paid to do.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Was there something else?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
What's funny?
How long were you and Eduard --
When I have no reason to doubt.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
No -- not this time.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
No, I suppose not.
What makes you think so?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
Amerika for us!
What have you got there?
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Jack!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Man Eater!!!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Are you nervous Jack?
Are you gonna start it up?
Yeah.
Why? She's a junkie.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
I'd just be guessing.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Don't belong?
Sorry. 
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
No, that's not --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
My name's John Klute.
No, I'm look --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
-- OK?
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Can't you get him?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
He never told me.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
I don't see anything, do you?
Yeah, you got to me.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
-- Then you don't need me.
How?
We did this before.
Go down in my room.
I called Trina.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
OK.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Well --
What's in it?
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Mr. Kramer?
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Not particularly.
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Greatest.
Greatest...
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
You forgot the milk.
Okay...Same as usual...
That's okay.
I'm allergic to onions.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
No.
Is that...permanent?
I suppose...
How long was that?
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Joanna, I don't give a--
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Joanna, what the hell is--
Only can I still see him?
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
How many?
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
Things? What kind of things?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
How many onions does it say to use?
Three.  And add some basil.
Uh, huh...
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Ted, I just heard...
Kham, Holiness.
Again?
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
No.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
I will be back in a few days.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
No. Not very big.
Where is Alsace?
What can I do? I am only a boy.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
Me?
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Things change, Kundun.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
We have enemies.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
You have grown up very good.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Hmm.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
You're a beautiful woman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
You're crawling around like a--
They don't really attack underwater and--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
He never said "go".
No way.
I got something on the screen.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
I'm okay.
I <u>told</u> you.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
Oh my God.
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
We set?
I'm ready when you are.
What's that?
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
Did he say anything?
This is a little different.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
You like Jack?
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
I had a great time last night. Again.
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'm not even a field person.
<u>Kelly</u>--
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Backstabber?
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
No. He won't come after me.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Sometimes.
Get me out!
I understand.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Who's the subject?
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It's much better than your shoes.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I don't know. Is it?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Was it a butterfly?
Horses - and sheep...
Did he try to?
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Early. Still dark.
I heard a strange sound...
So you ran away...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Much further?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
No. I will find you.
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Fort Edward, then?
Who were these people?
That is sedition! Treason!
Where do we go from here?
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
For Munro children?
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
What's wrong?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
DeJesus!  A readout!
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
Can you fix it?
You did good...
What?
How's astronaut training?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Where's Doc?!
Okay.
Thank you, Martin.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
Yes sir...
It...almost got you.
Who cares?
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
What's wrong?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
A what?
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Can I help?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
The stupid bastards! Count it!
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
What the hell are you doing here?
You will what?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
I'll see ya.
I like your bar.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
How the fuck should I know?
The money, the gear!
Oh, come on, Amado--
I can fix cars.
I'm sorry, sir.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
No, sir. Not at all.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Yes, sir.
You're dismissed.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Colt Peacemaker.
A .45--
That's not the point.
I'm not picking it up.
No. You?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
No sir.
He a Black man or an Indian?
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
PDA?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
He's still pissed off about it.
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
You going to get married?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
We should just do it.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
That ring--
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
This girl has a child?
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
That's a matter of interpretation--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Right.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
I got an idea what happened.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Why would I want to go there?
I never said that.
You ever play one of these?
People didn't complain?
She finally got in--
Time marches on.
It was for personal consumption.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
We haven't talked since high school.
He's all yours.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Most people did, yeah.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
Yeah. It's quiet--
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Name's Otis.
Hello, L.A.
They go together.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
I could scoop them out.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
I'm no bodyguard.
I don't know where you'd start.
That's my business. Harry.
What then?
I was so afraid.
Are you sure?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
No!  No!  No!
... oh... God...
...yes?
Is it finished?
Oh God.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
You believe that?
Shit.
What for?
Yeah, I know.
Leave her alone --
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Don't bother.
You need an ambulance.
What?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Hold on.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Yes...
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
For what?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
And he didn't have them?
Yes?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
A couple of weeks.
What about Philip Swann?
What is?
Yes.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Hello?
What about you? Why are you here?
What do you do?
Of course.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Did I scowl at you?
You're possessive.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
That's too scary.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You think so?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
What?
Like Japanese food.
Oh, come on.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Hello? Yes?
Evelyn Waugh?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
Hair stuff?
Will you please stop smoking?
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Uh..thanks.
Peter, where are you?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I'm still shaking.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
I can take care of myself.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
What is it?
So...we won?
What's his name?
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
I had to.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Nothing yet.
What's the bible for?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
You have to say that.
He was trying to tell me something.
How much time do we have?
You know what?  You can go.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
What's the matter with you?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Nothing.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
I don't remember that.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
She's alright.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Wait...
Why not?
That too tight?
I found you someone.
No.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
What's up?
But?
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
For how long?
Way to hoop.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I don't.
Yeah.
Figures.
What was that about?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
I don't think so.
When did you decide all this?
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Not for Quincy McCall.
Tried calling you a couple times.
From basketball.
Then why are you so upset?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
We should head over.
Yeah.
Nona, please.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
What?
Okay.
How was your game?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Good.
Yeah.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
It was scary though.
...what the fuck is this...?
What the fuck do you want?
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Please put your clothes on, please --
You don't have a boyfriend?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Yeah.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Yeah.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Ready to go,go,go?
C'mon guys, settle down --
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Is it real love?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Yeah.
I need to sit down.
You do?
Where is he?
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
No.
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
Is that still lingering?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
It's all important --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
Hollywood, mainly.
Are you close?
I'm sorry.
people die.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
It's not your given name, right?
Kind of.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
How long...you think?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Oh yeah.
What? What? What now?
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
Marcie.
No.
...you know...
Then what?
Yes.
I won't.
I can't fuckin' do this.
How you doing?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
It'll take the pain away.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
Will that help?
That's it.
Do you have any children with anyone?
I think that you know.
I don't know what I've done.
Do you still have to do homework?
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Are you on drugs right now?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
mmmhmm.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Do you have that?
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
We need more dog food --
Should be one-thirty.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
God smiled upon us.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
I wish to discuss your brother.
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What are they doing?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
What is that?
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Who is he, Aramis?
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
And people close to him, who --
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
But -- what is Porthos doing?
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
A simple theological discussion.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
It worked!
But -- are you sure?
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is its antidote?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
What is that?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
Your Majesty...
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
Silence!  I order you!
... You knew you had a double?
... The ball... Continue.
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
What number, on the first page?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Captain Doyle?
You mind if I ride with you?
You set to go -
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
And who are you?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Something I don't already know?
Who is it?
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Donut?
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
I'm not going anywhere!
Are you going to be alright?
Where are you going?
I'm stranded out here.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
That was Peterson upstairs.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
I have to.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
What's one way?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Get me a plane!
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There has to be.
He's a very shy boy...
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
I'll take you.
Are you okay...?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Dr. Chilton.
Linda King's desk.
Why do you think I called?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What about the dog?
If I were?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
You haven't smoked in two years.
What's the problem, Molly?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
How?
You read about it, I'm sure.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
I'm sorry, George...
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
But wasn't it funny?
What, you don't think I can beat him?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Why Memphis?
It's me.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
"Burlesque"?
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Is he in his room?
Where?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
They are dead.  In either case --
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
He's gonna make it.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Sorry.
Five.  Since I've been here.
Are they any agent?
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Do you still want to meet?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
The Matrix?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
How did I beat you?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
Set down in there.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
What do you believe in?
Morpheus, I don't know --
Hello?
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
But what?
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Gee-zus.
What?
What is the Matrix?
Get this thing out of me!
God...
What did she tell you?
We can't leave him!
I'm going in after him.
I have to.
What?
How?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Operator.
Which way?  Which way?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Sounds good.
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Well, we want good stuff.
'And with your spirit.'
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
What happened to you Flash?
It's the truth, I swear.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
Keep your mouth shut.
What pipes?
What's a'matter?
How much was the original loan again?
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
Fine.
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Charlie...?
No.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Bore.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
I'm sleepy.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Hey... you got stereo.
Well...no.
You could say that.
Friends of yours Michael.
How much?
That's your name?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Who?
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
What is this?
Annie made them.
Red or white?
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
And what would that be?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
May I interrupting?
No.
Who are we talking about?
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
I'm all excited --
I am now.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
That's it?
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Are you?
'It's up to Joe', huh?
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
He said that?
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Oh yes, I do.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
You think so?  How do you know?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
She's in a great deal of pain.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
I don't know.
I am, too.
Did you like making love to me?
Where are you going?
You think so?
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning, Bill.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
Of course.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Uh-huh.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
You're violating the laws of the universe.
And I don't give a shit.
Uh --
What the hell do you care?
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Those were my words, Bill.
Yes.
Death!
You should hope quite a while.
I don't!
How're you doing--?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Eddie?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
You like him, don't you?
You mean like you loved Mom?
What were you going to say?
That's all?
Are you okay?
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Where's he going?
I don't know, I can't say --
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
How'd you know?
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
...We know so little about each other.
21.
38.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Amnesia?
Seen you together, that's all.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
What do the police think?
Who?
Where is he?
Yeah, I hated it.
What's wrong?
What does he want?
What?
They're not looking for him.
Did Teddy send you?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
How can you read that again?
Yup?
You're living.
Why are you here?
You don't know him?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Why?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
How do you know him?
It makes all the difference.					 *
Yes, I will.
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
He any good?
With Sonny.  110%.
Where's the new drop point...?
We're not certain...
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
I got the item.
My end?
We want it back.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
No.
What do you mean?
Good samba dancing...?
Zero risk.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Hola, chica.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
If they attack you...
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
What's our deal?
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
Where the hell are you, man?
Verdado where?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Eleven to seven he blows it.
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Yeah.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Oh, good...
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
So?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
You think I'm lying!
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
What for?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
And what?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I'm wet.
Hell, don't cry about it!
Thanks, Joe.
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Here. Don't even thank me.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Getchmis olsun
Looks like a cheap hotel.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Twenty months?
What?
Anybody bitten?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
Dad...I'm...
The Hilton.
Those mountains? are they?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes...?
How much did you have?
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Yeah.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
I want to cut his throat.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
What?
My passport!
You're ayip!
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
What'd the Prosecutor say?
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
What lawyer?
Yeah...?
We'll be back at the platform in...
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Please.
It didn't bite me.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
Peter-
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
What?
Fuck! It broke the skin...
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
You want to read it?
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
You want me to burn my book?
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
--not fair?
You can--you have the "gotta"--
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Well, it certainly says you.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, I know you've been out.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
What is it?
Hey, Pete.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Great.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
I thought you were over it.
Not much luggage.
How do you that.
To win?
Where?
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
More like two-two point two million.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
..or hard wired..
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
How much longer before you can reach him?
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Where's the bloody -
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
-- his left jacket pocket.
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
You mean it'll be difficult.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
That simple, huh?
Nekhorvich's boss?
Roger that.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
Do I?
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
To friends.
Did we get it?
I'm walking.
What happened to Jim?
Who is "they?"
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
The message is for Job.
May I come in?
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Okay...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Are you damaged?
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Yeah.  I follow you.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
That depends.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
We'll see.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
I thought I was going to see Max.
Then what am I doing here?
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
Loud and clear.
Jack...that's spying.
Such a nice ass.
Yes...  Itís him.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Yes.
Rose, pass the wine.
I have my eyes open.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Where's Ma?
Here.  Ti amo. 
What's your news?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
It's wrong to just let them go.
Excuse me.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
That's it.
Stupid.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I'm telling you your life!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
I've got you.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Don't just become excited.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
I can't!
But that's cause he don't know!
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
I'm afraid of who I am.
No.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Hi Loretta.
No?
I don't understand.
Yes, on the floor.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Alright. A month. In a month.
Yeah.
He's my younger brother.
Have you told her we're getting married?
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
Where you been?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
What? He's in Sicily!
He's with his dying mother!
What sins have you to confess?
Don't make yourself sick.
Talk to him.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
But why would a man need more than one woman?
I don't know.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Temperature's dropping.
People home.
I'm a little cold.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
You mean the whole house?
It's Cosmo's moon.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Where did you get the coconuts?
What do you mean?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
We don't have a lord.
I am your king!
Who are they?
Of course.
Yes ...
What is that?
What?
Then you shall die.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
You're a looney.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Hello.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
By what name are you known?
What?
Look, you're a busy man ...
It is the rabbit.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
Don't be such a baby.
Thanks very much.
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Gosh - Is he all right?
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
But I don't like her.
Who are you?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
If we ... er ... 
We're coming with you.
The Castle Anthrax?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Seventy a year.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Be careful who sees it.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Of course.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
What did you say?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
How will I know what she requires?
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
You're injured.
Was there never ambition?
Why do you think I keep her here?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
What are those?
Those, over there, there.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes?
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Well, both.
I understand he was in a fight.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
I have no idea.
Has anyone seen Greg?
I came from the city on the left.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Because I didn't know where else to go.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
SLIP-STREAM.
No I'm not...
You got the schematics?
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
Okay.  It's West.
The clock's already ticking.
Our time's up.
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Yes...
Then we'll go home?
But I don't understand...
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
So what do you think?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Someone's shut off my money!
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Howdy!
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
Yes...what is it?
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I told ya.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Yes, there was.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Maybe it's not me.
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Don't stop!
To my audition.
Yes, Sir.
What's  the matter now?
Oh boy.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
You feel it?
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Find out who they are?
Palmdale.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Leave him, he's dead.
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
We drown.
So why this ?
What do you mean ?
Where are we going ?
I work here, remember ?
Are you Matthew Parker ?
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
What the fuck are you talking about.
You okay ?
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Zachary.
Look he figured it out !
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
Thank you very much.
How can this happen ?
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Not now, Mom.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
You had to remind me?
Do you still teach?
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
THANK YOU.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
No nuns, got it.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
What're you saying?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
What are you staring at?
But I wanna write about her.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Then I have come to the right place.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Thanks....
Vada.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Get married?
Boyfriend?
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Give it to me!
...I dropped it.
Never heard of her.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
No?
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Muh??
They're great.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Then you'll be all set.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
I think this place is just fine.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Oh, sure okay.
Hey! Oh look.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh, how do you mean?
This is where we are.
Goodnight Shelly.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Can we see it from the back yard?
Ahem.
Dad?
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
When??
Yes..
I like the freak show.
What are you doing.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Did I kill my mother?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
No, no no....
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Please.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
No, I'm divorced.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
It's okay sweetheart.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
It'll bleed.
No.
You have no personality.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Why are you running away?
So now you'll have a mother.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
For what?
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Kindred spirits.
No, he's ruining yours.
I can see why.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
And you believe that.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Needing.
I did what I came to do.
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
Don't you have to be somewh...

Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Such as.
Hate that.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Big weddings are so strange.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Thank God you were here.
Uh.  I saw that moving...
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Lower.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
Maybe it's happy there.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
What?
Grand Old Opera --
Is there food?
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
I said, I've been real tired.
Yes.
He's going to run for president.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
Okay.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Yes, sir.
Replacement party.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
You in music?
Wrecks.
Parts.
Mom?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Bet the sheets are grey.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
It just is.
Do you ever do any writing?
Tom. You remember?
Who is thin?
I don't know who you are.
I have to go.
That's what you said before.
Oh.
Yes.
You sound different. Is that really you?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
How's your stomach?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Is that good?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
I see.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Naw, she don't mind.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Looked like an interview to me.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
You ready, Donut?
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
She sings? What does she sing?
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Describe Mallory.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
That's indescribable.
I could go for a Coke.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Mickey, you're wasting time!
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Hypnotizing.
Just for fun, I guess.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Two guys?
Don't call my men assholes.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Give her a beer.
Where' you goin'?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
You a union man?
Used to be. On the railroad.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
What d'you think?
Where was that?
Where's Wilma?
I don't know. He's your boy.
Guess I don't.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Yeah, I been there.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
What d'you mean?
You almost got into trouble back there.
Ain't your fault.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Just for the day?
I didn't know you had one.
Your boy.
What d'you mean?
Don't push me, Duff.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Don't call them that.
What about him?
He could live with us.
Is that so?
Everything you cook is good.
Am I as good as they?
You still didn't answer my question.
You know how to box?
Day work.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
How 'bout the key?
We was just leavin', fellows.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
That's right.
Want me to hold the light for you?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Sure.
Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Don't be too hard on him.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I doubt it.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Hi.
Let's stay here, Will.
What's the matter now?
Omar, listen to me--
Since when?
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
What are you talking about?
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Can you read my mind?
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
The access code to your mainframe.
You're pleasant tonight.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Case.
I thought you already left.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Why should I want to meet him.
How soon is soon enough?
That's not going to help.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
I'll be okay.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Is he going to make it?
My God... these people are insane.
What is it?
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Well, do you?
College?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Who told!
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Wow. It's packed.
But I don't want it straightened out.
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Rob's?
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Better than I...
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
wasn't even thinking about-
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
You like her?
So what are you thinking for college?
Are you--scared?
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Boys.
Why do you do that?
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
When are you going to open your eyes?
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
That is so sad --
Josie, you look Rufus.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Coming...
No.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Just out for a while.
Oh, come on Dad...
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
You two got a thing going, or what?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
You're fucked in the head.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
You know her?
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Any ghosts in here?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
What is it - What's wrong?
It's gone now.
Why won't you talk to me?
Who, Jesse?
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
What's so funny?
Morning.
Hi, Kerry.
Yor dad picking the music again?
We're going up to bed now.
Mom?
I thought I'd wait for you.
Watching TV.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
Do you still...see each other?
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
You like gymnastics?
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
What's that?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Those are ancient history.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Max, where's Kristen?
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
You're late.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
Okay, straight talk only in here.
How do we get in?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
That's enough, Kincaid.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm not listening.
And then I... right.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Really?
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Okay -- fine.
So who left who?
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
Eleven.
Well, get a message through to him too.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Wow.
What?
Undressed like this, yes.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Excuse me.
What does it say?
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Yup.
Still loves you though.
Do you want to stay?
What?
Bernie -- this is Anna.
And we intend to use them!
No -- it's my 22nd.
Da Vinci?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
I suppose so.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I believe I have.
No, sir.
Cool, huh?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
What?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Fabulous.
Yes.
What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Why?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Y-y-y-yes...
Yes, ma'am...
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
On this ward?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Welcome back.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Where ya goin', Mac?
There they are!
A pecking party?
Twenty-five dollars.
Okay, sucker.
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Yeah, it's cold!
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Ten bucks.
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Okay. How you doing?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
P.A. What the hell is that?
There they are!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
What happened?
He's dead.
Oh, yeah...
Your mother.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Excuse me?
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
No...
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Hi there...
Smoking or non-smoking?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Why?
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Well, good.  Good for you.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Hey--
You okay?
Yeah.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Really?...
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Yes?
What looks good?
Scientologist.
No.
So?...
It's still the new year...
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith--
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Yup.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
What about Larry?
What?  You know him?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
Where is she?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
Don't say that!
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Father Barry.
Hello, Edie.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What?
The Golden Warriors.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Wham... .
It's quite—  –nice.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
What are you crying for?
It's true.
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Pigeons... .
I've been sittin' in the church.
Terry— what's happening to you?
What I did to Joey.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Well, it's over.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Am I on my feet...?
Who is he, Pop?
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
—It started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
What do you want from me, Father.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I think you could have.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
I told you lay off.
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
So-so, Johnny.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
How'd you get that.
Listen, Johnny—
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
Leave her alone, I tell you!
Can't we get out of here?
Don't let them hear you.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
But they are not yet one of us.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Yes.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
You didn't visit him in prison.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
I don't know where he is.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Just that she got away.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Her phone's probably tapped.
Nice disguise.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
Two hours.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
Half for doing what?
Come <i>on</i>.
What?
I'm going back inside.
You talked to him?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
I have to qualify, is that it?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
You excited?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Ironic, isn't it?
How are you, Raymond?
No, I didn't know that.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Let's go outside and talk.
Why, are you famous?
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
That's my dad.
Unless you wanna tell me.
Those guys bother you?
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
Where?
So she did help you?
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Really?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Like what?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
Glenn, take the exit.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
Hi, Ray.
How's it going?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You not with probation, one of those?
No.
You a lawyer?
Here?  In this house?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Your dog was killed?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
I didn't have time.
What?
...the fuck is this...
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I got a half a tank.  You?
I'm out of ammo!
It's shorter than our practice runway.
How's everything?
Sorry.
So beautiful!
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
I heard what you did.
Bombers.
How'd you get this?
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
Let's go.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
That's disgusting!
I know. Put Scott through college.
How do you feel?
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Great, isn't it?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Oh, Charlie.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
What about Janet?
Oh, God, Dion.
I'll never give up.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
Terry, slow down.
I'd love to.
I can't do that.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Quiet today?
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
What do you mean?
I'm not the maid!
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
What's up?
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
Wbat're you talking about?
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
What will they be made of?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
What's wrong?!
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I'm not burying him here...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
It's weird...
What do you mean?
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Mom...
In a word, Bob...
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Allright. Calm down.
This time. What about next time?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
I'm not going to close the--
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
I'm not ready to die.
I know that, Charles.
Congratulations.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Continue.
We?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
They sabotaged me.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
You survived your first gay party intact.
I've considered that.
I know a good probate lawyer.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
No.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
No. I can't really see it.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Leave that.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
That's correct.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
I might.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Right.
Now that you mention it...
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
You came for us....
Tell me that was you.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Entered our minds.
Had it with deals.
What do you see? Riddick?
One or two.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
They're already dead. Get on board.
Just give me your hand.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Didn't bite.
Well, don't ask me to.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
We cannot go through there....
What, you're goin' off, too?
Company's not here, is it?
Owens!
Where's Mr. Johns?
What're you doin'?
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Say that again.
Think about that reward, Johns.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Said "looks clear."
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What's her name, anyway?
So much for your nightfall.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
No.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
No.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
I want her.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
I think you're making a mistake.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Read it yourself.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
What about it?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
You want her that much?
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
He's moving his fingers!
But the proof? The doll?
...but 'Lias is still out there.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
How the hell did he get away?
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Come on you can do better than that!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Yeah.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Must be somebody?
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
You volunteered for this shit man?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Found it. Growing in a garden.
You wanted to see me sir?
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
You don't want to hear about it?
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
Vancouver, B.C.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Immigration Officer?
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Dance? Tonight?
Dance? Here?
Us?
Why?
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
And Betty Mayfield--
Frozen.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Would I want to?
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
The police always do, don't they?
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
To do what?
You do things the hard way, don't you?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Who told you my name?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Round of golf Saturday?
You'd be breaking the law.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
How would you know, Brandon?
Recently, then.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
Open it and count it.
I've met her.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
Where's the shell?
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I am a fool.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
No doubt about that one.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
I believe you won decorations during the war.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Be nasty.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Shall we go?
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Thank you.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
...break away completely from--
Oh, but he was terrific.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Oh yes?
How nice.
Both dead.
Did she talk about me?
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Might?
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
To the Fleet.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
You're so gross.
Fuck off.
Okay, I will.
What about the Cromwells?
Not bad.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
You gotta earn trust.
You do it... you first!
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Wild ride, huh?
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
Surf conditions okay?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
This Zen master surfer.
Nothing?
Kid, get outta the way!!
I need you to teach me.
I'm serious.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What's goin' on?
Ouch.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
You're wastin' your time.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
You saw what?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
I like your hat.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Yes.
You looking' for some company?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
You're not from L.A., huh?
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
For the whole night?
Three hundred.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Off the boulevard.
Do you plan everything?
And why do you say that?
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Not... quite.
Where'd you learn to do this?
All right.  How much for the week?
All right, two thousand.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Why not?
You always been rich?
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Shush.  Of course you can.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Did you?
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
What time's diner tonight?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Did I wake you?
I don't think there's any sense in --
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Carlos had some great rock.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Who did you think?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
You bullshittin' me?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
What's your name?
I got a dress.
You'll like it fine.
They will serve salad.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
But you don't know where he is.
The body?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
Yeah. It's really good.
-- wait, just wait --
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Could this be a trap?
Are you a rotten liar.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
Get used to disappointment.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
You know what a hurry we're in.
You're that smart?
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Australia.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
"Of the silvery moon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Do the books!  Do the books!
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
You found a flop!
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
What are you doing?
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Don't help me.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Always.
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Get car.  Get car.
Feeling better?
We can't play today?
Wagner...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Okay.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
I mean in show business.
You out to buy a motel?
I'm not the police.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Not at all!
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She stole some money.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Please!
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
A good reason, I suppose.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Sam.
Where could he have gone?
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
It's regular. Okay?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
I have to go, Sam.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
I have?
No.
I've caused you some trouble.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Only my share.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Why don't you go away?
No, not like me.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
You're not going to... to your room already?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Crane.
Then I'm free to go...?
Wait a minute!
Why?
We have a problem.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Just coming up to ring for you.
It isn't necessary.
My mother is not dead!
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
No mother.
He's inherited a fortune.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Yes.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
I won't let you say that!
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
What do you think I am?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Meaning what?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
We'll grant that.
What!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Call the Homicide Squad!
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
But I have some friends waiting.
She is the soul of that statue.
I'd know him anywhere.
You did miss --
What was her name?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
What did it want?
I know, Mother.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
'Course it does.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
I said I wouldn't.
What was your mother like?
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Well... maybe...
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
I think Daddy suspects.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
She's watching the car again?
They're discussing it.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
No, Mother, he's lying...
So am I.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Of course.
I think we both know her.
What?
Oh. Did you say something?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
She does look a little peaky.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
Is anything wrong?
Got yourself up?
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
I don't believe it.
Galley proof.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Took your time gettin' here.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Rose, you don't have to.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Sons of bitches!
We should slow down.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
The booze.
What's mine say?
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
There probably is.
He tried to kill us.
There'll be other chances.
Our resignations.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You know what I mean.
Just got here.
What the hell's his problem?
I don't think so.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
I can't do it, Ben.
Yes, my Master.
As you wish.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Han!
The same as always.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Here we go again.
What did he say?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Ugh!
Quiet.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
I'm coming with you.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Weiss.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
From Transexual Transylvania.
Free to try and find a game
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
Looks quiet, y'know.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...What?
What're we going to do?
Christ.
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
What?!
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
How was the flight, Champ?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
...That's an old one.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
What?
I like yella teeth.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Why?
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
...What?
...No.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
How am I doin'?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
I'm thirty myself.
Maybe ya better forget it.
I'll do okay.
I got whiskey here.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Whatta these guys want?
To see ya train.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
A tweeting bird?
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
He's a riot.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
No...
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
So altruistic.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Have you got the will?
Maybe.  Why?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Wrong number?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Two bits.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
Have patience!
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Romeo will answer it?
By my head here come the Capulets.
In love?
Good heart, at what?
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
I'll not endure him.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
I take thee at thy word.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
A Plague o' both your houses.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
What?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not to me, you know that.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
We'll double your price.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
Nobody's going to do that!
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Is that right?
What a surprise...
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
I ride with fat-boy...
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Where to?
He says this is their block.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
I borrowed that, too...
He's going back.
Not exactly.
Do what?
What the fuck happened?
Business keeps you on the road?
What?
You better get some sleep, alright?
What happened to it?
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
Can you get it?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
At the expense of six people.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You think he's bluffing?
Well what are we supposed to do?
You're crazy.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Maybe we should say somethin'.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
OK.  I love you.
And I'd take it out on him.
How are we going to do all this?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Don't you have to be here?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Hmmm...
Have I seen her?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Uh...C?
Sure.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
A lot of men come in here?
Just goes to show you.
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
So be here at three.
Something wrong, Jesse?
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Well you're not getting, either.
You're never getting that much.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
And what happened?
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
No, sir.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
I don't think so.
This is your ship?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
You bring American money?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Not Yu.  You!
No.  She's a school teacher.
You're not very good at this, are you?
You said --
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
What did you say?
What's she doing?
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Get it out of here!
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Why did you help me?
Fine.
I think we should stop talking.
No.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
What about a little king pao chicken?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
What is Mac out?
Dancing?
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
That your gate down there?
This money is evidence.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Why don't you go get them?
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Master Ching taught me.
Baby Duck?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Sir, I can explain.
You talk very fast.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
-- what the hell is that?
I was being polite.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
It was not my intent --
Right....
What about them?
I know a shortcut.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, Lee.
Oh my god. Griffin.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
No...what?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Yeah. So why you look do down?
How about a lift home?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Where do we find him?
I do.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I still have work to do here.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Right.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Look, he's running after her.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
It's nice that they're still friends.
I think so.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
No.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Yes.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
Brian told you that?
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
A little longer for me.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Why?
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
Yeah.
Is there somebody else?
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
What is it?
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
-- it was a betrayal.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Right.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
No.
Men never get this movie.
Turn on your radio!
You were standing in the middle of the street?
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
You're going to miss the train.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, I know that part --
A sense of humor.
Go home for the weekend.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Magic.
Hello.
It's been about a year and a half.
I don't think I could really describe it.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
You'll find out.
It's Y. O. H.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Dad?  About last night?
Does red pepper go under R or P?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Great.
Not now, Jonah --
Jonah, I'm leaving --
It's only ten o'clock.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Who is Annie?
What if I couldn't get to you?
No.
Do you like baseball?
Hi.  Sam?
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
He's good at it.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
The woman question?
Forget it.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Be still ...
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Where's your mama?
The what!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
What?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
It's not that easy.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
How far out of town?
Like you?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
So, why'd you want to see me?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You wanna score some go-fast?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Palmdale
Why?
When? When did you ever see me use?
Make me an offer.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
What the hell is this?
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Cool it. We got business.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Danny, I'm touched.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
I was trying to score some dope.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
This the guy?
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
He knows somebody ratted him.
We know what's going on.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
There's no motels around here.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Where's Bubba?
Find a chaplain.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Jackson?
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
So, that's Ryan.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
I wasn't made for this.
I've been humming it.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
I wonder where they're going.
What about our grenades?
You?  Leading a squad?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
What about Talbot?
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
PUSH!
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You think they'll be alright?
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Bits and pieces.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Ours is not to reason why.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Here they come.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
Who cares?
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
Speak with my lawyer.
Thanks, I like yours too.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Look at those eyes.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
So, what's your point?
I don't feel anything.
I told him to be himself.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
You like it?
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Dad, I'm sorry.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
But I found the money.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Hi.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
You know what?
Then call me tomorrow.
Okay, bye.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  With potential.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
I don't think so.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah.
We'll see.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
We decided...
Just my dad.
You do?
I love you.
Okay.
YEAH!
Uh... okay... um...
The truck?
No, really.
She's very successful.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Give me my firebird keys!
I love you man.
Sir, the list is correct.
You know what, you'd like her.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
You want these people.
You're not telling me something.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
What's that?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
How many?
Good.  How's it going?
Thank you.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
What others?
Are you losing money?
They arrived.
I'll talk to you later.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
They've broken their pattern.
What is it?
I'm losing you.
Yes.
Cici. Who's this?
That's okay.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Why don't you ask them?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
No, it's not.
Need some help, honey.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
A twist ending if you will.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Dewey, there's no such place.
I don't play games.
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
Where is your attacker?
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Hello?
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
But...
What do you want?
Jesus.  Hello?
Well what number are you trying to reach?
More of a game really.
What?!
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Are you sure?
What do you know about trilogies?
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
What about me?
You used to say that was our strength.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Gale, your engine's still running.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
What'd he say?
I know!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Owwww...
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
It's on the table.
Now that it's out of your system.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
No...
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
Oh Sidney...
Or even a good porno.
You heard me.
Fuck you.
I think you have the wrong number.
Do I?
So why did you dial it again?
Who is this?
Just some scary movie.
I don't know.
So you better leave.
Where are you?
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Evening, ma'am.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
What are you doing here?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
You think he could still be in town?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
About thirty seconds.
Please. You owe me.
So who are you?
So where are you?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
She's saving herself for you.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
Are you serious?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Do they know who did it?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
He was there, Tatum.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Have you heard?
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Give me the gun.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
A woman...
Murderers like you?
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Somerset...
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Not here.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
It's a bucket of vomit.
No.
Same color and texture.
It's too soon for him.
Well?
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Forced what?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Nothing.
He just may be nuts enough.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
What are you talking about?
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Don't do this... please...
Oh... um, William.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
Perfect example.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
No sir...pleasure.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
You got any more orders, Captain?
I say NO!
Sir?
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Unnt-meah!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Easy on that!
Say it. We're beat!
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Good night...Laurie...
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
What are you doing?
Cherry-red Tears.
So, did you sleep good?
Where have you been?
Martin, what-
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
Ellen Straub.
Mrs. Straub!
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Tenth floor.
Ned…I know…I know
Yes.
Thank you, my lady!
Twenty pounds on delivery
We will all be put in the clink.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
And your relations?
It's a comedy.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter…Almost finished?
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Who is she this time?!
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
I did not.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
What? Who?
How goes it, Will?
And yours?
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Two hours at prayer!
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"Madam!"
I would not for the world!
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Will! What--?
You never spoke so well of him.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
Orsino…good name
But all ends well.
My lady Viola.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
And break her heart and mine?
Your aunt?
She sings too?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
A man, my lord?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Will you shut up and play.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
About what?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
That was good.
What's the problem?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
So I gathered.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
What?
That's all?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
So I gathered.
Don't.
OK.
Sshh.
Love and happiness for ever.
Will you calm down.
He can't stay up there.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
David?
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
No.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
What?
The perfect couple, I should say.
Can you afford this place?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I'm sorry.
No one. I promise.
Yes.
It wasn't like that.
Here.
Right here?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Exactly what I was --
You get the job done.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
What do you do?
No.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
No.
Working nights?
You know about it?
The first one was fine.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
No. I haven't seen them.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Your watch.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Yes, but... I thought...
Lester.
That's okay too.
-- is that what this is all about?
What are you talking about?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
She's got a...
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Is she all right?
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
You know what I'm talking about.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
No.
Are you in love with her?
Her?
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Okay.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
... just, you could look very heavy...
Then what do you think?
You are.
Right now?
Right, that's right.
Yes, Buffums.
Yeah, I think so...
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
George...
No! Don't! Please!
Sit down.
What about it?
No you didn't.
You were great.
Sammy's?
-- yeah.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- what?
Look who's talking.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- we are?
Why?
-- Jesus --
Please, we'll have to talk later --
No --
It's too late...
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
Don't leave me...
-- White ladies?
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, George.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You've never even been around one.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Egypt!
George.
Yeah, baby.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
What do you want?
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Yes.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
What difference does it make?
What did you say?
George...
What're you here for?
It's good you want to do something, George.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
-- yeah?
Well anyway...
Layered?
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
No --
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Sid.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Shut the door, shut the door!
I'd like a drink.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I'll call you.
Well, he is.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Five times a day?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
But why Egypt?
Oh. thank you.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
What's wrong?
Call me Les.
Dad?
I'm hungry.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
What?
No, Dad.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Danny, come here!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Oh,
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Sure is.
Yes...
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Wendy!
Stay away from me!
Stop it!
Stop swinging the bat.
Wendy...
Very nice to meet you.
Have any trouble finding us?
five months of peace is just what I want.
I'm intrigued.
I don't believe they did.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
What time does the plane leave?
The moon's not down yet...
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Are you all right, Marty?
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
What kind of noises?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Don't call me dear boy.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
What the hell does that matter?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
Yeah? Really?
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Yes, Betty?
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Chops?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Three years.  A rookie.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
She won't?  Why not?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Mary Clarence!
Goddamn it!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Very well.
Are you talking about me?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I got it.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
A vote?
But... wait a minute...
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Oh?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
He didn't do you a favor.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
What'd she say?
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Really?  Lieutenant?
Vince -- is she... okay?
Well?
A sweater.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
He's not like other guys.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
Many have.
They spend two days in chains.
No bleeding.
Bring him.
It is sacrilege!
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Do you have these persons' wills?
May we look at them now?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
What is the common thread between these victims?
Out there.  What do you see?
Are you familiar with magnets?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
What was she doing?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
This is farewell.
Climb up!
How are you?
If you want.  But...
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Why would you do such a thing?
No, but... why do you ask that?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
Blood.
What is so urgent?
And, what did he say?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Yes, actually.
Where?
What did you say?
No one will believe your lies, whore.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
All right then.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
What you got in there, warshing?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
I ain't sure.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Why'd you live there?
I reckon I feel all right.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
They still around, your folks?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Who did you kill?
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
What do you mean?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
No sir.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I never was no good with history.
I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Thank ye.
Do you have family here?
Oh. How about before that?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Yes sir.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Signs?
Why?
Yes.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Huh?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Yeah, I did.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
What do you mean?
Like what?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
And how much are these?
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
What does that mean?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
I figured he had a right to know.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Just passing through.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Thomas.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Eight-thirty.
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
You don't really want to know.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
You work too hard, you know that?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
Come on, just a little hint.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
How do you want that cooked?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
That's obvious.
Why?  If they could never take title.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
Well, what then, sergeant?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
And the next one...?
And the last...?
Did you say more?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
I have told the truth.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
That's when he fell.
What makes you think I play?
White or black?
You must think I like losing.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Well...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
I can't speak for him.
Improved...how?
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Such as?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
A what?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
With me?
Nellie told us about it.
You don't see any blood?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
My name is Josephine.
This way, Daphne.
Men?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
But this is so humiliating.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Oh - Sugar!
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
I'm not that sick.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
How's the bottle?
We better have a drink first.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Yeah - Josephine.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
No!
Did he get fresh?
How did those holes get there?
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
You invest in shows?
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Yes, Osgood?
Yes, Joe.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Bingo?
Really?
That so?
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
My fault.
That must be it.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Yeah.  Real hot.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Look at all that silverware.
It's the crews' night off.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
You poor, poor boy.
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Well - ?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Really?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
PLEASE!
Booze.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
You know what I love about all this?
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
Where’s Nick sleeping?
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
Hi. Hey.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
What does your gut say?
Who are they?
Not the way you’re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
This happened to you?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
I should go.
Hey, Sal.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
That's where we come from first?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Go on...
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Well, looka here...
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
You bet we is!
Goodnight, Daddy...
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
You know somethin', Daddy?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
When's that?
That's right!
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Yes, mam...
When you read it we'll talk about it...
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
Hello, David...
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Behold my glory.
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Okay.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Cartman?!
Mph rm rmph!!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
You've got a stupid accent too.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Viva la Resistance.
Uhh... I don't know.
What's a butfor?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
It's okay, I am done for.
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
Shiteater-
You're all part of Satan's army now!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
It's from your mother.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
You'd fuck your uncle!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Hey, relax guy!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
It's a little late for you to be up.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Why, didn't they say?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
You better start making sense!
Idiot...
It's time we lock coordinates.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Look at this...Jesus.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Really?
I can't let you do that.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
So what's going to happen to you?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Where's Taylor?
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Think he bought it?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Buzz Fazeli.
100 years! 
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
The small ball.
I'm your blood.
Don't say that about my mom!
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
We ain't married no more.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Junior.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Someone wants to play with me?
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
No!
What if he wants to get out?
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Leave him alone!
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Line up where you want it.
Like this?
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Won't your father help you with that?
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Do I want you?
No, I'm fascinated.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
It?
How do you get this thing down?
Where are you going?
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Very good, busyboy.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Your time is up, busyboy.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
I said back away.
That's our reserve air.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
What for?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Can you open that panel?
They've left, keep watching!
How much damage?
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Yes, Harry.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Radiation shield, you think?
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
To what?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
The library.
We have a library?
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
So what?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Don't tell me to calm down!
What?
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
You, me and Harry?
You don't trust me?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Squids?
You think, in the sphere --
But how?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
It's for motion sickness.
A synthetic opium analogue.
How do you spell it?
What's that?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
You're lying --
You manifested that, Beth.
I never went in that sphere.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
Is it?
Shut up, Beth --
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
What?
Would it work?
Then what is it?
What are you looking for?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Don't be defensive.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
What are you still doing here?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Did I?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Her suit's gone.
You didn't say that about the food?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
You know how to work this thing?
What does Norman already know?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Meaning?
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
What was that, sir?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
He wasn't feeling well.
You mean a picture?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
I know that.
You saw through me?
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
That's where my father was killed.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
The Kiber Crystal.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Well, I practice a lot...
We'll send a squad up.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Are you safe?
Something... I've got...you don't.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Your father will never let you.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Where are you going ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
He's nothing like you.
I love you, Carmen.
Do you mean it ?
Should I be ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Well, see ya.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Let's go.
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
May I ask Why?
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Programming ready?
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Granted.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
What answers?
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Then you'll be wet.
You bringing your new friend?
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
The people in New Hampshire.
You haven't heard of it.
What's it called?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
No, no, I see...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Goodbye.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Mmm.
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
No, I don't...
Hello.
Great.  Who is it...?
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
I used to go out with a politician.
What's the scene...
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
That's right...
Gosh, you look nice.
You know what else a man can do?
Oh yeah.
...and we could get up every morning...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
What are you going to do?
After Drama Group.
Hi!
Where have you been...
I have to tell you something...
Well, where do they hold court?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
He's on the ph...
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
What'll I do for fun?
Sure, what have you got?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
What else?
She's a...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
It's night.
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
I want you to hear this.
Who is that...?
We're just talking about the...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...wants a piece...
We, we have to give it.
An artist of your caliber...
I'm only trying to...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I'll put the, in your r...
That's cor...
That isn't very nice.
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Main Street.
...he's the producer of the movie.
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
Later for you, pal.
And what was it you wanted to say?
I'm looking for the writer.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
You should.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
I've got a date.
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
How do they know that, you told them?
I...
That's what I said.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
She wasn't in...you were al...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
She coulda done better than him.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Ben!  What's wrong?
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
That will never happen.
How would you know sh...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Like how?
Like a big sister.
I can't hear you.
You don't like his friends.
Not with my mouth open.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
But you told us to starve.
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
You say that like I don't know that.
Are you here?
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
You're WHERE?
Still, please.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
WE are over.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I have a snoop.
So why did y...
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Small world.
Moi?
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
It's the same choice you made.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Aw.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
It's just an assignment.
She's not gonna die.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Well, they will be.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Does Jackie know this?
What if he is?
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Thank you.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
I did not go to high school.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Nothing, I guess…
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Reconceive.
The same. Same as what?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Gee, you're home early!
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Uh huh.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Any books you like to read for fun?
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
I believe it.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
So where'd you get in?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
What is most important to you?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
I'll lead.
I said I'll lead.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
--be prepared.
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
How's the arm?
Come on, drink up.
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
I have your word, Mister President?
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Now, snap out of it, fella!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Yes, sir.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
You're damned right they are.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
I guess so.
Where, sir?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
And you'd like to see that?
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
How long will it take to receive them all?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Naturally I am, sir.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Roger, maintain.
Call them every five miles.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
I've got one.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Primary circuit is live.
Yes, Major.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Mn-hm.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Uh-huh.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
What's it about?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Your a nurse?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
No, no.
Sorry.
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Look.
Bullshit.
No.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Your his publicist?
In what way?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Oh, you were there?
Yeah, we're all above that.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You could do it.
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
He is.
Mm.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
I'm not a nice guy.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Taking care of business.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
I hit her.
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Please?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Oh! Trim it!
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Yes, I stand for -
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Yeah.
Okay, what would you have done.
What feelings?
So what do you wanna do?
Mm-mm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
What?
Where are you going?
Wait. What, what are you saying?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You're unbelievable.
No, it's not...
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah.
So you think I should?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
I hope you're happy!
Is that your driver?
It's pretty exciting.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Me?
You do?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Whatever.
It's none of my business?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Another sex dream?
Spit from your dad?
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Is that you down there?
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
My best friend got pregnant.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
Roll 'em.
Let it ride for a while.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
This is Miss Kramer.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
I was afraid of that.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
You sure have.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
It's just impossible.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Second generation, huh?
Nice job.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
What assistant?
We've missed you too, dear.
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
Or shall I call my servant?
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Fair enough.
Well?
This is fascinating.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
They've come for my car.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Good night.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
No, they don't.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Wanted what?
You are not dressed properly.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
What doctor?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
What does it mean?
She didn't take it from you, did she?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
When can I see, you again ?
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Let's talk about us, not her.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
I don't love you any more.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
Miss what?
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
Guess! Go on.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Yes.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
How'd you do that?
Lucy; come back!
Nigel, get lost.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
You...um...you never got married?
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Uh-huh.
Kent!
Do you really know Superman?
Say!
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Who gets it, the company?
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
When?
And then shut down the pipe lines.
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
For what?
No, we're just going down.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
There's no rush.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
I can't see anything.
Where's the light switch?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Okay? Goodbye.
It could make weather!
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
He's the only one who can operate this --
I do?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Who ????
Oh Clark, no!
Lois, I . . .
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
What else could I do?
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
. . . Superman?. . . . .
I'll try to remember that . . .
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Does Lois know about this yet?
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
Genius!  --  Lex.
It's beautiful.
Artemis? Do you read me?
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Constantly.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
So --  I hope you like it.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Who is this . . . Superman?
Yes?
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
I'm sorry to see you go.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Daddy . . . ?
Is he for real?
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
An angle?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
You are . . .
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Are there any more at home like you?
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Stop him, Clark!
Know what?
Huh?
Oh.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Jealous? Of what?
What'd you call him?
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
What are you doing here?
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Bet he makes it.
See?
I'm going to bed.
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
You're not going to hit me?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Tea?
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
-- as we will be.
He will be odd, different.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
You think they're strange?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
They'll soon be over.
Which one?
I understand.
Are you sure?
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Billy, please.  The children.
She's resting.  In her room.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Why not?
Because it's what we have to do.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You believe that?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
Did his parents attend to that?
Yes.  He does.
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
Excuse me?
Anything you didn't understand?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
Away from your crazy Mom.
No.  A little sugar though.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Yes.  It's a present.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Crafts.
Is this it?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Daddy?
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
I tested positive.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
What is it?
Is there shrimp on it?
Excuse me?
No.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Yes.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
You mean it?
Great.
Yes.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
Sidney is a liar!
Who said Sidney?
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
You print them, don't you?
Are you finished?
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
What would you think of me if -
If that's for me, tear it up!
Take a top coat.
What's the matter?
That's no way to talk...
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
It is a favor, isn't it?
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
J.J., if you think -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Steve, I...
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Those lying motherfuckers!
We should abort.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
You sure?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Everything.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Drive for a minute.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
Can it be destroyed?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Are you afraid?
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Yes.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
and totally irrelevant.
What?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
Furtwängler's in a different category.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Yes.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Steve Arnold...
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
No!
Yes, von der Null.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
What?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
I've remembered something else...
One of your people told me.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Who's he?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Alright!
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
There's so much...
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Molecular-memory.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Is this enough?
I bet you're ticklish.
I don't think I like this.
Sarah.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Give me the short version.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
I just called.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
Admittedly...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
What?
Don't just stand there, get help!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Where are you going?
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
You're the one who started running.
Nice.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
They're watching.
What are you doing... ?
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
I'm back from the dead.
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
I didn't know what else to call you.
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Like what... my favorite color... ?
One brother, one sister.
Boyfriend?
For you.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me.  Call that number.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
You dodged a bullet.
The phone's dead.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Robbed?
Have you gone to the police?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
What's all this for?
Oh... it's a game.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Is everything alright?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Anything wrong... ?
Nicholas...
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Well, I... uh...
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Why?
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I don't know.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
When do we take the tests?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Is there something about the house?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
What do you do?
No.
What's his first name?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
What kind of food?
I'm sorry.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
No reason.
Terry Valentine.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Huh?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Really.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Why did you come here?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Been busy, have you.
It's been a while.
That's not what I heard.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
She never told Eddie, though.
Modelling.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
I bet.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
What do you think.
You don't seem bothered.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Just now?  Overnight?
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Fancy it?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
So what's your beef, pal?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Good luck.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Where is he, then?
I miss my kids.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Ann--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
Huh.
You're an enthusiast.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Right! Strictly business.
...You bring a check?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
How ya doin', Ed?
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Your place?
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Huh?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
So... who... who actually--
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
No thanks.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Uh-huh.
...You sure, Eddie?
Huh?
Yeah.
...We goin'?
Yes, sir.
Not an owner.
Homicide.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
It better be good.
Why not?
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Fifteen... what's next?
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
The sub-basement?
I smell it.  It's here.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Dr. Green has to see you!
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
What's that?
We will.
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We're not supposed to go back there.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Argo!  Hobbes!
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Eats them?
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
How about lunch?
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
What is it doing?
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
We're not going to make the storage room!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
That's right.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
What have we missed?
Cue music...
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Are we talking Emmies?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
No...I, er.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
What're we doing here, Truman?
Well, what do you think?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
I made macaroni.
Good night, Mother.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Oh, my God!
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
Well, I made it through another night.
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Special Agent Scully --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Working with?
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
I'm looking for him.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
Have you examined them?
Who sent you?
He just let it explode.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
I'm on the roof.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Where are you, Mulder?
Why?
They were the ones that put us together.
Get dressed, Scully.
According to this tag.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
Been where?
Where'd they go?
Just like that --
Scully --
I can't go any farther.
Well, call General McAddie.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
...give a kiss to Edward.
I realize that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
Peter, okay?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
He's mine?
Who says?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
What about the legalities of this...?
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Nervous?
Any psychiatric medication?
How's the patient.
Now?
Here he is.
We proceed assuming she is.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
They're forged.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
I'm so sorry.
What's the matter?
I'm going back home.
A parrot...Let it go.
That's his headache.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
He works in a military hospital.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
...to him.
What the devil?
Win what?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
You do!
They wouldn't know me.
Heard of Harry Lime?
What do you want me to do?
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...the best way one can, you know.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Kurtz.
Yes, it is.
Something wrong.
...this time.
Should I make it all fact?
Richard. Hi.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Why?
Yes.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Two.
Hi.
What's a fascist?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They sound like you.
What do you care?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You will.
Too difficult?
Disease? What disease?
Which is what?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
What's it mean?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
I don't know. I just want to try it.
You gotta get out of here.
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Listen to me....
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
So what Jew would you kill first?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Who knows what that is?
Get out of here....
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Why me?
Leary?
Howard Stern.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Does he know?
What kind?
No!
Good afternoon.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
You're right.  You're fired.
What was he like, when he was little?
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Is he alright?  What happened?
What's with the voice?
And... does the voice come back?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
It's okay.
Your mother?
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
What is it?
You still collect them?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
We saw each other a little while ago.
Lucky I was there to save you.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
How are you?
I got fired.
So have I.  ... Hello?
Then, tell me a story.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Why?
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Why is he doing this?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
But we're not open on Sundays.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
A stereo type alarm system?
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
The death card - -
He will be waiting...
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ——
Oh, that's so interesting!
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
It was you, Galbraith!
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
That might depend on where you’re going.
When will they be back?
And that is the last time any...
I found this at your brother’s.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Is there anything to understand?
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that?
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Get to the point, will you...
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Your secretary, huh!
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
I take it your son is called Leon?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Let’s go.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
This car needs petrol.
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
Evening. Table for one?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
It’s wet. Will this do?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
Is she on the phone?
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Five seconds. Then you die.
What sums?
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Cost what?
What do you think?
Very generous of you all.  How much?
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
And I would like to see a priest.
Who do they think I am?!
What did they say?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
What's going on?!
What... what do you mean?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But it is what I want.
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I am ready now...
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
Am I... am I dead?
Where... where am I?
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Not long ago...
What did it tell you?
Many things...
Yes...
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Thanks be to God.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
If there was, I didn't see it...
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
No...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Yeah...
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
What have you done to me?
I don't know... I thought...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
So your memory's coming back?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
But you already confessed this morning...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Hello.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
How long have you been married?
Will I still be able to play?
Have you seen this?
Tough luck.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
I was listening, Kitten.
How long have you been here?
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Where are you hiding?
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
Yes, like a cave.
Like it were a piano?
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
She looks tired.
What's he say?
You have to wash them.
Wash them again.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
We can't leave the piano
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
Then why ain't he dead?
We cleared 22 here.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
They're still looking for him.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
Why?
I never played for winos.
What do ya mean?
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Raise 1,000.
See and raise 1,000.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
What the hell for?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
I feel lucky tonight.
What do you mean?
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
Get on with it then.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
You want a drink or something?
I'll make parole.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
He was?
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
You know how they are... sex...
Said he stole his invention.
Mind if I look around?
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
No.
I didn't.
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.
Yes.
Yes.
Your father?
She... she fell over backwards.
What would your mother say to that?
Only in bad weather.
That woman!
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Who's is it?
You've been there?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Well, what?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Why, you said...
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
I never had it.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Perfectly absurd.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Isn't that my drink?
What are you going to do with it?
No.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
I'd like to see you work.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Who gave it to you?
What's the matter with you?
I don't believe he did it.
What are you going to do?
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Nick!
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Why not?
The suspects!  They won't come.
Mimi...
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
Yes.  Nick!
Bonds, sir?
Maybe she has.
Home?
Where were you going?
Baghdad.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
You just go when I say go.
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
What happened?
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
I have to answer him.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
What!?  What!?
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Oh, that's fun.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
...I know.
What do we do with the Humvee?
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Where you going?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
They're going to kill us!
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I don't want to die.
I pick that way.
No!
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
Is that good, or bad?
The...the gold...
Yeah.
Thanks.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Epps?
Australia.
Woods.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
You get it yet?
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
What do you think?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Drug evasion with....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
I don't know.
What?
Don't take anything.
It's the end.
We're leaving.
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
How do you know?
What?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
And you are...?
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
You guys seem pretty tight.
Your partner?
What's up?
Bev, you're the greatest...
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Why are we stopping here?
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
Mike...
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
What's this?
Yes, sir.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Well, have you found it?
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No!
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
You're looking fine, Major.
Like it?
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
What is it?
Just as you say, Doctor.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Gaston Monescu.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Certainly!
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Now, Lily--
Lily, you must listen to me.
But, Lily--
Yes.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Peaches and cream.
Oh? 
This used to be my secretary's room.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Then a little nap--
Hair?
Marvelous.
Talk? About me--about us?
No--yours, madame.
Any minute I want!
Thirty-three--
Call the police?
Yes, Gaston?
I don't believe it!
What is it, madame?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Two lumps, madame?
Yes, madame?
But you're the more intelligent one.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Who's the best? Say it.
None of the stewards have seen her.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
I make my own luck.
We're too late.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
But I was with him the whole time.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You know somebody?
How you two doin'?
Bollocks.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
No you won't.
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
It is that simple.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
And...?
Fabrizio said you might be up --
You're trembling.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
April 14, 1912.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Sure!
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Oh--a hundred times--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
Montana?
Married?
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
What?--
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
<U>Me</U>!
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Why?
Sure, I'll go.
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I should say not.
Where do you live?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Are you happy?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
What do you mean?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
What's he got that I haven't got?
--And he has sex appeal.
So what?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
You leave the kid alone.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
I was in his cabin--
Nothin'.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
What d'you think of the singer?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
He said to turn loose of him.
I asked where you got him.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Forget it.
Excuse me?
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
How you feeling, Doc?
Not exactly...
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Very instructive
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
But Doc-
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
I laugh sometimes
Just doesn't, that's all.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
No really, I can stay a while.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
'Least you admit it.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
But -
Sir Elliot.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
What - no lust for adventure?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Political considerations?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Happily.
... Kids?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
No?
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
What do you make of all this?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
You won't get away with this!
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I'm worn out.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Good afternoon, ladies.
You must have done something to her.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
You can bring ONE toy...
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
What happened to you?
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
What?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
A lunchbox?!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
You are a liar!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
It's Sid!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
A sin against <i>what?</i>
I want to go home.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Victoria -
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
What?
Carl --
That's frustrating.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
So's the video camera.
Not yet.
What if every country legalized at the same time?
You can't make me.
Live with your parents?
In school?
Private?
She ain't in on it.
You may speak.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
That's good coke.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
What's your name?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
My work keeps me young.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Who do we interface with on their side?
What?
I'm sorry.
Where's that?
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Out.
No.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
So why have you told me about it?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Following the game at all?
That's nice.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
You Only Live Twice?
You don't know, do you?
Roald Dahl.
What do you mean?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
What?
You're all hear.
It was my fucking television.
What was your price?
But you don't have the money?
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Sounds great, Swanney.
Yeah.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Six weeks!
What do you see as your main strengths?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
A Federation starship.
What's going on?
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
What do you know of my pain?
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Who is it he reminds you of?
To land any closer would risk detection.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
I did not.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
I am here, Captain.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
You are mad!


And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
I belong here.
Are you embezzling?
Dillinger?
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
How's it going upstairs?
For being on to Dillinger.
Hello, Alan.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Right on the money!
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Who is your User, program?
Where did you hear that name?
How about over there...that empty memory?
You're alive!
Then...
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
What about our friend - Sark?
There's another beam!
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Yes, MCP.
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
New guy...
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
You've grown, big program.
Where are you off to young lady?
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Okay, Dad.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Station wagon?
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Put a tap on her phone.
Guy's a spook!
She's still at my house.						*
You tell on me, I tell on you.
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
My husband is a good man.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Uh huh.  Okay.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
So what's your angle?
You working on someone right now?
Get going! 
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Who is this woman?
Not yet.
Tell him we gotta go.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
There's nothing to tell.
Where are you from.
Very much. Now, where were we?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
That's a long time.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
What?
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
Yeah.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
It's great to hear from you.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
You goin' out?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Where?
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
Look, Dick, I don't -
No. No, you don't.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
No. Not yet.
I can, but I don't.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
I don't believe you.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
Just put it in your purse.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
That's him.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
Meaning...???
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I need to go.
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
I don't understand what we're doing.
I don't know -- I don't remember.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Excuse me -- what did you say?
Plan?  What are you talking about?
But you know what's real now?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
He's been tested for drugs?
Nine thirty
That a fact?
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Where in Mexico would you like--
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Time.
What time is it now?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Hey.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You son of a bitch!
Two-hundred.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
I want my car.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Genuine Draft?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
They look nice.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What does it look like?
I'm just going to my car.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
I got it.
No, I've got it.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Games?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You love him?
No.
How far is it to California?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
What?
You heard me.  Count it out.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
I'm her husband.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Wait a second--
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would I what?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
I was hoping we could talk.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
No.
You didn't kill her?
You know what I mean.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
You expect me to believe that?
Mister!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
You've got to be--
Bobby Cooper.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
Shhh! Liar.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Yep.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
What the hell happened to my car?
Hundred-fifty.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
I call the sheriff.
Accident.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Nothing.
I'm sorry...
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I wanted to talk.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace ... Grace?
I can't see it.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
But I thought --
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
<u>Jake</u>...
Where ya goin'?
What'd you say to me!
What's the matter?
How old is Jeb?
Four.
I'll keep it in my office room.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Think carefully?
Why?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
No Jeremy.
That's great.
Is that right?
How are you feeling?
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
Well, go get it then.
No?
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
I fined 'em instead.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Shit and fried eggs.
Yeah?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
They really got all that money, them whores?
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Did you... kill him?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Maybe I ain't.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Huh?
No.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Well... I don't recollect.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Shit!
Better re-load it.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Say, Bill...
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Well, she...
You ain't like that no more.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
HEY.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
What is it, son?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Jesus.  You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Jack. What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They ruined me tonight.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
What is it Keaton?
Ready?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
What do you mean I can't see him?
When does he post bail?
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
Why lie about everything else, then?
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams...
Nothing.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Say it.
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
I know of him.
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
Hold on a second.
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
... and you're going to do that?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
You know what happened.
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
What is it?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Hello, I'm calling from...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
And are they going to get it?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
It's over!
He's not in, Sir.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
...I have to stand up for her...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Been a long time, huh...?
I can't talk now.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
You use their witness.
The Doctors.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...yeah...good...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Mrs. Simmonds.
We, we were rather busy...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
What happened in those three...
Huh.
No.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Well?
I -- I --
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Did she hurt herself?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
You won't have to.
Your name. And --
Why?
Judy --
Well?
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where had you been before?
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Wander about.
Some people prefer it.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
-- talking to you...
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
How old?
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Long ago...
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
No, never!
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Is there something I can do for you?
Carlotta Valdes?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Sorry, old man. Work.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Pop Leibel.
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Where?
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Well...
Can we have it by tonight?
The stripper's here.
I have plenty of friends.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Wait!
Are you sure this was an accident?
There's more.
I'm calling the police.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Have you ever done this before?
I am not flexible on this.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Don't snap at them!
Later.
Don't ever stare him down.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
She's not here.
Who?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
She's still working?
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
I'm calling the police.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
Easy Boyd.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
And what happens when you can't?
Israel doesn't have a King.
They need leadership.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Easy Micheal.
We're goosed.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
What?
Government cutbacks.
Can't we do it on the phone?
I think so.
What do you mean, you think so?
Photographer?
Yes.
Don't you dare.
Right before the wedding?
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
You expect more what?
Time out.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
With all my heart.
Seating problems.
I need your help.
I need your help.
I love you.
Okay.
The chairs.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Do you love me?
What are you talking about?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Everything okay?
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
What does that mean?
I'll take a ride.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
Did she believe you?
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We will.
Shut up Micheal.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
You must think I am a monster.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
But what can I say to her, sir?
That's fifteen by seven?
Me?
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
Nothing.
If you wake first, wake me up.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
Me, rich? Come on!
How much do you want for him?
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Stop this!
Very, very?
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Don't talk like that!
What?
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I should have told him.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
I'm still making adjustments...
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
It feels so.. .real.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
SID —— NO!!!
A little less than yesterday.
John died.
Go to hell.
I am impressed.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
You know I am.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Nice work.
Lindenmeyer?
How's your pulse?
Where's John?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.

That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...

It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?

You sure about this FAA announcement?
Alright. Why so pissed?
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.

I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
I don't understand.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

...I can't make it tonight.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Hi.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Anybody want another drink?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Thank you Jenkins
Jenkins!
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
What?  Tony and China, together?
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
No.  But once I heard...
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Who's idea was it?
Then why did you?
Your husband?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Hello?
What?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Yep.
Seance.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Oh God...you knew.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
She's awake.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
It's just us now.
Did you...
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Why?
But what if something happens?
Norman, you have to look at this!
Hi.
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
A flare?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Are you lonely?
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
We had a seance.
I...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
What?
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Adamant.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Rowan...
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I under5tand.  All the same
I had you sent away.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Michael...  Do what you can.
You're very clever, aren't you...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
Go away!  I don't want you here.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
Only you...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Rowan Mayfair.
Papers...?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I'm sorry?
So what do you do?
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
It's been what, three years?
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Dr STECKLER?
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Hurry.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
So that's a maybe?
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have changed since second grade.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
You're way ahead of me again?
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
It's okay. You need me?
I-I don't have the keys.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
James, what are you doing here?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
Your article sucked.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Wow...you clean up nice.
I see.
It's all so complicated.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Maybe someday.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Rules are rules.
As much as possible.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
Really? You'd do that for me?
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
What are you doing?
People pay good money for that?
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
And where might that be?
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
She still work there?
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Did he come in with you?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
What?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Okay, what's the matter?
Kelly.  What is it?
What?
Hello?
And you believe her?
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
You think that's wise?
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Will they?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Jesus, man... You okay?
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Sandy... What's up?
Jim West.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Is this leading somewhere?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Prepare what?
All that jumping and kicking.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Well... that, too.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
What's this?
When we find him, he is mine.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
I know!  I know!
My God!  He's so excessive!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
He calls it the Tarantula.
Anyone?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Your private train, sir.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
They're coming.
You managed alright.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
I can't.
Why not?
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Sorsha.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Watch it!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
You must learn magic.
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Ouch!!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
How reliable is this kid?
Oh, he's good.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
It's all over, Paul.
Who are they?
Two days.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I was being foolish?
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
I got there late, John.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
You hear me?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
John said you're Amish.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
You are acting like one!
He'll live.
Uhh -- yeah --
If any!
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
How did you guess?
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Oh, my!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
I have so got brains.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
To Oz?
Here -- here --
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Real courage. That's what we want.
Ah --
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
That's right.
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Stop pushing!
Where -- where do we go now?
Why don't you try counting sheep?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
You don't get around us that easy!
No, her dog!
Animals that -- that eat straw?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Yes.
Oh - look out.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
The plutonium is missing.  They’ve taken the core!
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Old friend?
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Consider me ungrateful.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
Oh my God...we’re buried alive...
What is it?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
What are you talking about?
He used your exact words.
I could have given you the world.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
What class sub does your nephew run?
Someone will come.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
God isn't there to do it.
Hi, Jon.
I could stay and go.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
-- What is it.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Antarctica??
They're following us.
They're practically on us . . .
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Coward.  Giving up.
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Why is that?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Hey, you're good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Are you alright?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
We'll have to go after them.
You can't talk to it?
What are you doing?
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
Nice hops.
What's the deal?
That's the guy.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
What's wrong with him?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Were you now?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Where am I?
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
Don't you knock?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
How?
Is that what you're looking for?
Is that so?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Yes, sir.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Yes.
I hope you like large weddings.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Does that mean you love me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Darling!
Love me?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
I suppose you're right.
Well... we'll see.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Are these your bags?
Wockers with the knockers???
Did you hear that strange music??
Taking the book along?
What a filthy job!
How?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
No, no!  That whole thing!
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
That sound good, boss.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Get the sedative ready!
What's that tune that you're playing
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
And look at this, Doctor!
I thought it was wonderful.
Do you think you can sing it?
I'd be so nervous.
Give him the sedative!
Good night, Doctor.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
What?
Why don't we talk inside?
It wouldn't be fair to her.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Are you ready for me?
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Food!
Do you have a reservation?
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
