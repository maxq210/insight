Cameron.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Wow
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
What?
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Let go!
I just wanted --
Patrick -- is that- a.
How many people go here?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
Will Bogey get bent?
You told me that part already.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What've you got for me?
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Who's that?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
You didn't
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
I told you
Sure, I do
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
The duck?
Is that a request or a command?
Answer the question, Patrick
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Is that right?
Why can't we agree on this?
Was that your sister?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
In the microwave.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
Your life, and that of others!
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
There'll be a time.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says...
How did you manage it?
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
What are you saying?
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You tell that to them!
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Now I become custody of police department?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
You better get packed.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
I let her take a shower.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Yeah, right.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Takin' a bath.
Yeah.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
This isn't homicide school.
My folks are.
Two heads.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright?
Stop it.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Could be Leon's.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
That's good.
Yeah.  I promise.
So what's unique?
Okay.  You ready?
Are you married?
Hi, I'm Honey.
Where's Czech girl?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
I did.
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
What was that?
He's my collar!
How did you start the fire this time?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
How long they been livin' here?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Your doctor?
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess not.
What is it, Hal?
The antenna has to be replaced.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I'm having a party tomorrow.
How many days until you come home?
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Any clue as to what it is?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
That's true.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yeah?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Pay money?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
Here you go, baby.
You're done.  End of story.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
What are you talkin' about?
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah...
That's what you say, Cates...
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Thanks for the coffee.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
How ya doin'?
Rosalie, you okay?
How you doing, man?
Corn-i-Lius?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
No thank you.
So you do know her.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
And then?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I don't have time... I need to know.
I was talking to the cat.
How do I look?
The Fifth Element...
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Other than that... You all right?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
30 seconds...
...Hi.
To save the world.
I'm not going.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
It's up to you now, Angel!
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
Staedert, do you read me?
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Your clothing reeks of it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
Bullshit.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Is that him?
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Any good?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
I told you, I don't know.
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Keep moving.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You're making me very angry.
You're asking me why?
Give me the film.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Remember me?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're learning.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
It won't work like that.
Okay...
Hello... ?
I don't understand, who are... ?
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
It's been six years.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Yes... I remember Mary
Do you know what happened to her?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
No, you may not.
You alright?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
You in a hurry?
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
It was Freddy.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
But how...?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Thanks for everything, Dad.
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Very funny.
But Dad --
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
But how are we gonna --
I've got to write some of this down.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Mark...
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
What about down?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Why do you say that?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
But - what can we accomplish?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
See what?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
You don't believe me?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
Yeah. I know about that.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
I plan to. Soon.
Yeah?
What happened?
Yeah.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Like you and Gordon?
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Yeah.
You know.
It's not that.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Pop?
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
So?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
Lillian!
See. Get your boots.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
You okay?
Yeah.
Said what?
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Who are you?
Marg!
Jack?
Yeah.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
There was something. It happened up your way.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Money.
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
I'm sure he's busy.
I'm sorry, honey.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
There they are!
Who's flying the fucking plane?
We don't know that.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Can we do that?
But they start executing hostages in
That's affirmative.
Dead.
How many others killed?
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
Someone should give you a raise.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
We're under attack.
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
This is the President.
What?
What's the story?
Yes I did...
Shut down accelerators.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Elaine.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
I don't want to hear that word!
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
You folks need any help?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Then Elaine was right.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
George Zipp said that?
Can't you take a guess?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Rats! I've lost number three.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
We'd better get back now.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
In there.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Yes.
What's this?  What's going on?
And that fits?
Back off, George.
Was.  Divorced.
Your health...
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
How potent?
We?  You've taken it?
We all did.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
But there's no more drug.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Yeah, Sykes?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
What?
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Position?
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
Ripley...
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
That's right.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
One of us?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
Yes, Hicks?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go!  Let's go!
Ellen.
It's inside the complex.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Yeah.  What?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Are we going to sleep now?
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
How many colonists?
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Maestro.
No.
In a harem.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
I want to go!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Stop it!
No! No! No!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
There's a young girl to see you.
What does she want?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Yes, my love?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
These are originals?
What?
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Am I interrupting something?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Hey!
Behold!
Gertrude!
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Yes?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Who told you this, Majesty?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Yes, what about him?
Why are you here?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Papa!
Father -
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Opera? Opera!
What?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Well?
What?
Yes.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Ah!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Of course not.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
What work?
Where did I stop?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Do you believe in it?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Yes.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
I think so.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
On the contrary.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
What do you want?
So?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
And do they believe it?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
What?
Yes.
Oh my son, my poor son!
Exactly.
I've seen the manuscript.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
That lady is back, sir.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
He said 'Jack'.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Did he say a wolf?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
What do you dream about?
How old are you?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Will you come with me?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I would think so.
Anything.
Okay.
I should be committed.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
No what?
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
I looked.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Alex?
What are you going to see?
Yes.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
Hello.
It's a five-pointed star.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Oh shit. What is that?
Where are we going?
David!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
If I was still alive, I probably would.
What about the zoo?
I could hang myself.
Remember the Alamo?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
What about?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
know, but—
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
What?
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Now?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Yes, of course.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
If he can do it, yes.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Yes, sir.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
The ten dollars.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
They must have turned him down.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Yes, why?
He was here?
Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
—for the rheumatism, you know.
wasn't anywhere near this place—
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
We got a problem here, brother?
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
What have you done?
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
You have no shame.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Dammit!
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Both would be nice.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Strategically.
On account of we're robbing it.
What is it?
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
You've killed your fair share of men.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Zee.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Yes ma'am.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Thanks.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Thank you.
Lyla Devereux.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Really!
Good.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
Sir?
This is him.
So you can't tell me anything?
So he's won.
In English, Pinkerton.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Eight?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You and...Luis?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Evelyn?
Yes, I am.
We never really shared one.
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Carnes? Wait.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Patrick? Is that you?
What?
Like what?
Leaving what?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Two at nine? Perfect.
Late?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Jean-I'm not-
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Don't tell him you're here.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Oh no, I'm okay.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
You sure?
Don't you know this?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Oh.
What?
Have you consulted a psychic?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
That's so typical, isn't it?
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.
Speak up. Come on.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
I'm just screwed.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Isn't that -- extreme?
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
They hack into people's programs?
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Milo?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
That'll be a test, won't it?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Milo?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
What?!
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Who's that?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Well -- you sent for me.
...Worse?
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
What'd the girl say?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Every entry was authorized.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
...Milo?
Who can we trust?
Do we post it on the Net?
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
How close are you?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Why were you so careless?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
...He knows.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Or sometimes not at all.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
We won, Austin.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Hey, Mick!
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
I hate having my picture taken.
Oh, yes you are.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
What is it now?
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
What about his teeth?
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
Well, it's kind of weird.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Promised? Who promised?
As you see.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
I resign.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
You.
Valentine, listen to me ...
The result would be ...
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
But why? What's the point?
And I suppose you're the knight.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Did he say who?
I must say, you look more your old self --
This must be the last straw.
You followed me.
Orders.
No trouble.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Winning isn't everything.
I told Mother I took care of you.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
What's that you're wearing?
It's called Black Leather.
I'll be back ...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Our chaperon.
We want Mrs. Peel.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Insane ... ?
Why?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Are you alright, young man?
You with Mother or Father?
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
John Steed.
One shot -- for emergencies.
You are, and it's behind you.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
I've decided not to run for President.
All right!
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole, we've got to talk.
I'm going now, Cole.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
That feels so great.
You better not have too much joy.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Your mother's not dead.
Let go of me!
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Hookers beat you up?
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Are any of those right?
Rick!
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Oooooo.
How'd it go?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
You're late again, Rick.
I don't know.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Biggest in two battalions.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Been ripping off fire stations?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Hey! You don't know me --
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Brian, look --
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
Thanks for calling.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
How's it going?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Thanks for the invite.
Homey.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
What is --
That's a dumb thing to say.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Trychticholorate.
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
I want another shot, Sir.
Are you still here?
Glass?
But he killed these guys.
No.
Yeah.
Four months?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
So, you surviving without me?
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Coffee sucked.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I'll be there.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Knock it off. Now.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
Yes.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Yeah, him.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
No offense.
How much?
Nice to meet you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
But the line has to be drawn.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Go on.  Good so far.
Yep, you guessed it.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Nobody told me anything.
Manray!
How did you know?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Sounds risky to me.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
So you have your small victory, now what?
Thanks.
This is crazy.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Same thing Giuliani said.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
No.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
What do you mean?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
To come back to our roots.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
You tellin' the truth.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I heard ya lady is wild.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
What do you want to know?
Oh you do, huh?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Where are you bound for?
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I don't know.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
I believe they will deport you.
Then you yield to me.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Why are you shaking?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Good night, my little darling.
Yes, he's fine.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He loves me, as I love you.
Bill Styles...
Who?
You killed him you fucking faggot --
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You smoke, Ray?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
That'd be my reaction too --
Do what?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Why?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
That's exactly what he says about you.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
I didn't kill him --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Why?
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What I said before --
You think you could explain all this to me?
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Move him.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
What is that?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Little bit.
So what now?
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Really.
West?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
We just want --
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
Sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Yes.
You won't find a better place!
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Really.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
I never knew.
You were talking about your wedding.
I can.
What's your name, Giant?
Karl.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
Am I?
I'm sorry.
Oh.
How can I convince you to stop?
I was drying out.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I don't believe it!
'Fraid so.
How did you know my father?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
I do.
It's bad.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
I talked with your father last night.
They met at Auburn.
Mmm, what?
Do you love your father?
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
No I don't.
The sets were good.
Say thank you.
Ch...
No.
I...
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
No I don't.
Fine.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't hate you.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
What?
I wasn't saying anything.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
You know you can come under the blanket.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
What does it mean?
My name's Sophia.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Sure.
What happened?
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
You gonna steal my truck?
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
The fuck you laughin' at?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
I don't fuckin' cook.
Could you do somethin' for me?
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
By myself?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
You need some weed?
Shit. Who hasn't?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
What'chu sayin'?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Are you wasted?
Holy shit!
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Got in a little accident.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
Thought you had a man for that.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Nick... You up?
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Short shift?
All right, how's the new partner?
Know her?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
I'm not drunk...
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
I want to yank Kobo.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Start it.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
What's that for?
You all right?
Don't give him any more.
Ich said you left.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Don't be an ass.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
I don't remember saying yes.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
What's this?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
You want him dead too.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
When do you deliver your project?
Just thought I'd...
When?
Yeah.
She's not with you?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
When might that be?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Next.
You want to see my friends?
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Taffey Lewis?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Is there anything else?
What do you want me to do?
Did you cry when your father died?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Ten years.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
A tortoise.  What's that?
How come you were in my truck?
What's your name?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
You want to go home?
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Dickhead?
So far?
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I think it's the eyes.
Watching television in color.
What?
How long would you need me?
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
My Mom and Dad.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Name it.
Why?!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
May I please be excused?
The guy with the underpants!
Yeah.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
I like her.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
You wanted to see me!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Uh-huh. Adam?
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
Are you all right?
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Tempus fugit!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Yes, father?! Yes?
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Russia.
When did we get it from them?
Juneau.
This must be very new.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
I'll be all right.
Well, where are you --
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Really?
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
To go up.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
What?
Yes!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Get the presents and do the lights.
How long will you set it for this time?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, what do you think?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
What's that mean?
What's it to you?!
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He didn't leave with them.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
I've seen a few.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Yes.
You did? A human ear?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes?
Why do you do it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
You're all through with this now?
Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Hi, can I come in?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
You like to open me, don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Beeeee careful.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
There ya go.
What?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Maybe so.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Where are they?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Yeah, but.
OK.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
You worry about me really?
Okay.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
There's ways around that.
Are ya ready?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
What?
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Mother, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
No ma! No!
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Absolutely not.
Nervous?
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Rule of thumb?
Uh... two shooters!
Of course they were. How many?
The what man?
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
You bet your ass he will.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
You know them personally?
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Open it!
What do you want me to say?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
OK. That's wrong.
Why?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Is it back in?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
Like he meant it.
Yeah.
What's wrong with him?
I keep it for emergencies.
See if mine are in there.
Hi.
May I have a word with you, please?
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
He went back for his brother.
We said 48 hours.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Why don't you come with us.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Our money situation is not good.
I know.
I know that. But --
I want you to look at this.
Who's Mr. Henry?
OK. Mark that down.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Do you like Inez?
Yeah. As a girl.
Who tripped the alarm?
Where's Kumar?
I'll get him.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
Pretty much everything.
Does it float?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Yeah.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
What?
Bob, where you going?
No, I don't mind.
Let's not even talk about it.
No.
What?  What?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Well, what do you think?
Where'd she go?
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
This could be a trap.
I'm going back.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Come on in. What you been up to?
That's OK.
Where's Applejack?
How long do you have to go?
26 weeks.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
What do you mean grammar?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
You like Chicanos?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Will it track back to us?
What do you mean?
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Who else knows about this?
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
That's not what happened to your parents.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
Is this really happening?
What do you want?
I'll get the book.
But we were so careful.
Where --
-- where? -
I love you, too.
A Russian?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Who's going? Us?
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Alright... take it down.
Show me.
Here?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
I don't want to leave.
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
We must sue for peace.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
He was a modest man.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
What is it?!
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
That's just a dream, William!
They're coming!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Where is my son?
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for accepting.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
I must... consult with my father.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
What happened?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Sure...
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
What?
Get out. Both of you.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
So how's Tommy?
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
I know, but...
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Are you okay?
I walk differently?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Ha! Where's that?
Because you're... different.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Listen to me good, Evan...
Meant no offense.
I came with Captain Renault.
How long have you been married?
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
What is your name?
I see.
No thanks, Carl.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Yes, something.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Please.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Yes.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
And I said I would never leave you.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
This time they really mean to stop me.
I must find out what Berger knows.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Did he give any reason?
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Be careful.
Yes.
Rick? Who's he?
Hello, Rick.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I understand.
Yes.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
-- Thank you.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Is that a serious offer?
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Oh, thanks.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Give me another.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
I don't want them here overnight.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Just a little something of my own.
Can't.  Need water.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
It's real.
Nothing out there but ocean.
You know what happened to this?
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Oh?  You've tried?
No.  that was the last one.
You?  Personally?
I had it on the island with me.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
It means a lot...that you came.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
I'm touched.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
It's me.
I beat the odds!
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
To life.
May I ask, where are you bound?
You weren't dreaming about me.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Where's Mandalay?
Oh...
I better go.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
I *know* this was right.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
I know, I'm sorry.
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
Nobody special enough, Curly.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
What's an immigrant?
Have you enlisted?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
What about the trees?
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Where'd she get you?
First pregnancy?
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
It's obviously an aborticide.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
I'm not in trouble.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
That's it.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
This has to happen fast.
Grifters...
Nice.
I was doing it for them.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Who's that?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Whoa. What?
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Masters of our own destiny.
Jake...
How much we going after?
I have a good crew.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
I think I just broke my hand.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Oh Jesus!
Says who?
What?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I don't trust anyone.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
How do you deal with --
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Glenn talked you out of it.
What about...
We're getting a little old for running.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Aces, Suits.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
What?
Speak.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Did he buy it?
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
My car's in the garage.
I'll take you up on that.
I got scared.
How about five hundred.
I want a job, Giles.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
You really are a beautiful woman.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
You're my prisoner.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Tension. It'll go.
I loved it blond.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Nothing about you.
I want to buy a car.
Great.
No.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
I've lived there.
To coincidence.
In the casino.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
I know that. But you can now.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
She's my baby.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
You want me to check?
How?
Very impressive.
Does he win?
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Exactly.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
And you can only do it once, right?
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
-- Remark.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Not now!
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Yeah?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Negative effect.
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
How I make my living, what's your point?
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
I'll make it worth your while.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
What a creep.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
You're a thief?
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Lemme get my coat.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
How much do you know?
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
I don't know what to say.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Any idea when she'll be back?
Look, I don't know what you want--
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Nothing on Hannah?
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
How's this about me?
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
She's got my word.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
What if he's on the level?
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
And why should she?
--a philandering pig.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
For a change.
Huh?
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
More than anything in the world.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Any luck?
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Could be.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Oh, hi, mom.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
That's it?
A bustier?
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeah.
Good MORNING!
Hi... what's going on here?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Like a DeLorean.
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
How old is Grandma Death?
Wanna walk me home?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
With, like, images?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
My mom is gone.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Do you get to meet Ed?
So how was school today?
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Where are you going?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Cellar door.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I don't own a television.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
How are things going at school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
What else makes you feel regret?
Then how is time travel possible?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Her name is Gretchen.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Frank?
Our son just called me a bitch.
It is a big deal.
How did this happen?
Kitty...
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
You're what?!
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Huh?
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
That's it, I'm goin'...
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Yeah...
And the bite marks on my ears?
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
You don't know where this is gonna...
Yeah.
The bitch.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Nothin' too showy!
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
What!
We need more bars!
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Take a letter.
"My dear President"...
"My dear"...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
Hey you!!
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Oh no, I can't do it.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
Oh, Rufus!
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
I thought everything was working out fine.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
You won't be long?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
That I am very little different from him.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Yes sir.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I say Freddie, what are you about?
She's very pretty, your mother.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Alas, no.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
How awful for John.
Yes!
Say "Mmmerrick."
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
You look splendid, John.
That's a canopy, John.
How is your tea, John?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Who are they of?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
I've heard.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
I said welcome.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
But you LOVED her all the same...
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
Do you believe I love you?
No... no...
But --
I shouldn't have come.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
How?
Would you like us to sing to you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Yes.
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About raping me?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
What a stupid idea.
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
Halfdan the Black's here!
I... I... KILLED her...
It's magic.
What "magic"?
So?
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
You're wasting your time.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
No, I'm not.
Let me go, Sven.
Who's that?
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Sh! Hurry!
Shut up!
Made by YOU, Loki!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
There is nothing we can do...
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Dad!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
And you've got BOTH axes?
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Yeah, you told me that later.
And I just liked you so much.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I'm not nuts.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
So you like bookstores, huh?
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
You like that?
I don't know.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
You just say. I'm not really --
Thanks.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
No, not at all.
That's scary sounding.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
What do you mean?
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I love her.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
What are you doing?
I knew.
It's dark.
So go.
Make love?
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Doesn't sound like me.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I just got in.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Clementine.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Yeah. Cool.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
It's stopped.
Where?
You better go.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Nothing.
Then why did you ask me?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Alexander Pope?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
Stan? What's going on?
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
You can if you want.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
What's your bartlett's?
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
What was that?
Clockworks.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
What is Debbie's position?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
How does she like what in bed?
What guy?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
What are you doing?
I have to go, Julian.
Thanks.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
A job for me?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
From what?
What?
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
Coffee.
No, he didn't.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
Please... kill...
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
What's on your mind?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Jesus its huge.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
...how's the client?
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
We're leaving.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Sir.
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
That's an affirmative.
It tastes bad.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Miller, come in...
I'm on my way, Starck.
Blow it up?
He's been past Mars?
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Can you see a body?
He's engaged the override.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
What happened to his eyes?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Where is Reed?
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Where... where am I?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Back it down, Johnny!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
What is that thing?
You two need a time-out.
What are you doing --
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Front page?
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Yes, thanks.
What? What do you mean you --
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Why didn't you say something?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Ben's still out there --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
On the ledge?
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
Hey, Mike?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
No.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
And they don't call my parents?
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
I thought he was out of town.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
So what did you do?
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What's the big deal?
Just kidding. About 10cc.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
He's not coming.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Well, you'll find out next year.
This is a nice car.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Two Cokes.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Where ya comin' from, young man?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Oh, my God!...
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
When does this thing stop?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
What tape?
Jesus.
Lucy.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
We can't risk letting them in.
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
You got something better?
They're right here.
Just an observation.
What's in the back?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
But --
You wanna see, baby?
How much you got to see the show?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
What?
What's going on between you two?
Max?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Shit!
COME ON!
Hey!
I admire your strength.
What're you doing?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
I'm not!
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
What's up?
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Get your clothes on, lady --
You learn your lines?
Fired?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Were you a drug addict?
Thank you, Ralph.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Oh, Kurt!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Why?
Okay then...
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
...So you think I should go.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
That's right.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Yeah.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Fine!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Your big speech?
Mama...
But they're using you!
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Mama, what's...
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Don't... talk crazy.
Mama...?
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
What?
Symington says...
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
No!
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Then why weep for him?
What kindness?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Yes. Very close
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
Materials. Nothing more.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
And if I consent?
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Nothing. Still nothing.
God took her from us.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
I give you my soul...
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Henry Clerval.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
Only you would think of that!
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
You've been going round-the-clock?
No. They don't.
Thank you, Henry.
I have always loved him.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
How is it you come to be here?
Ah. An explorer.
I heard.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
It still hurts?
What'll you do when you leave here?
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Somebody's there, Barry.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
Holy shit...
Ned!
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
It's just a dream.
Whassamatta?
Cowboy.
Anything else you want?
Another coincidence.
You said it was just you and your son.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
Why do you want to stop?
He's running the show.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Jacob.
He's my son.
Who's this?
Auto wreck.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Real McCoy.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
I promise.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Not good enough, swear to God.
Do you believe me?
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
Yeah?
No.
Feels good.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
She's in the other room.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Richard!
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
This ain't the time.
I don't know, you just passed out.
I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
That's what you think?
I'm lookin' scared?
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Don't say my name.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Thank you, sir.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Pardon?
So I'll get a fair shot?
Ah, c'mon...
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Come on, Montgomery...
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
Which is guy-speak for...
That bad?
Me?  Why me?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I saw an article...
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
Which is guy-speak for...
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
And how do you know that?
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Who is it?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
I just wonder how that happened.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
Nesting?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
How do you know?
Who was that French guy, anyway.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Wish me luck!
This is not the place...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Have them sealed off.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
That is our job.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
It's the French Secret Service.
Sure.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
Come on, old friend...
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
Go ahead!
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
What the hell is going on?!!?
He wants to THINK!?
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Brandon.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
Systems register functional.
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
How do you remember this stuff?
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
It's suicide.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
...Okay
They're still behind us...
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
What?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
How does the rolling help, actually?
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
You're kidding. When for?
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
You have ten seconds.
Yes.
Stop, please! I don't know!
But what if Sarris survives?
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
"Deception..." "Lies."
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Oh, right, sorry.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Find them.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
A lot of years have gone by.
Yes, general.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
Yessir.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
What is this?
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Gag on your own invention, then.
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
The British army, sir!
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
No, please; an advance on your salary.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
I'm very aware of that.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
What else?  From Virginia?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
You know very well who it is that I love.
George, you know I only love you, but...
But not more than your comfort.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
It's the freest land on earth.
What are you doing?
They can use their imaginations.
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
What about him?
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
So you didn't have the key with you.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I have to ask you for that key.
What's this movie you're doing first?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
In just a second. Two...
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
You positive about that?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You serious?
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Sovereign.
I want you to.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
The shylock's the good guy.
But you work for the casino?
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
We talk different?
Wait. How about this?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
I got you a copy of the script.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
You sure?
You bet.
What took you so long?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
What day is it?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
So we kill him?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
Mother fucker!
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
I think you know.
The radio!
Yeah.
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Any dizziness?
Headache, nausea, lights?
Did you see him?
The guy. He just came this way.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Collision? With what?
It's not gonna hold us.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
We hit land.
I think I see it pretty well.
I must be in the wrong business.
You're up late.
What now?
Say what?
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Are you still looking for a job?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
But I can't --
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
Uh-oh.
Well, yes...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
So Josh...
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Yeah, right...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Okay, okay!
Look at how cute I am!
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I want to "make love" to him.
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
What's he doing now?
Are you sure?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?
Let's go hassle Josh.
No way... when?
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
You're just jealous.
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Don't worry.
Go ahead...
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
Hello?
What happened to Seymour?
I don't believe you.
Why? What did he say?
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Do you want anything?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Well, we won't keep you.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
What?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Yeah, sure... very funny....
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
Why?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
What? You're kidding me...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Just someone so young...
No, of course not.
In what way do you mean?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Can you at least let me in?
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
I have no idea - I just want to...
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Seymour?
Let me see the sick.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Pleasant journey?
I do need to see Starling.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
I'll be bait alone?
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Did it look like this in your mind?
Why so many?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Do you ever see him?
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
No, you didn't, Frank.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
You're really good, you know.
Good-bye, Peter.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
Is this the spot?
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
I know.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
Hello, Venkman.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
So far so good.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
I'm Egon --
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
You got a flux and a half.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Ready?  What is it?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
You heard it?
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
I am Zuul.  I am ...
That is one speedy mutt.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Are you Peter Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
All right.  What is it?
Circle?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
I've got to sleep.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
No sense worrying about it now.
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Then you'd be out of a job.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
You're hearing about somebody else.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Where are they?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
They're studying with Cynics.
I can see that...
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Are you going to graduate school?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Yes.
Elaine --
I'm meeting someone.
Where are you meeting this person?
At the Zoo.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Here he comes.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
What are you going to do now?
Yes.
Tomorrow?
Yes.
Benjamin?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
You're not one of those agitators?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Did you get a room?
Give me an hour.
The Singleman party, sir?
Yes sir?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Is it a girl?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Oh my God.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What do you think?
Sit down.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Won't you unzip my dress?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
What?
Let me out!
How are you?
May I have a drink?
Did you get us a room?
Well -- do you want to go up first?
What?
Thank you.
Yes?
What?
What?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Anything. Anything at all.
How do you get out of the house?
The driveway's on my side of the house.
What?
Now let's keep going here.
Are you shocked?
Oh my God.
There's nothing to tell.
Benjamin?
What?
Don't start acting hurt.
May I stay then?
Promise me, Benjamin.
No -- actually I'm not --
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
You believe me, don't you?
-- worried?
Thank you.
I know.
What?
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Now look -- please --
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
The Carlsons' are here.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Not now.
Why?
You can't.
I'll pay you back.
What?
Chasing around.
That was lovely.
Would you like to make a man happy?
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
And then --?
How tired you are!
And...?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
What can you see?
There.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Very early in the morning.
Why later?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
No -- not at all.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
I must have made a mistake.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Send his bags up to my room.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
Oh, don't go.
I never danced before -- in public.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Later?
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Can't you understand me?
A thousand marks -- 
Come here. 
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Yes --
You see -- what we are interested in --
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
You wanna talk to me straight up?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Roy Dillon.
What's up?
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Not as tough as you, huh?
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
I just came back from Phoenix.
And Myra's stuff?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
That's right.
I can't. I just left home.
Her job.
I want to know everything about you.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
I'm a salesman.
Myra, I'm not following this.
Upstate.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
What?
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
I'm happy the way I am.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
What?
Mr. Simms.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Do you know who did this?
Another historical inaccuracy.
No shit?!
Nothing's missing?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Nothing.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
He found you, didn't he?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Where'd you get it?
I can see that.  Why?
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Looks great.  It does.
It's not going to happen.
Hey, you alright?
What?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Keri, you all right?
What is it?
I have to pee.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
He do that to you?
Mom -- Who is this?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
But I've seen him!
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
But surely Rogers isn't --
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Home, sweet home.
How all the magazines show tits today.
I didn't tell you everything.
Go home!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
You know what gets me?
Months?
Could have happened to anybody.
When?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
You never played a violin.
The posies are for her?
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
For Africa.
To make an ass of yourself.
What went wrong?
Sir?
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
College!
It makes life spicy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
Uck.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
They're not engaged.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Will you go to bed?
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Dad?
Who was it?
What's this?
No.
Can I help you, sir?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Shouldn't you lie down?
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have some change!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
Go on.
You learned this in some college course?
And no one's there now?
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
Two hundred years old.
Just one favor.
No you don't.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
You've killed women?
Ooops.
It's always locked.
We'll miss you so.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
You've been bitten by bats?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're a son of a bitch.
Cut me open.  Find out.
With spittle?
Don Quixote.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
Was I ever of use?
I'm utterly satisfied.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Thank you--for my life.
What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
You don't know?
What will you do, Colonel?
Yes, he is.
Is Norbert still here?
Then who flushed the toilet?
What's his name?
That man is your father.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
What does he say to do?
It's fine!
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
What then?
Yeah.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I'm sorry.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
I wish Paul luck.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Is that a fact?
Not true.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
It's good.  Let him go.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
No.
You mean I'm black?
No, just not the type.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
You want a tip?
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Man, how many girls do you need?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Overpowering?
Yeah.
Three hundred?
I thought you were going to bed?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You know what I'm talking about.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
What do you care about?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
What the crap?
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Where does he live.
They are the same.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Where is he?
Well, what do they know?
Andy.
...What do you have to offer?
Who's paying you?
Yeah.
Do the police want to arrest me?
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Pretty good.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Who told you about this?
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
But I...
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Hold it, mister.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I'm worried about Jake.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You can fuck off, too.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
No.
Eh, Poli Sci?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Oh, I don't have one.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Check.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Eh, no.
Eh, no.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
My door is always open.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
But we can't just dig it up!
Why not?
Oh, my. We're too late.
Is he all right?
What's that?
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
What was that?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Maude, I must speak to you.
How about some candy floss?
Do you think there is any life up there?
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Mother.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Yes. It does.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Your studies?
Yes.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Well, I don't...
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Harold!
Stay where you are, Harold .
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
We've always been here.
Julia.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
What's the matter with her?
What?
No bad dreams.
Steve...
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
hound of resurrection --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Me?? C'mon --
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
No. Don't --
Yup.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
Goodnight, then.
That your daughter?
We want the man who did this --
We've got such sights to show you --
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
I don't remember.
Julia!
You remember.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Well can I come in or not?
Help me.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Let me see.
Where's Daddy?
It's ONE of these.
So what's the argument?
Well?
How are you doing through there?
Are you all right?
Can I get you anything?
Please...
I don't know where to begin...
Plain soda?
No personal details?
Who's there?
No Dad.
Kirsty.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
He's gone.
Get the fuck out of here.
Need any help?
Oh!
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Steve. Thank God you came.
You gotta be kidding me.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Say it.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
What did he ever do to you?
Yeah.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Isn't it?
None.  Christ!
You're not even coming?
What's up?
What the fuck is that?
No.  We need the gig.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Well what about the new Echo --
I have a television.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
May I help you?
Right.  Why?
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
What's his name?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
What is this.
It's Vince and Justin.
What needs sorting out?
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Yeah.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
Hi.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
I don't know.
Is it better?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Mmm hmm.
Don't forget your CDs.
Those aren't mine.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Hi.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Look, we can do other things.
What about Ian?
C'mon.  I want to know.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
Harder.
I'm alright.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
No.  Probably not.
You called this morning?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
Are you okay?
I'm sure it isn't.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
Sure.  Ten cents.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
-Okay okay.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Yes.
Basil the II.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
I don't know what you're talking about.
He tried to kill me last night.
Not your concern.
No.
You are being foolish.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No one knows you're here?
What's all that?
When you finish, what then?
It's beautiful.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
A factor of age.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Thanks.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
What were you doing in Felton?
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
I don't believe him.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Aye.
I was driven out.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
You're a long way from Inverness.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
It is less.
What?
It is the truth.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Me arm hurts.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
I am not ready for this.
I have no future husband.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Tradition.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Spare a chair?
You've been here from the start.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
No. Roy. Roy V.
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Did you give her the money?
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
How's business, Bruce?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
No, you don't!
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
No!
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
What for?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Now you're talking!
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Huh!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Hello -- hello...
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Murder, uh?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
In a way.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Then why are you doing it?
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
How much?
Let's see the money.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
What went off?
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Just one second --
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
I did.  Hold the wire.
No -- don't out me off.
We'll fix that, too. 
What?
A sight for sore eyes!
And so do I!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Five hundred dollars.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
You mean here in the city?
For heaven's sake, why not?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Pinkus.
Here's the picture of my wife.
What's he want?
But Grandpa, you said...
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
I never was.
Won't they have maps?
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
I did see them. I did.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
What's that?
A bit too quick.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
What is it?
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
No Turks.
He always knows.
The ideas you get in your head.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Molly!
Really, that's a long time.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
Which way?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Thank you.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
What?
What the hell are you laughing about?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Keep straight on this road here.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
There's not enough room.
Quiet.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Open up the trunk.
Oh, right.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
No, just a little too old.
Where is he?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
What about the body you found?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Say my name.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Hmmmph.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
That's what I'm counting on.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
No. I married a midget.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
It looks wonderful.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Shaving cream?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Who from work?
You are an animal.
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Good. Making progress.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Oh boy!
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Ugnh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Yes.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
And a fact is a fact.
How much do I owe you?
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
I'm buyin'.
I got drunk.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
For who?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
When do I raise the bet?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
I can beat him.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Please don't get off me now.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
What kind of straight pool game you like?
He's my partner.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
How do you feel?
Fast and loose, man.
How much we got?
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
HOW MUCH?!
Aw, Eddie.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
What's the limit?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You better not miss, friend.
Long wait for a bus?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
Okay. So what's your name today?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Is that what makes a winner?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
He went off someplace.
Go on back to the hotel.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Yes.
Why don't you start with me?
I only protect myself -- !
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Hell of a night.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
What did it look like?
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
No.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Why, yes.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Not really...
Dad, don't start.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You try Martin?
It's perfect the line is busy?
You punched the President in the face?
I'm making a mess.
Oh shit, we're late.
What're you doing?
We're loose!
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Any news on my wife?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
How're we doing?
Grey, you read me?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It had been deemed classified.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
You're late.
You know me...
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
But I gave you some this morning.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
We should leave too.
How' he doing?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
And before here?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
All your life.
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tapestries?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Yes?
I usually don't.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
This.
The Grail Diary.
No. You like the way I do things.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
All I have to do is squeeze.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
It is you Junior!
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Rats?
You did!!
Umh?
My lucky charm.
Brody's this way.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Dad, how can you?
Those people are trying to kill us!
Dad?
Uh-huh.
After you, Junior.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What's that?
I ride with you, Indy?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Come one, what's wrong?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Long ago -- before my father's father.
What do you mean -- how?
What'd he say now?
It's pulling me deeper!
What's happening?
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Don't catch cold.
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
What're we going to do?!
You're in my head...
Yes.
My place, can't you see?
Who am I?
I told you, my name is Al.
I'll tell you what to say.
What do you mean we.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Find You?
Sue them.
We have to get out of here.
Now what.
That's not a good idea.
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
Why not?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
The sand.
Why not?
It's sand.
Help me out, will you?
What?
Where are you going?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Rene...
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
On what?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
It's him.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
Gimme a minute.
Keep thinking.
Rene?
Doesn't matter.
I'm against it.
What kind of a deal?
It's a long story.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
Al Viola.
...Foreign service.
It may have been affected.
How do I look?
Well what?
Here?
What?
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
...Blake
Blake?
Dinner...tonight.
Do what?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Disinterest?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
And how'm I doing?
You seemed interesting.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Who did?
I'm just on vacation.
Oh sure.
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Where what?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Why not?
They asked about you.
Now what?
I knew it. I told him.
It wasn't me. It was him.
He told me what to do.
That's twenty feet high.
It is?
Yes.
What's new?
I'll take some.
Instant rice...?
I heard them.
Yes, baby?
We gotta hook up.
P.J.'s.
Monday.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm afraid you are.
What caliber is your gun?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
I can take her.
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
What's the difference...
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
I'm alone on this...
Alright?
Yeah, I'm here.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
What do you mean?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
I disappeared on you?
Oh, lots.
Oh, please, Mike...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Yeah... Thank you.
How do you like your coffee? Black?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Next to your father?
You believe that?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
What about now?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
You're gonna get your fix...
It acts as a...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
He --
Baby. You are so HOT!
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Who's the pigeon?
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
You want Botox?
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
No.
You're vulnerable.
Is Tong older than Ming?
I assume this is on Rex?
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
She didn't love you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Hi.
Miles? You're scaring me.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
You can't prove anything.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
Hello?
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Is this a lover?
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
She did a Harriman.
Who's she?
Every week --
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Video.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
What's Kirshner?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Yes, I know—but—
You ought to know why. Because—
South America.
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
Oh, yes. I heard.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
What happened?
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
What do you think you're doing!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
What am I going to do now?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Your ego is colossal.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Nope. No complaints.
No. No. It's too good a story.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Thanks, professor.
You weren't so bad yourself.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
What's got into you?
I don't want it now.
But what!
was so scared—that it scared—
Carrots.
Raw?
Here comes a car!
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What for?
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
I love you.
You bet I did.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
You bet we did.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Any of your passengers want a place to sleep—there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
You!
Yeah.
Mush. Mush.
Who?
Not a minute!
What's the idea?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Huh?
Why—no—
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Did he pay?
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
You know you keep saying that.
Keep saying what?
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Why?
No, I did not.
What did they...
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
What do you mean?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Then who killed the President?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
My sympathies.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
For sexual purposes?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
What are you driving at, boss?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Goddamn Sam!
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
And he never hit you before?
You have other information?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
What are they?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
But then you told her you were home.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Who?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
What'd ya mean?
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
That doesn't sound dark.
Was she helpful?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
My ass ain't the same.
How was it?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
I see.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
You're rationalizing.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
I hesitated taking that much.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
Spain.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Most of the times.
Oh, Miss Brown?
You know what we want.
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
No.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
I'm recording this.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What's her story?
She told you that?
Was she there?
Uh-huh.
Yes. All those things are true.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
How long you been with Ordell?
It looks good on you.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
Got some o.j.?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
I got a problem...
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
You told them that?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
I don't know. One of your friends.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Uh-huh.
Drink?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
What for?
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
It's a diet thing?
Yeah.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
C'mon, don't lie.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
Then what?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Guess where I am?
You're outside?
Uh-huh.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Uh-huh.
Pretty sure.
You said five hundred and fifty!
What?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
I'm going out for a few hours.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Beaumont Livingston.
You don't say.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
House or apartment?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
It still sounds high.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
She got off, huh?
I thought you might be asleep.
All I did was walk out with it.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
She's been there since Thursday night.
Have her bring the money here.
Turn left.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Who is it?
We're back.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I'm okay.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
You have an unusual hand.
Short? It's ended.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
What did she have to say?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I haven't seen her in months.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Whataya mean, no record?
She was good in bed, though.
Go to sleep.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
That help?
I don't know.
The best.
What do you mean you can see?
Is that the one who died?
Wait. Don't.
Jake!
What's wrong?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
We're at Della's.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
He's coming right over.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
While you were in the shower.
Why didn't you call me?
Let go!
Who was that?
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
I don't know you.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
I'm not upset.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
West.
Where are they?
Sit down!
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
Well that's good to know.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
I don't know what to say.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
I no from around here.
He's burning up.
I'll page him.
Lennox Hospital.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Can I help you?
Do you want me to get someone?
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
Duck fuckers?
We're not leaving Crutch!
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Can't shut em' down from here.
Okay that hurt.
Nice touch.
Kay-Em!
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
It bought us some time.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Give me a break! What happened?
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Rizzo, pull away!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Kaboom.
You lost the charge?
Now that's just gross.
I'm missing two!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
This is what it means right here.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What do we do?!!
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Kicker!
I don't understand...what does he want?
What?
The power's back up!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
I'm sending you the files.
Nanotechnology.
Guys, please come with me!
Just a favor for your old man.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Michael! Come inside!
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
I hope we get some more help.
What day is this?
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
I didn't know her.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
This is Quint, Missus.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Anti-Shark cage.
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
He's heading under -- !
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Whose idea was it?
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
I still have your virginity!
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
I don't really know anything about it.
What are you talking about?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Oh, God...
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Cool it.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
What do you play?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Commercials.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
You know... it's parts...
We definitely want it to have junk.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Hey, I like this.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Cool.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
I heard that was you.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Juno? What's going on?
Hi Dad.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You mean like couples?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Unfortunately, yes.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Touche.
Hly shht!
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
So. What's that thing?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
What did you do?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
We're actually, finally doing this?
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
...I said, I like your hair.
What's Early been in jail for?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
...thank you.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Can't hurt.
How much do I owe you?
That bad?
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Fuck!
Why, what did he do?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Shit.
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
Yeah.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Yep.
You down with the boost?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Good luck?
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Casper, where is he?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Right now?
Come on.
I'm nervous.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
No...
Because, you know why. You know.
Do you care about me?
Dance!
Telly is at Steven's?
You're OK?
Sorry.
No.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Telly says was up.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
Mine?
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I'm coming.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Making love is like.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah I get bored.
What?!
Mom.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
I can't man.
What do you mean, no?
What?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
Sorry.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
What is it?
Hello, Peter.
To get your attention.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Why not?
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Very good.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
It's me you want.  Not her.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
I know where you are.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Is your dad here?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
As large as castles.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Feel like practicing?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
How come you don't stay with them?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Sounds very violent.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
Do you?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Relax.
No.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It was.
What is this?
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
What do you want on it?
What's wrong?
You're right.  The killer told me.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
That's worse.
We're almost married.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Take the western passage.
Turold's son was to marry her.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
I can't reach her.
I'm not sure.
Can she be forced?
The Beast will kill her.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Let me comfort you.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Would you settle for a boar?
Quell?
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will come for me.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
She has the power to kill.
Look.
Kegan!
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
Where is he? My son.
Why must you know?
It will not help.
What's that man's name?
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
...What?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Yeah.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Huh... 500 meters?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
How many girlfriends did you have?
...I got lost, Mister.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
...Composer.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Do you recognize him?
This smells good.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
Are you two planning kids?
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
Mine.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
I know what you're getting at.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Okay.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
You thought I sent them?
The new store?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
Why there?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
I thought you were asleep.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Nine.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
It has to be a full character's name.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Why know?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Come on Mr. Parker.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Hello!
Hello.
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
You're pretty drunk.
Do you want to fuck now?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
You OK?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
OK.
How are you doing?
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Will you lighten up, please?
You know I love you... yeah?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Where have you been staying?
Yes? What?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
But it's a top three school --
What alibi?
I loved him!
Were you with another man?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
Did you hear a shot fired?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Did you get it?
What did you see when you entered the house?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
I'm so happy for you!
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
I know. He has it sent out.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
She's completely untrustworthy.
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
How do you figure?
She's not!
So?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Are you asking me on a date?
Amazing how?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Class schedule, map, book list.
Your what?
Of course.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
You got into Harvard Law?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Where?
Three months.
She's naked.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
What?
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
And, now?
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
It's terrible.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
I fear she's lost.
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
Don't you care about what's happened?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Will you lead me to her?
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Will you chance a miss?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
He'll not escape me.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
We seek to undo the curse.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
How much longer?
Are you honest?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
What have I done?
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
What's the matter?
Everywhere!  Ow!
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
You'll visit again?
This is not the time for squabbling.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
In every way.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
And sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
You... you... you mortal you!
Be fair, Oona.
Heading north still?
Hello, Jack.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Can you show us the way?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
What are you doing?
I wanna be with you today.
Do you guys feel like painting?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
He must.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
You look better without make-up.
Yeah.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
You hate your father.
He's at work while I'm here.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
I've been here twenty years.
I hate this job.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
I'm sorry.
You're here early today.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
I'll ask.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
No.
It bugs me.
I took some of your Vicodin.
What are you now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Are you talking?
Sun glasses?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
I would have killed him.
I loved him too much.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I still don't know what that means.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Ah!  Oh....
God, you look like crap, George.
She needs to be alone, I think.
A blueprint spool.
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days.  I left to think.
Money?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
It makes me sad.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
With your hands or your tongue?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
You brought your kids?
Do you need help?
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
What did I say?
That was the truth.
You've never said that before.
Don't even...I'm there.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Do it now!
Do you know anything about building a house?
What are you doing in my room?
You're sure about this?
All day again?
I brought a few of my own.
Nagger?
He's a big one.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Not for me, it ain't.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Nothing.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
The hell you talking about? What train?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
Well, if that's the way it is...
That was five years ago.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Go where, Ray?
Back to New York for starters.
Don't make me take them away from you.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
How about some steak sauce?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
All in, boss!
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
What do you think about that?
What are you doing here, mama?
Is everyone here?
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Are you offering me a bribe?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
What's your name?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
ADRIAN!
He's sick?
Now will you get in the flask?
That's what I thought!
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
No!
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
An angel?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
What can I do about it?
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
No. This can't be happening.
Bus?
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
By she, do you mean he?
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
This don't look good.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
So I followed him...
Please. You got to.
Good idea... kill me.
The South.
"Octopus people?"
It's freezing my hands.
What were you thinking coming here?
Do me.
It looks like the work of a brother...
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Had enough?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
I'm fine...  See you...
I'm Mary 2.
What's wrong, Available?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
Sad? What made you sad?
Jessica.
No.
And now?
About what?
Not about that.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Where did you get that?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
They won't believe us.
Beloved husband...
What kind of jewel is this?
What belongs to the people?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
What kind of place is this?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Well? How do you like it?
Good... You up for a drive?
Pete... You okay?
Very strange.
I can't see you tonight.
In pornos?
You liked it.
Andy?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Sit down a minute.
His physical condition.
No.
You talk to him?
Repeat that, Bill.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
Something wrong?
We've met before, haven't we?
That's why I married you.
We've got to call the police.
Was there?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Give that a try.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Yeah.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Whatiya mean?
No... I told you.
Where'd you come from?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
All of it?
Found in Asia!
Sorry.
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
I'm thinking.
Just call me Barney.
There you are!
Well, that's that, I guess.
Chalmers Bryant!
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Oh, yes.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Very often.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
Yes, charming.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
No porters here!!
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Are you the High Lama?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Bob! I think I hear motors!
Yes.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
You?
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
That's what you said.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
I'd go mad!
Why not?
You say the porters are waiting for us?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
You see, it's not a dream.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
I'd love it!
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
You shot an eight year old girl.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Sir--
Sir, you can't just--
What?
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Now what?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Something's wrong here.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
And what's this ... ?
He's here to help!?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
They're not my pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Which way?
How's Dee?
Please --
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Why?
Just some guy... they found.
John?  What is it?
That's comforting.
It's all I could safely move.
I put you away --
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
... Graveyard shift.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Uh, sir...
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Everybody runs.
Red Ball?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Yes.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
She was looking right at me.
She spoke to me.
So?
You gotta have faith, Dad.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
You're not gonna kill me?
The what?
And how did Lamar become involved?
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Not if I stay away from him.
What?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
The system would collapse.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Hold that thought.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Sean --
Sir, the press conference is starting.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
What?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I wanna kill my boss.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
What about your meeting?
This your work?
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
I don't have any sugar either.
Since right after we lost our son.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Are you sure?
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
He's okay.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
5-5-1.
You driving her?
So what do we do?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
What?
Yeah. Sorry.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Yeah.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I'll page you.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
We need guns.
Bullshit...
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
It's not even yours.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Is that the woman from..?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
You happy?
Where do you think you're going?
What the fuck was that about?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
All the more reason.
Eighty bucks?!?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Dude, we were practically made...
No. I'll wait here.
Yeah. I want it.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Don't drag my ass into this --
See you later.
Ow, shit...
Come, now. You just got here.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
What about my keys?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
No...
So, we're talking money laundering...
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Keeps me out of the army.
Man's rep travels.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Daddy, where's my money?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I'm wearing, Archie.
Let Billie finish.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Elijah who?
What do you do with your time?
Where am I gonna start?
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
The body is a holy repository.
What can I do for you?
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
I can handle it.
Just an idle question.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
I'm tired of praying.
Brother Earl.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Just what are you saying?
What?
And like a fool I believe it.
She know?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
I better not come in.
I know where you're going.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
500.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Let me die then.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
You want to be the head man?
That's right.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[Why?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
Where do I find you?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Who killed her? You?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[The ransom was ten.]
Yes.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
So how's business?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Creasy?
Time will tell.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Well, I let him go.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
I dropped her at home.
Then be trained.
Rosanna Guerrero.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
She's young. She'll get over it.
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
Two tourists who never went home.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Which one was that?
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
You told me.
It pains that they should do this.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
Yes, I know.
Wadda you think?
Marty...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
You not ugly.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Miss you, Walt.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
And there it is.
I think I heard about that.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
C-A-M-E-M...?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
Black capsule.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
No, no, that one.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
How did you get called that?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
The one and only.
He's coming to.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
There's only one worth noticing.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
Yes, that's what I mean.
Yes, sir?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Oh, get out of here!
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Nice.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Uh-huh . . .
Can I help you pack?
Do you care if I sit down out here?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Thirty dollars.
A hundred dollars!
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Hello?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Hurry up, Pop.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Well, maybe you're right.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Yeah, a little.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Ba-ll!
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Well?
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
That's too bad.
Shh!
They're not usually graduate students.
No -- you can't do that.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Apartment 306.
What happened? Is there a problem?
Tell me what's wrong.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
Only at the very end.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
What's the point of this?
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
You don't like New York?
How did you like Toronto?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
I think I can handle that one.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
Yes.
That's okay. That's his style.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
There's your answer. He's smart.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
So what do you want to do?
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's okay. We broke up.
How's Paco doing?
There is?
Stay here, don't move.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Hmm?
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
You crazy? With all those people around?
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
What do you need?
True.
Why?
She said I have a son...
Why --
Do you believe in miracles?
What's happening?
The new world.
You were the one who was dying.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Unfinished business.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
What about the customers with reservations?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Two maze runners.
Won't be time if he gets access --
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Then you had her killed.
-- The inside?
Realize?
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
There?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
That's pretty bad.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
I see... a fox
PTERODACTYL!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
All systems go!
Two thirty three a.m.
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
How'd you know?
THREE SECONDS!!
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
But I've never served a day.
The goddamned bastards.
Whatever you say, Boss.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He was around...
How's Bugsy doin'?
Who hired the bastard?
Inside, they were talking of you.
For being a bootlegger?
I needed to see you again.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Charlie!
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Masseria's been after me too.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Spare us.
Luciano is dead?
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Anything ain't a very hard number.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
<u>Why</u>??
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Death! Thank you!
At the moment, yes.
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
I don't think so.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
Uh-huh?
Mother!
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Let's send out a pigeon!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Huh?
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Waiter!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Otis!
Are you ready for him, Bill?
How do you feel, champ?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Henry Hill.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Y-yes, Jim.
Aw--
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
A dirty frame!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Will the Senator yield for a question?
I yield.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Yes, I was--
Y-yes.
Ah, now, that's better.
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Jefferson--
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
Is--is something the matter?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Go ahead--punch.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
We're over in the House.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Lena.
No! Stop it!
In Terry Canyon?
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Hello.
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Sure.
That's--that's splendid.
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
His first 'whiff'!
Father--oh.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Senator Paine will state it!
Who's that?
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Yes, but I—
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
That depends on what they see.
Now, what do you see?
There's Times Square.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Uh-huh.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
What're you going to do?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
How is this, sir?
Nuisance value?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
He's what?
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
You're going to New York with us.
Huh?
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Me?!
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
Yes, sir.
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Uh-huh.
What is your name?
South Dakota north.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Yes, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
Looking for?
Me, sir?
How did they threaten you?
Really? You think so?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
Thank you.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
What are you doing for lunch?
Interesting approach. What was his name?
What's that?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Mr. Follett.
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Where's your wife, Henry?
I was... never satisfied.
What's that?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
I've had my moments.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
A little.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I'm sorry, your honor.
You do?
What do you want to know?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
But you know how to drive?
Don't need it.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Why don't you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
No.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Where?
It doesn't matter. Go on.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And he's where?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Hello.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Was it something that happened at school?
No again?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Uh-huh.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
How's it coming?
You don't think I'm insane?
Really?
"Get to know your therapist."
And the drugs?
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
When?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Altar boys?
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
What just happened?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
What is he doing here?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
Where are they taking him?
No?
Yeah, I was there.
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
No... Why?... Should I?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
I'm staying.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Jonathan?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
You lied to me!
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
I found it, Evy! I found it
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
So who killed him?
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
He's dead.
Snap out of it!
Should I kill them?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Stay away!
Or talk?
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
What are you talking about?
This place is built like a fortress.
Are you coming or not?
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
So why don't you just tell her!
Let's go.
Maybe there was traffic.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
The Obliterators!
So what can I get you?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
She likes you.
The who?
Oh no.
Where am I going?
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
I'm glad you like it.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
You realize what is at stake?
And where is the army?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
And where is Joseph?
That is incredible.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Yes, sir.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
No, sir.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
And now?
Promise me.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Promises mean nothing.
Yes -- what is it?
Open the door.  It's me.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
What are you doing in there?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
There's probably some explanation.
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
That is a matter of opinion.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Yes, sir.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Alright, I'll remember that.
What you mean talk to her?
You know what he mean, dude.
This you?
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Hello, remember me?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
Delivery!
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
He's inside the house?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Call me.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
What?
I'll take you later.
Hey, what's going on?
Take your car.
My back.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Huh?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
Can we go now?
Could I see some identification, sir?
Are you 'fucking with me!?
The gun...
What about the gun?
I killed you.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I don't know.
I think you better put that away.
You remember me?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Yeah, all right, listen...
What am I supposed to say to her?
Thanks for the shine.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
Put her on.
Any trouble?
No, Ben.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Here they come.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Who?
Bluebeard!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
Satan.
Amen.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Why?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
I'm hungry, John.
John, where's your folks?
Can I have milk too?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
No, Harry! I thought --
Do you want more children, Willa?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Because he was scary, that's why.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
My dream.
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Hello Nancy.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Sure, but...
Who? Who did that?
Where you think you're going?
Get into bed.
What?
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
You okay?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
He's nuts about you.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
No more fights?
Well, here are fifty francs.
You should be more careful, Anna.
I see.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Capitalistic methods...
Monsieur.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Yes, Comrade?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
No, sir.
Your Highness...
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Is this satisfactory?
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
What proposition?
Comrade Kopalski...
A cow?
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Yes, monsieur?
That's even better.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
I will start with you.
You repeat yourself.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Will you smile?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Do you like Scotch stories?
Did you make any change in this room?
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
A funny story?
But, darling, you can't do that.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
Would that make you any happier?
...but big.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Hello, Leon!
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
You can't imagine.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Yes.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
What is this, Swana?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
That's all right... I grow on people.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Unfortunately.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
May I ask what has happened?
I don't understand.
We could check the tape again, sir.
How's the job coming, Bob?
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
No, we have nothing to hide.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Pay him.
No, you didn't, Bob.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
There's no secrets here, Al.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
I don't know anything about that.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
How is this national security?
Where are they?
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
What ... ?
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Who do you think is behind it?
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
There's no other choice.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Jesus Christ!
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Syracuse.
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
So I'm supposed to be ...
We lost ...
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Anything.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Yes!
Congratulations, Dick.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Who else'd be in your truck.
'Predate it.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No money in his room there?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
The old boy shot by the highway?
What about yours?
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Okay.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I ain't got the money.
To your husband.
Llewelyn.
Goin' out.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
You can't afford one?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
I know where the money is.
Yessir?
...Where's the transponder?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
All right.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Is somethin' wrong?
Sir?
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Everything.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
Good. I need everything else.
Okay.
What room?
...Keep going. Don't stop.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
Yessir.
Waitin' for my wife.
What else then?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Not any way.
What did you do?
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
No sir.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Yeah?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
A woman can write a check.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
You're lying!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
We think we know where Betty is.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
Who are these idiots?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Umm, I don't think that...
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
Of course.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
...like the water purifiers?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I'd slap his face.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
I left my husband two days ago.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
What are you doing?
So why'd you come to L.A.?
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You should have a little faith in people.
Where are you going?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Huh?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
You told me how to do it!
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
We can live with that.
What the hell was that, another statement?
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Like... us?
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Where? Where is she?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
Can I have an evil twin?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
David Ravell.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Waitaminute -
You can't do this -
- and share one of your graves.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Okay, Everett.
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Uh-huh.
I counted to three, honey.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
It was a moment a weakness!
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
But...
Pete... I do apologize.
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
I am. Hur you?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
I been calling for four months.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Okay, okay. You win.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Who's that?
I never said any of that!
Zack, we've got to go.
What's your name, boy?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Pity you don't have the character.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Hi, son.
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
And you turned him down??
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Do you go to school?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
You stayed after all.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Twenty-two years ago.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Why?
That's brilliant.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
She's gonna handle it.
Get the fuck away from me.
They're not supposed to be here!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
They won't get hurt.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Be quiet.
They're gonna die in there!
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Can we come in?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Push that button for me, will you?
What?
Ever read any Poe?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Got us in here, didn't I?
The crowd goes wild.
What do they want?
Yeah.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Fuck.
Oh, please.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
He --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tell you...
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
What the fuck?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Get out of the car.
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
Rodgers... this is no good...
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Yes sir I was.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
You mean...
That's right brother... listen and learn.
C'mon let's...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Wait a second there brother...
You were. infantry right?
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
I don't know about that.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
What's the pig's name?
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
If you got something to say, say it.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Why didn't you tell me?
Rose?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Well?
You got salt last week.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Excuse me?
Goodbye, Charlotte.
What unit?
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
Did your father teach you humility?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
No...
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
Cheraw Falls.
Don't go in there.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I don't care.  I hate him.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
Thirteen years...
You were an Englishman then...
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Not held, just slowed down.
Thank you.
How many came back?
Well...I guess not.
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Because you promised.
You believe in it.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What were you listening to?
You folks ready to go on?
No need to apologize.
Does she love the cat?
I'm not climbing that.
Almost there, Louis.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
But--
What did we do, Jud?
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
And Buckaroo Banzai.
The movers--
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Thank you, Louis.
That boat is my livelihood!
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
Why don't I want to do this?
Do you believe him?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Commodore, you can't do that!
You're speaking up for him again?
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
You're in league with Barbossa!
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Exactly.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
How did you get off the island?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Where does it make berth?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
'Bootstrap?'
I swear, you look just like him.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Shut up, before you lose them all!
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
Depends.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Then you still love me?
Considering what?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
Of course, sir.
I don't believe this is happening...
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Mouse?  What mouse?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
What do these replicators do to people?
Look at this!
What's that supposed to mean?
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
Susie... I...
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Indeed? How interesting.
Certainly. Right over there.
What do you want?
Where did you get those letters?
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
That's ridiculous.
You're acting like a child.
Mother!
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Oh, is that so?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
I bring a message from Garcia.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Yeah?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Gloria Golden?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Come on, get going, get going!
It has been alleged - yes—
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
No?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Thank you, sir.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
Well!
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Did who?
What do you know about Conrad?
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
No.
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
I don't eat waffles.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Okay - you remember Joe—
Sure.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Are the cars ready?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
I just putter.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
What is that?
I told you where I was.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Where are you gonna go?
Really Biff? The keenest?
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
... Lover's Lane.
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
"Changes."
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Thank you very much.
No. Of course not.
Did you do this?
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
What color is that hedge of yours?
What are you doing?
I still don't see why we're doing this.
We're supposed to be in school.
You know him?
Can we do any better?
So what is it?
Sure.
Yeah ...
How come I'm still in black and white?
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
And you're sure about this?
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?
How?
Yeah.
What's going on?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Yeah ...
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Because we don't belong!
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Where's the remote control I gave you?
No you're not.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Really?
Yeah.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
...yes I'm still on hold...
Why?
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
You look nervous.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
What?
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Where are you?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
It doesn't matter.
You have a girlfriend?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
You're going to work now?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
So you think you can?
....what....?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
Are you telling me no?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Do you have brothers or sisters?
What do you do with all this pudding?
Yeah.
Yeah?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
What?
Hi.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Have a good trip.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
I'm fine are you ok?
It's a plastic, yeah.
Yeah.
Why? ...what?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Can I ask how much is this?
It's ok, take your time.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
I didn't know you had a sister?
It's alright.
Like a psychiatrist?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Good morning, Barry....
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
So what should I do with the pudding?
What happened?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Where you been?
What?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Please don't do this.
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
What are you doing?
Seven o'clock.
I know.
Ok.
That's cool.
What's the problem?
What did you say?
Nothing.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Are you sure?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
By whom? The Marquis?
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
They can't be serious.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
You mean to take us all down with you?
What the devil --
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
Quite.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
Oh, but I am!
This is neither the time nor the place --
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Ever met Walter Winchell?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
That poor woman.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Sure you can, just--
Do you?
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Oh, why is that?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
There's a different between want and
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Keep filming.
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Huh?
We're using-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
What are movies about, Orson?
Like a bug.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Please don't say this.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
I expected more from you.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Don't do this
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
It's 350 pages long.
What?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Yes.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
You're going to destroy it
Yes
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
Jesus
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
It was fun, wasn't it?
Oh, no--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
You're a good sport, lady.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Sure. What is it?
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You wasn't with her, were you?
Huh?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
C'mon, Joey.
When?
What?
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
Does that mean...
Three more, I figure.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Should I hit it?
Can you see it?
No.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
What?
Yeah.
All I did...
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
Why don't you just call him up?
No, not that.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
But they don't have a case against you.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
How's the weight? Ok?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
But his leg!
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Well, officer -- do your duty.
For instance?
Thanks.
-- until yesterday morning.
Who said they left then?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
Jeff -- huh?
Ever get an answer?
Jewelry?
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
She expects me to marry her.
That's normal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Isn't he a salesman?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Would four of them -- ?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Empty as a football.
Anything else bothering you?
Something big going on somewhere?
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Lisa, please!
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
I wonder where he's going now?
It doesn't make sense to me.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That's what the witnesses told him.
From his landlord -- once a month.
I do?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Steady Marlon!
I'm glad they let you out.
Jim Stark.
Sure.  It's fine.
No--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Mother--
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
What would you do, Dad?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
See?  It stopped.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
It's me!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
What?
Isn't he schizoid?
I'm here.
Who's that?
I shot at one of them.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Leave me alone.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Now that's true!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
No.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I felt like it.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Ever been in a place like this before?
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
No!
Yes.  My best friend.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
You weren't looking for company, were you?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
What?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Must have a way with stationery.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
I've been doing good, though.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Yes it was all you --
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Well, I don't know about that --
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
He working for them on this one?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Get your own room, Ashley.
That guy knows you?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You said it a million times!
Put him in the truck.
I shared his cell!
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
Be more specific.
What's her greatest fear?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
We walked the place for a week.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Might as well be.
Do I get a country-western name?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
No way.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Hell you haven't.
Ain't there yet.
Not yet.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
I'm just saying.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Jesus, Rudy --
YOU TELL HER!
...for Christmas...
Do what?
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
But... I had a five...
Start talkin
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
...What bar?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
How can you tell?
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
What's this?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Wong?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
That's your proof?
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
So, talk.
What're you talkin' about?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
You didn't ask.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
What happened?
Dead.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
I don't know anybody.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
And this is Helen Carter.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
What's the matter with her?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
He's learning his letters.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Will she be dark or fair?
All right -- it's said!
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Who's Lednov?
What was he in jail for?
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
Kind of sore.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
What is it?
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Good night, Miss Wells.
That's the end of the line.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
I think he wants me.
No, I won't let you do it.
Alex, what are you doing?
My favorite memory was when we --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
No, stay.
Hi Buddy.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Then what are we going to do?
So, whatever happened to her?
It's the sequel.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Father!
I'm sorry.
You could use the grade, huh?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I take it you're not mad at me.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Professor, I think you should see this.
Professor, we need to talk.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
BLOOD FEAST!
Mother? 
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
No comment!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
In here, Mom...
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
No woman would!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
That's like your car, Beverly,
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
You forgot something...
You can?
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
I'd like to get out of here.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
"The Dante?"
But I like teaching school.
I ought to know.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Why?
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
I'd like that.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Oh, I'm making investigations.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Could you find him?
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
You'll be all right?
I have been at the library.
But you're always at the library.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
What's wrong, Mary?
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Uh—huh.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
Perhaps.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
You know where she is?
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Unless what?
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
She's not been here for a long time.
That makes it all the more difficult ——
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Videotapes.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Why not?
That's a good question.
What will you do when the money runs out?
No.
Can't.
Yes.
How come?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
I can't.
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Who? Elizabeth?
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Don't do that.
Come on!!
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Always the lawyer.
You've made your point.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Yes.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Why, so you can go after him?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I have a pretty good idea.
Lose something?
Fine.
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
There's a phone here.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
The extrovert.
You want me to leave?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Nope.
She didn't give you my address?
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Yes.
Whichever you prefer.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
What did he say?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I've got to get back to the office.
You know what I mean.
Hello.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
Why not?
I just... Ann is very...
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
Answer him, goddammit!!
IBM.
Brian Kirkland, please.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
That you, Rog?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
No? How come?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
I'm not going, Janet.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
Mental instability?
I'd forgotten.
Could I do that later?
It's...
You shouldn't have said that.
You're practically naked!
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Brad!
F for...
THAT MINIMAL
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Highliner, please.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
And Lexapro, yes.
This is rose, right?
Huh.
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Yeah. Tight.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
And she likes Pinot.
She works for tips!
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
What?
What?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Nope.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
What's that supposed to mean?
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
She tell you she was married?
The plan is... you go.
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
Look at this!
You broke some.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Twelve months in oak.
She got anything good?
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Um... yeah but it's more...
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yeah? Like what?
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Maya.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Where are you?
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
I am.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
What's the matter?
Only for pee or poop.
What are you thinking about?
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
...I will.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
This is going to do nothing.
Merrill --
They're broadcasting...
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
Dad.
What's two?
It's like War of the Worlds.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
You'll never make it.
Kate?
Paden sends his best.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
You must have known that before you came.
Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I understand.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Because they don't like what I want.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Who did it?
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why come to me?
What about his brother?
So we understand each other?
I'm going to have to look into this.
I've got a place I can hide her.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
You're not renewing my contract.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
"Forever".
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Viktor, you should have said something.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Really?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
What I do to Simone?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
No, I'm okay.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
You do?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Your mother couldn't make it?
Okay, Dad.
Good-night, Daddy.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Is it a jamming device?
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
Long live the First Amendment.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Hi.
Wow. They called you their son.
Why, Malcolm?
Why did you leave me?
What were they hiding from?
No.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
What?
Dr. Crowe?
You really look better.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
No.
Communicate?
Dead people.
Dead people?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Someone actually... employs you?
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
"With a hack-hack here --"
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
You'll be back.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Never heard of it.
He started it.
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Someone better tell Mac.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
That's not funny.
Whatcha' doin'?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
You took Bill.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
I can't hear when you're nodding.
I got to leave my post.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
It's just a work thing.
Where are you going?
Okay.
I'll get if for you.
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Praise Jesus.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
Having fun.
You have a great profile.
What the hell's going on?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
You know this guy, don't you?
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Yeah?
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
He's just exhausted.
Why should I?
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
How long's this gonna take?
Six. Got it.
Why are we doing this?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
What's your twenty?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What's your twenty?
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Damn... alright then.
Man, that's great.
What'd you say?
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
Where's Israel?
My debrief --
You're finished.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
I wouldn't go that far.
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- okay, g'head --
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
A million flat.
Yeah... Sid?
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
You love her?
Like a mafucka.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
What else did Padiche say?
What's the time frame?
Can it work?
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Yes.
No, she won't.
Why would you let her to do that?
Is there anybody else here?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What plan?
Just get him to stop.
When did this happen?
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Book?
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What happened to us, exactly?
I like that too.
What's wrong.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Chris --
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
Why do you say that?
Gibarian was under enormous --
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Queens... You know Queens?
Urdu and Hindi.
How did you know?
Could be, I guess.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
Claire?
I can't open it.
Oh that thing in Queens.
How long you going away for?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
... Mike.
Not if you don't want me to.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Tommy...!
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Hey.  The neighbors.
Oh, some shit.
Why?
Why?
Coming to bed?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
I just sat and listened.
What about when she goes out?
At my house...!
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's what?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Cause if you get in a bind--
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Lemme down, bugface!
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I'd never admit that.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
The record--
How is he?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I will finish what I've begun…
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
There's only one pair left.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
How much more do we have to take from him?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
It's on me.
105-353.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Interesting.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Then droppen Sie dead!
Jawohl!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
You did?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Not yet.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
Right.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
How do they know?
Who did?
You taking Dunbar?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
We have no radio.
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
I do not want those cigarettes.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
Really? What do you feel?
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, are you all right?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
We're within range, sir.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Oh
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
No, I didn't know that.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Why don't we beam it up?
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Not exactly.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Indisposed, sir.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
What about Spock?
Understood, my lord.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Until now.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Maybe...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
You're crazy -- !
But the child --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
They won't --
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Inoperative.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Time's up, Admiral...
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Scotty -- what's left?
Uhura. Can't you augment?
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I would not presume to debate you.
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
The ship -- out of danger?
Spock...!
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
How?
Time from my mark...
I can't get power, sir!
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
Shields activated!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
You do this -- for friendship?
Humans make illogical decisions...
Fine. Just fine.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
It'll come back to him.
Bones --
What did you say she was getting?
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Fundoscopic examination --
Find it?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
You play games with me and you're through
Yes, sir.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
I buy that. What about him?
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Just lucky, I guess.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
What's that?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Where are you going?!
In progress, Admiral.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
How do you know this...?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Why not?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Full power, sir.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Hi.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
Why?
Deceive us?
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
What's the rush?
I understand.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Sometimes I do.
Can he breathe under water?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Is it safe to move her?
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
You're not finished here?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
Implants bothering you?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
I don't think they believe us.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Worf to Picard...
Worf, you must hurry...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Scanners are off line!
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
No, sir...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Why was Data assigned?
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Augh?
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Are you saying they won't help us?
You think they're still up there?
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
I believe so.
I have helm control.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Juice?
This must be it.
Always am.
What's still there?
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Their com system must still be down.
Active.
What do you want?
We?
Track their weapons fire.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Someone...?
No!
Specifically of...?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Stand...?
Retire.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
They'll respect him now...
He's a DOCTOR!
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
An accident wasn't good enough...
I hope you're happy.
Just the prototype.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Never been this close.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Close enough to beam down?
Gorkon's own man??
You must have faith.
Faith...?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
I don't want to.
Sir?
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
- could take weeks, sir.
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Can you remember our father?
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Because you are dangerous.
No. Can I move now?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
Remember him?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
We are being hailed.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
No.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
How could I not?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
This isn't real.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
What programs were accessed?
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
To find the head, sir?
Captain!
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
What's this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
And what of the Enterprise?
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Please.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
No -- this is wasting time.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
But surely...
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
For the moment.
Benny, there's nothing there.
Thank you.
Elmo's...
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
I don't like it, George...
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
What's all this for?
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Please.
Please...
Steering wheel...
Gear shift.
Pancakes.
My... husband.
Shit... shit... what shit?
In your pocket, please...
What?
Why are you going here? What is here?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
You want this ticket?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
What?
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
It's bad.
What are you doing?
I do not want to.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
I will go. But not you.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Horses.
But...
What for?
This is yours...
You want the baby to laugh at me.
The yellow one.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Bullshit!
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
To the same woman?
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Bullshit politics.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Naw.  She won't call me.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
About what?
Commissioner Strickland.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Fumitsu.
That would be no.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Is this great fabric or what?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
I'm not going.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
You see Tran?
Alright.  We're going up.
Right.  That explains it.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
Was this him?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
This isn't in our database?
What's the bad news?
You tell me.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Dylan here.
Hi there.
You heard?
A grill pattern.
You... surprised me.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
What are you...?
My God.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Doesn't fit.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
And one other thing.
What's this country coming to?
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
The tattoo?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
That's true.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Start killing people for real?
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
You're putting me in a difficult position.
But why this pattern?
Yeah, of course.
How are we going to find him?
Agent...
Yes, sir.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
What did you do to end up here?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
It's over for you.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Don't do it, Mike.
I like quiche.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
...then ask where you met her...
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Huh?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Are you on the other line?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
You don't call.
So what's the difference?
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
I didn't make it...
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
What are they doing here?
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Mike?
Hello?
S'up Trent?
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas, baby!
They're all skanks.
That's where we make our scene.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
I know she's coming back.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
She was hot.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Michelle went for you, right.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
...a day...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Yeah. You met him once.
She didn't see.
What the fuck..?
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
What a surprise...
Now?
...honestly...
You're money.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
An eye for an eye!
America has been good to me...
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
You take care of Paulie?
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
How bad will it be?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
You take care of your family?
This morning.
What is this nonsense?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
What miracles you do for strangers.
And now, what do you choose to do?
No.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
How do you do.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
What time do they expect us?
Don't you want dinner first?
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
What?
A million times.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
No, I like him.
I don't like you.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I'm never going back!
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Is Freddie here?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
What?
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Tom.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
What about Cortina?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Very.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
What?
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
How would you know that?
What?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
So -- are you travelling under R?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
And tomorrow?
No.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
All kinds of things. Making plans.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Thank you.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
You want to canvass?
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
You must be rich.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.
How long has he been there?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Betsy, come over here a moment.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
That's fine.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
What's your real name?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
But that one night?
Do I look like a narc?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
Why should it be grounded?
Education?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Who?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Sure.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
What's the action around?
Wiz?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Had a close one.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Spit it out.
I'll go.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
You'll stand by me?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Well...
... including me.  Right?  
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
What was that?
Nothing.  
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Yes... yes, I do.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
I'm not refuting anything.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Yes.
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Harry, son.  Harry.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Who... are they?
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
Yes?
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Luke... what time is it?
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
The G-man?
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
What is it?
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
You should watch what you say.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I was decorated.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
Cigarette?
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
I can play the piano?
No, I...
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Oh...
What happened?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
How do you like our little hamlet?
A trifle.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
She already has a daughter.
I see.
Yes.
Is anyone there?
Look.
Mother!
Mitch, let's turn back.
What?
Where does he live?
That's where the Brenners live.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
D'you want me to order one for you?
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
She was selling birds.
I know, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
If they are?
No.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Some of them are.
I didn't break that window!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
You are, aren't you?
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
So you didn't go to school together.
Yes.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
It is for me.
I have several jobs.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
How long have they been gathering there?
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
Have you got a pencil?
What were the crows after at the school?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
I'm cold as ice.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
Where can I find him?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
She's unconscious.
What's that you say?
See that, Fettes?
You've no thought of going there?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
A doctor?
Don't call me that confounded name.
No.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
Can anyone hear what we say?
But where did they get those people?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Where are they?
I'm looking for my friends.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Two down. Two to go.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Where is it? This place?
Fuck! What do you want?
What did they give you?
I heard you were looking for this.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Erin. It's not your fault.
Erin. Who?
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
No.
About you.
Sweetheart...
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
No -- not at all.
That can easily be arranged.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Go to the movies.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Why not, Bobby?
We certainly did.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
The present situation?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
May I see you for a minute?
What happened?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
It must be twelve-thirty.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
But how -- how long--?
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Time to activate Plan B.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Two down and two to go.
Honda 250, huh?
David.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Thanks, Grandpa...
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Whatcha doin' over here?
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
You've heard this story before?
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
What did you say?
Not funny, Sam!
But, Mom...
Mom!
Lucy.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Let's go see them.
When?
Take laddie.
Huh?
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
What would that make Mom?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
Star.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Yeah.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Too damn dangerous.
Somebody broke in.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
What's happening?
Torch it over there!
What?
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Would that test have worked?
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
How many in their party?
Put that down!
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
What kind of test?
Get back!!
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Maybe it ain't coming.
Then we go after him.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
Send him away.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
This has to end.
Vox --
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
That was a foolish thing to do.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
All right...
No... let's walk through the city.
My God...
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Do you know you were humming?
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
Did you hear me, lad?
Why not?
Thank you.
I can see Kalen's point.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
You know that's not true.
Yes, sir.
What did you do at night?
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
I don't understand...
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
I looked it up.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Do you really believe me?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
Where are we going?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You were convicted of the crime.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
How do you know about Eugene?
Who...who kills me?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
I tried to kill my wife.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
[Beat] How do you know?
You ever been to jail?
Why "of course"?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
Hon.
Darryl.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
In the leg.
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
How are things goin' out there?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
What kind of gun was it?
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
How?
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Not yet.
Call me back.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Why now, Jimmy?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Is this your car?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
How come he let you go?
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Thelma!
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Exactly.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Yes.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
You think you've found your calling?
Thelma.
Yeah.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
I... I...
What?!
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Thelma, that is not an option.
You awake?
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
About two hundred and fifty miles.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
What in the hell is that up there?
What in the hell is it?!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I don't know.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Mary's a babe!
No You mean...?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
The sawbones?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
What's that?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
A surprise?
Have you seen it?
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Fuck!!
All set.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
What do you mean?
How'd you manage that one?
Nice.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Four.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
I'd go with the seven.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
What's a mook?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Bundt cake?
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Pat's an architect, too.
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
I think you'd better sit down.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Yeah?
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But but what about Steve?
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Oh God.
Piggyback ride.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
John. How much time?
What's happened?
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
Let's get out of here.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
Just a second, Mr. President.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Who are you?
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
How'd you know?
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
What?!
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
I don't see the connection.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
It's not real.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Where was this?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
What's that?
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
X21. Come back.
Mister Tully.
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
How did you know this was my car?
What would?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
I'm special.
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
It dies. We live.
You're horrible
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Danger?
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Do what, show you a good time?
What do you do when you come here?
I sit. I think. I play games.
Goose is dead.
Off me or off you?
Looks like a tie.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
I live here, remember?
Well?
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
280, 290, 300 knots.
You're not supposed to...
Did what?
That's not what I heard.
Tom Kazansky.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
What now?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
What the hell you doing?
Yes sir..
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
I'm nothing like him.
Over there man.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
What happened to number five?
What do you want?
Get it, please.
Fuck you.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Yes, sir.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
So, been married long?
Eight years.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Where?
Sit down.
You're Kuato, right?
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I've got a lock!  There!
Mmmm.....
Let's do it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Well...What do you say?
What are you doing?
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
You went to those brain butchers?!
Let me finish!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
It was implanted by the Agency.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
I suppose you're not here either.
Mars.
This is too weird.
She wasn't really my wife.
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't need Kuato for that.
What reactor?!
Aliens built it.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Its tires are flat...
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Down, honey, down.
And I appreciate it.
Think it's still following us?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Don't hurt him.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Not the whole time, of course. I --
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
We have a full caseload, Rog.
Of course.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
That DD-5.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
Let's get a cab.
I embroidered.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Want to tell me what went down here?
Shu Kai Kim.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
No.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
A woman.
Blonde.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
And no one found the ring?
Sorry to hear it.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
What do you mean?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
A blue rose.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
Maybe, later we could take a look.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
You better dust this place, Sam.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
I don't know what to do.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Maybe I better start our homework.
No, you should forget about last night.
I can't help you there.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Nice night.
Maybe.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
What does Bob say?
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I already made you two tapes.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
You mean the ones you pity.
No.
You're getting warmer.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
School?
A friend from school.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
He was accused of jury tampering.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
I...
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Ed Concannon.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
I was her doctor.
...We did everything we could...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
I. Yes. It is.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Her doctors killed her.
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
How old is he?
Yes.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
I'm a lawyer.
Maybe I can do something right.
What...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
No.
Thank you.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Missus...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
It's locked.
...I'm sure you do...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Another, Frank...?
Yeah.
Mick. Mick. Mick...
What?
Who have we got?
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Right.
Today is Tuesday. What?
...one of the other nurses?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...four years ago...
In New York?
Yes.
Yes.
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
They've all stopped at the same time.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Yes, but...
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
No, you don't.
Guess so.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Finish, please!
This is going to give you nightmares.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Do you have to die to see God?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
What...what is that?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Darker.  More...evil?
Yeah...how'd you know?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Is Chase Porter your husband?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
No, not really.  I...
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Black's fine.
Did we lose anybody?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
He knows.
We were idealists.
What are they doing?
I didn't know sir.
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Make us proud.
Gieg, Chuck.
Believe what?
I couldn't have done it without you.
You know, I never had friends like this.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
He does.
Why'd you do it?
Yes.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
My parents don't do it anymore.
What are they doing?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
What?!  What's happening?!!
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
We'll think of something.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What do you think?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
It's outta here!
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
No.
What makes you so sure it was one?
... Absolutely not.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Easy for you to say.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
How old are you?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
No.
No... I don't think so, man.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
She really say she was pregnant?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
What happened on the charges?
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Hasta siempre.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
What's that?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You up for that?
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
What kinda trash talk is that?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I do.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Where?
You think he saw us?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
More'n likely.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
Oh God, Sailor.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Yeah?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That was in Vietnam.
What?
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
I'll bet.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
What if I asked you not to?
Take care of him?
Yes.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
You need to explain it.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Where we goin'?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
So I hear.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
He is. Take my word for it.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Kidnapped? By who?
How bad is it for you?
So sensitive.
Want some help with that?
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Naturally you have copies.
I passed out.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Her dog, yes.
Better luck next time.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
You're in Kinship?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Well...
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Can I ask you something about her?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
Afraid so.
Washed up?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Humboldt County?
The one that left you?
I'm sorry.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Yes, James.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
James Leer.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I guess you have to go on faith.
You don't deserve me, you know.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
James is... I don't know...
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
The perpetrator.
No, the dog.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Annette? She's good... tense.
Cherry.
It wasn't like that.
Then what? What?!
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
The birthday party.
No thanks.
Aren't you glad?
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
I'm just talking, man.
What are you looking at?
Birds.
Try.
I can't.
Don't you have friends?
I haven't broken any laws.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
What's with the boxes?
Are you taking your medication?
I'm twelve.
Walter.
Robin?
What?
Does he?
Your daddy will always love you.
You should go home.
That's right.
It's okay.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Why do you think you're here?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
Is this the first one?
In my bed too.
But roughly, how old?
A nap?
Don't ever do that again.
What?
What?
You must hate it.
They could eat you.
I'm not easily shocked.
I get that impression.
I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?
So, what did you do?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Their power. They seduce me.
I know.
Neither am I.
Just think about it.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Wasn't up to me.
What are you still wearing that for?
I haven't worn mine in months.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
What about O-2?
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Try again.
We've only got one suit.
God, I hate that bitch.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Yes.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Are you joking?
Claudia, let's get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Aren't you going to change?
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
Have you ever been in love?
You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
Is that far from here?
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Of God.
Why?
Why?
Should you see a doctor?
No I don't.
Let's talk about something else.
Yes.
Uh huh.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Yes.
And you like that?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Agnes...
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
Would you like some?
Why not?
One.
Where do you think babies come from?
Like what?
Why not?
Is that what she said?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
She...
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
No I'm not.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Did you want it to come out?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Who?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Frightened.
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Are you frightened?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Not your fault...
I hate him.
???
Something they... that they overlooked.
Thanks. 
I'll have it.
No!
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
The one up on the third floor?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
What's his name?
I've already told you what I thought.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
???  
There's another choice.
Was the child full term?
An unhappy woman...
Bullshit yourself!
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Mary Magdelen?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
The father!
Well give me a reasonable explanation
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Somebody told her.
Where is she?
Who knew she was pregnant?
Is it because she's a nun?
She didn't want any help.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
She can't remember.
The usual ten per cent?
Shurrup!
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
I'm a deserter, too.
Yeah.
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
I'll murder that Lennon.
I've made the scene.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
But I won't.
Should I say it?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Oh!
Go away! You've spoilt it.
How'd you guess?
Gear?
What's that mean?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
Out where?
Oh ... I dunno.
Have they?
Come on let's get this coffee.
Anything to spare?
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
Hi Norm!
Oh you are, I know you are.
I'm not, no.
I would have said so.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
None for me, then?
He's been gone a long time.
Down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
What?
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
What is he?
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Yes!
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
What do you mean?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
It's clear.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
Yes?
Still unconscious?
Yes.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
Can you get them back?
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
What do you mean, no?
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
What's wrong?
What'd he say?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
But?
Find anything we missed?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Still worried?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
I understand why you did that.
Where did the parasites come from?
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Now what?
Can we get to him?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Shit.  When?
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
You win some, you loose some.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
It's too late!
What?  Where?
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Is this the suit?
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Okay, we're in business.
Four.
What?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
What time's sundown?
It needn't be.
You take charge.
Just some coffee.
I don't think that's funny.
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
What of it?
She was a liar, she was a liar!
Then say so.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Margo.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Didn't you know?
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Bill...
You've already met.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
It's a good thought.
So she seems.
I don't think that's funny!
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
For instance - you!
Okay. Mix.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
It's not nonsense.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Yes. Yes, it does.
From what would I be running?
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Find out.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Do you want an argument or an answer?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
That's the door.
Not at all.
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
He can help you.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
The curtains. I made them myself.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
How was the concert?
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Where is she?
How's the new one coming?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
To you, too?
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Call, what call?
That's right, but I don't understand-
Well...
I promise.
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
We understand your problem--
Who'd you vote for?
Go on, go on--
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
--has he got an ax?--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
What's the matter?
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
Night.
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
And you will.  But not now.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
--you don't really think you're being followed?
Hey, easy...
One minute but then--
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Which people?
What do you want to know?
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
Something maybe big.
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
What happens when the baby comes?
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
...check...?
...you're definitely doing a story...?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Talk about Segretti--
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
--yes, yes, what is it?
Security consultant.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Lotsa hints--
--who you got?--
--has any of them got an ax?--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--which Young?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Haldeman.  Right?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
A boy or a girl?
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
What the hell was that?
No, it was good.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Of course, Finch.  What?
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Not bad, Chris.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
What?  No I'm not.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Stifler told me.
Onions?
You want onions?
So we're gonna be close next year?
This isn't any better, Chris.
No comment.
I don't get it, that really works?
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
I told you.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
She's a mermaid, dude.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
I still think you're okay.
Shame on you!
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
God dammit, Stifler!
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Hey...
See -- this is the nicest room.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
What?
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Ha-ha!
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Serafine...
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
What makes you so sure this will work?
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
I know where he'll go.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
You recognize her?
We know you were with her.
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
What about me?
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Why were you so late tonight
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Hurry, Grandmama!
Where is your home, Anya?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
I'm so scared...
Anya, wait!
Trust me, it's her!
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Bartok... a question.
You're a princess...
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Who's on television?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
He was creepy.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
So sorry.
Uh, you're driving a-
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Well, who's Sadie?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Fifteen years, huh?
God bless.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
No, I'm gonna quit!
Gimme a kiss.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay.
Okay?
As Balzac said...
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
M'hm.
No, I'm not.
Do I love you?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
It relaxes me.
Oh, you have my body.
M'hm.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Who cares? Who cares?
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Will it change my life?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Oooh.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Yeah.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Oh, Jesus, really?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
yes, we had, uh...
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
You're mad, aren't you?
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
You catch Dylan?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Well, sit down.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
And... uh-
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
All right-so we can afford it.
Well, hi!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
...of possibly working together.
Yeah.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
It has your ring.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Honey?
Don't you miss it?
Really?
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
He's not going tonight.
Directing suits you.
The suspense is killing me.
You need to call your dad.
And you know our friends, how?
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Oh yeah...
I call that a perfect day.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Give him a minute, Clair.
We closed.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
I adore him.
We've only been over this how many times?
Did you invite them?
What did you get me?
What?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
She left the fucking gate open.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Love?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Cal, too?
Don't do this!
What?!  You aborted our child?!
He's my favorite.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
You lose this?
How long have you been married?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
I so wish I'd known.
I'm sorry.
Is there space here?
Oh?
Thank you.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
She's even better looking in the flesh.
It could be worse.
Fuck you, Panes.
Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I wasn't finished.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Well, something's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Thank you, Panes.
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Like Joe.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
I hope they're watercolors!
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
You're right!
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Worker!  Come back here now!
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Oh, no, sir!
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
...Ants...
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
My mother.
Not there.  Under the mat.
Something the matter?
Ma'am?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Care to make a small wager?
What did you do to your hair?
So I see.
How come?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Of course not.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Why?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
No doubt about it.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
I just want some fresh air.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I never thought he'd do it.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
Oh.
I'm fine all over.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Where is your apartment?
How do you work it with the key?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Well -- I guess so.
Put me down for Thursday again.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
You're going to take her off my hands?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
What's her name?
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Just as long as she's okay.
I'm not sure.
Sure, Doc.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Can I ask you a personal question?
No kidding.
Good night.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Coming?
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
It's a thought.
Well --
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
I said I like all of them.
Two whole drums --
Winning the war by yourself.
North ?
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
A long time.
Holy shit.
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
What are you doing out here?
Probably is.
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
How much is left?
Flood.
I --
Will they attack?
What do you want ?
What -- happened here.
Yeah.
No, sir.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Change.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Haiphong.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Fucking savages.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
You can't have water after morphine.
No water.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Yes, I know...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
You hear it again?
What's this tiger shit?
That's me.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
His name is...
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
215  CONTINUED:
Avalanche season is coming.
Oh.
You should know something.
Was there any trouble?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
You're hurt.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Be my guest.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
How many do you see?
You don't feel cold?
Stay still.
Don't bet on it.
Shut up!
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
All this for laying traps on private land?
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
I need to rent a cabin.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
It's Sam Wilder!
There's what they're waiting on!
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Two days.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Nonsense!
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
You don't owe me that.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I don't.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Okay to say something now?
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Grouchy?
What a break...
Yes. I really would.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Help!
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Please, just leave.
Would you leave now, please?
Melvin...
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
What's it mean?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
So you're practically finished, huh?
So you're from around here?
What is this?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Why don't you tell me.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
I know what happened.
I bet you fucking know!
Is this how it went, Nick?
Um, five.
Yes.
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
The C.I.A.?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No, they didn't.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Then you went freelance?
Tell me about the first time.
They become complicated... messy.
You said you didn't trust it.
What?
Okay.
Sorry.
Thank you.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Ten years ago.
What happened?
Was that it?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
How do you know they're not?
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
And you were drilling these holes...?
Yes.
Who was she?
Did you --
Were you attracted to me right away?
When did it start?
Honestly?
I waited another four minutes.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
I prefer it like this.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Why not?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
What are you thinking about?
Can I ask you a question?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Like Custer huh?
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Tell them we're working for the University.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Need any disks?
Perfect!
Let's split.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
You capitalist pig!
Damn!
What happened?
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
So?
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
And if you're wrong.
It's...42 56 76 .
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Yeah, no problem.
Take this exit.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Sure. Excellent.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
No.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
What for?
You mean it's started?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Where did you steal the car?
That's right.
Yeah!
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
So, he didn't fire you?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Josh!
It's more than what you're worth.
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
So, who is in the building?
Have you lost all control of this city?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
It could help with a new car --
Out with Belinda?
Were you with Jamie?
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Now it's okay?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Don't call him a dipshit.
Deranged.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
I'm very sorry --
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
What is that?
Saturn. Beautiful.
No.
You have to believe to have faith.
He doesn't trust you.
You're not in a very good mood.
Hey.
Yes. But not as a date date.
Your turn.
How do you know this place?
When did you build this?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
You planned this --
I don't care.
That what you do?
One of your secrets.
Why didn't you tell me?
Help me live until I die?
No. I want what's best for you.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
No.
You have materials for the side bearings?
I thought she built it herself.
Yes.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Huh?
You remember me...?
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Learn anything?
The sunrise? What for?
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Who, me?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
What?!
You answered the door!
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
What do you call this? 
Dick? Dick who?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Yeah, I guess.
Does he bite?
We did it, Ray.
You like people?
They're okay.
Then why'd you do it?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
Great.
I know.
Don't call me stupid.
Is he upset?
Think I got 'em?
I don't know.
You tired?
Really?
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
What crate?
Let her out. In my custody.
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
Who?
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Oh, my.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Pick those up, Reno.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
I write.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
A souse!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
What do you do far a living?
...Barton, is everything okay?
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
...I don't guess this means much to you.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Charlie. How are you.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Hold on –
Jesus, Charlie, I...
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Must be.
Excuse me?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
How about the coke?
Yes.
You okay?
Catherine Tramell.
You should do something about this lock.
What are you doing here?
Did you leave the club with him?
I don't smoke.
How did you feel when he died?
Am I... disturbing you?
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
She wiped out her whole family.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Aren't you going to thank me?
What's it about?
Why take the risk?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Can I talk to you a minute?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
It teaches you to lie.
What kind of drugs?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Do you remember his name?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
You don't like punk rockers?
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Where the hell you goin'?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
Who are you?
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
Ouch..
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
Piss painting?
MOTHAFUCKAH!
I didn't see you.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
How is he?
I really... admire you.
Me? Why?
Hi.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
You like your dad's paintings?
I don't eat junk food.
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
You see? You have someone to live for.
So keep painting.
What time is it?
I'll make you another one.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I will relay the message.
Hanging on every word.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Pouring myself into my work.
Had one.  Didn't work.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
I don't.  So, no.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Please be looking for me.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
What exactly are you doing?
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
No!?
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
You're not even listening to me.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
I wouldn't bet on that.
Well...um...her.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Dick, don't push me right now.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
There's one other thing. I feel..
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
He's home. I sent the signal.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Rinka.
To kill me.
He sure did.
What?
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
What?
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Who is it?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Look! Police!
What about the girl?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
What is it you want?
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
All street mimes should be executed.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Joker here. Can we talk?
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
... Thank you.
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Peanuts?
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
There aren't hotels?
Do we know anything about him?
It's the last thing we need.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
There were three strawberries.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Right first time.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Oh yes.
She's ... well, she's good.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
No!
And a car.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Of course he is.
What's gone?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Me first!
Me first.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Bunghole...
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Ah, the witness?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Here's something.
I guess we open it.
And your sushi was remarkable.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
We're...
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
What do you mean?  What's he do?
About what?
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Are you a spirit too?
I... I don't know what your name is.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
You've got to help them.

Otho?
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
What do you think, honey?
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Otho, that's terrible.
Yes. I think so, too.
... Straight out?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
... But he's...?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I have no idea...
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Chauncey...
How is Ben feeling?
Yes.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
I see.
Ben is very ill.
I feel very good in here.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Yes. I like to watch.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
What about money?
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... How long have you been living here?
Compensated...?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
Try again.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... How are the kids getting along?
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Gardiner, yes, sir.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Right, Chief.
Oh? What?
Well, Ben... I...
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Yeah.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Enjoy.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Seven-ish
Now?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Why?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
What are you doing?
What?
And he was with her.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
The monkey.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
People make mistakes.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
I know. I'm sorry...
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
I said "yes."
I am a trained performer.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Yes, well...
Somebody told you.
The usual, Barry.
My tits?
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Lotte? Is that you?
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Yes, my dear?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
How do we do that?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
How'd you get this number?
Can I get you a drink?
Do you mind?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Vegas.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Well, if you want my opinion...
You grown.
In case of what?
But mama..
No...no...no..
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
I know Denver.
True.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Never found out.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
She was only-
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Who is she? Where she come from?
All he can. All he can.
Sethe?
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
What, baby?
Hiya Allan.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah?
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
Yeah, it sucks.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
NUSSING!
Can we just rent it from you?
What's this?
What the fuck is he talking about?
What do you mean, Dude?
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
What--
He peed on the Dude's rug--
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
He's handicapped, huh?
Far out.
Are these.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Ahh, not so good, man.
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Far from it.
What's your drink, Dude?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Yeah man.
Excuse me?
Oh, no.
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
And please don't call her my mother.
Now I got--
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
What happened to your house?
Jeffrey--
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Increases?
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Oh shit.  Walter.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
FUCK.
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
Walter--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
What about the toe?
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
They're nihilists.
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Uh-huh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
You know this!
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
What's mine is mine.
Wha. . . Donny--
Walter--
Dude here.
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
WHAT?!
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Well. . . yeah.
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
I'll heal.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
You don't want to go there.
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
Nomak?
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
We're locked in.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going somewhere?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're not going anywhere.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
You used me as bait?!
Graffiti --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Just get out of here.
I've been better --
Get out of here --
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Why do you hunt them?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
--and if she ever did--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
What happened to her, where did she go?
No.
--I'm not staying here!
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
I don't know. Nightmare.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Yeah.
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
I don't know yet.
--go!
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
--I saw what I saw.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
--a Wiccan--
I'm not finished.
Asleep--
Spite.
Let's get inside.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
What--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
She got <u>paid</u>.
What?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Still working on it.
Get some more beer.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
She's far from "fine."
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
--it's urgent!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
On the phone. Was it for you?
I could've sworn I heard something.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...So?
Remy.
He needs a room, Dusty.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
No.
Sign.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Then what'd you come here for?
If the pay's right I'll do it.
Well what?
What do you think?
Of course.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
Has Ray come in yet?
Red Label.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
To your health, Frank.
Yes?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
No. not at all.
Hello, baby.
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
I . I don't know.
Do you like talk like that?
No.
No.
Thank you. honey.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Hi. can I come in?
Nice guy.  Who's he?
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
No. I should go.
Come in.
I sure don't hate you.
What do you want to do?
Yes.
I asked first.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
What?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I've gotta go in.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Oh, okay. can I call?
Yeah.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
You want to tell me about it?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You didn't tell him about me?
What was that all about?
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
No Jeffrey!!
Good to see you, son.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
He comes over to study.
On the plane.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
And I only deal with you?
What did I tell you?
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
What do you got there, Diego?
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
No, my brother.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Where do I put this!?
Barbara.
Yeah.  Nice.
It's beautiful.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
George, you look terrible.
I know.
What are you going to do?
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
Hi.
No.
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
That was a beautiful message.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Hello.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no?
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Not in front of the kid.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Dad.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
I fucked up.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Stoned?
Yeah?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Are we good?
Nice weed, huh?
No shit, Kevin?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
I understand. What's your question?
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
What ... What must I decide?
Then don't complain.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Read it.
No, and neither were my men.
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
Why?
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Why?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
Yes.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Yes.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
How did he look?
About a year and half ago.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
And how are you now?
Why did she say she was leaving?
She didn't.  She just left.
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
What did she say?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Yes.
You'll be sorry?
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Yes.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Why not?
That's not an answer.
Hello?
Hi, Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Rebecca -- take these off.
What's that for?
You killed him -- didn't you?
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
No, Your Honor.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
I am relaxing.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
SO!
I don't mind waiting.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Michael.
What?!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Don't say that!
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I bet mom could've helped her.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Roseman Bridge?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
What?
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
No, I'm just saying --
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
I'll pick you up.
Can I help?
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Trouble. Why?
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
STOP IT!
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
WHY?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Later. Go back to sleep.
Franny?
Betty.
Oh my God...!
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
About an hour ago.
They're not going to find her!
Hey, kid.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Shit.
You got a nice crib here.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Jimmy, you've got --
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Why?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Lucky thing.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
What are we doing down here?
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Sit down, Gino!
Jesus, Caesar!
What are you going to do with it?
What are you talking about?
It couldn't have been.
But you know he did it.
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
I need you ...
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Caesar ...
...  maybe three hours.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Where, then?
What did she do to you?
They were in a car accident.
You know he would have done you, too.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
How many'd you do?
Lick me.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
What?  They ain't there?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay, sure, Mick.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Who?
Okay, one drink.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
He's a launderer?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Shit, here we go.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Even though he knew about you?
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Mickey?
You said he washed the money?
He hung it up.
And where is it now?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
He does it right in front of him.
What time did you say they would be there?
I had a partner and she fucked me.
I won't.
It's me.
How'd it go?
Johnnie, what did I say?
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I know you will.
And what if I couldn't do that?
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
What do you want to do?
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So it's time to go home.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
I don't think so.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Sir, you waited on line.

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride out of here.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
What if I say no?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
What are you talking about?
I was shot twice in the back.
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
I don't know. 
xxxxxx
Get in the basement.
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- I'm on it --
-- we're evacuating the building --
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
I think we'd better have a look.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Jack!
Hello, Jack!
Jack!!
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
Very smart.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
They weren't at school with us.
Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I didn't like it.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Well, no system is.
Who is this war against, Sam?
What?
You're joking.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Yes.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Would you really, Sam?
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
Tuttle?
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
You are good to me Sam.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You haven't switched it on.
Hey - that's my desk!
I'm sorry but ...
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
This is an emergency!
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Are we?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
No, no, that's impossible.
She say she in great pain.
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Frank Pierce.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
You're going to live.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
IB Bangin.
What?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
At least he's got people around him.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Yes.
Sleeping.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
He's better.
Not as good as Nino's.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
You asked me not to come.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
That's too many.
You can't believe how much he's improved.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
How's he doing?
What do you want to break?
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
What?
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
No?
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Eleven and a half.
We can cut back at the end.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
No.
This is important to me.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
How?
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Don't say anything about anything.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Okay.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
Just a few questions?
Yes.
And Bobbie says...
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Nobody else had it.
That's okay.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Bye, sweetie.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
No.  Not even you.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
I like "godsend."
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Whoa, this was a mistake.
Jane?
Well, what is it?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
No.  Were you going to you?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
Because you're nuts.
What?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Where's the bathroom?
That's enough.  That's enough.
Are you okay?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Oh it's enough...
Not even a little bit?
Um...
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Alright we're clear.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Hi Walter...
Murdered...man?...
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
Now what kind of statue was that?
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Well, w-what did you do?
No...look I'm busy...
Hello, Walter.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
You're gonna shoot me!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Man has a complex.
I... feel.... pretty.
Yes.
Something like that.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Didn't you get my message?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Dress, huh?  What for?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Why don't we see a movie?
Where?
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
I wish you would.
I was just scared is all.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Why?  Why me?
You think so?
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Oh, thank you very much.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
I am.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
What?
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
How was that?
You can't seduce me.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
I'd like you to meet my father.
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
You're pulling your hips out.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
He' s confused--
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
What's so great about baseball?
Why not?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Yeah...you a witch?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Don't bump me.
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
He did know.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
How come you don't like me?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
I'm trying to thank you.
No.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
What'you want, kid?
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
That's right.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Was I at that dinner?
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Eight.
Somethin', huh?
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
Nope, there's no way.
In other words, I'm fucked.
Hello.
...very difficult to get in.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yeah.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
Listen, I would -
Meet me at three.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Ginger called me.
I just told you. She called me.
And what'd she want?
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
No, Ace.
Half of everything is mine.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Why not make them happy?
Sam, we got a problem.
Now, he's really pissed.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
No, he didn't.
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring...
Okay.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
...twenty-five thousand?
And...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Loose machines are right back over there.
Yeah, okay.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
This is not the way to treat people.
When I left here with the money...
Sam?
He won't let me in my own house!
Can I go in?
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Hey!
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Now move along.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
It's in all the papers.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Mm.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Tell me.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
I can see that. Sure.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
He gives a fuck what I do?
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Oh, come on.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm sorry.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Yes.
No, Lester.
Right.
He was just on the phone.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
They check in alone?
Incredible.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
You walk past me?
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
They'll do it.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
You sure?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Yeah.
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Have we reached the epi-center?
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
I've been looking for you.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
Spooky.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Did you try to kill...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Nice breasts.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
What if they do question the authenticity?
Theo wants to talk again.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Lady, don't let him do it!
Or relieve me of it later.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Bullshit.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
If you know that just back off.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Where'd they take you to?
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What about the others?
What are you doing now?
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
What do you do for a living?
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
Does she wear glasses?
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
What's going on?
It won't be him.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Why can't it be her?
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
He had a gun.  I have it now.
There isn't any such person.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
A typical fuck-up.
What's that supposed to me?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Do you think they'll walk away?
Any idea where you're going?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Took preparation.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Who is this?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Got a phone in that van?
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
You should've done all this before.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Stop the crying.
I can see the benefit in that.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
I thought so.
Then why doesn't she?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
You could always make it up to her.
How?
Just cut his hair, you know.
What you think?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Maybe he wants something.
Stop it, Dil --
Fuck it, is what I say.
You fucking promised.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
No.
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
You on the game?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
They're jealous.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Dil --
Give it over, Dil --
Do you care, Jimmy?
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
I miss you, Jimmy.
So I got it wrong, then.
What's her?
Why?
Yes.
Don't call me that --
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You tried.
I like you, Dil --
Love you, Dil.
Say it again.
Never.
She was --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
That's wise, Tommy.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Eddie and Tinker died.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
Give him a cup of tea.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
What?
Would make me feel better about it.
I'm sure.
Who'd you think it was?
Definitely unusual.
Who is he?
Eat something, would you?
No fucking way.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
They won't let him die.
You could have said no.
And you play cricket?.
Hurry up, would you?
Why?
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
We don't look on it like that.
Is it bad?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Faster than cricket?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Have you no feelings, woman?
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Where's that airlines bag?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
I believe you.
Were you followed?
Agents.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Do I knock or something?
Keep going.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Your --
Sure.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Whitefoot, of course.
The phone's ringing --
Who?
Alex --
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Then I suggest you call one of them.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Shut the door!
Why don't you shut up!
Go on.
And the last one?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Tell me what?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Swiss.
About how wealthy would you say?
Where did he keep his money?
Did you?
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
What are you doing here?
How did you find out?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
What your husband was mixed up in.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
I believe what he said.
What are you talking about?
Don't put yourself out.
Because I don't love him.
I've never seen him before.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I get the imports.
So?
Hi honey.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
What's wrong?
No honey.
It can't be.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She's not here.
You know where I can find her?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
I know where you're going.
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
I'm sure you should have failed.
I am.
You aren't going to the party?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
What do you know about my father?
_ Your father raped someone?
Yes.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Oh nice save.
Not that many.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
This place is empty.
Don't you think it's sick?
Why?
I heard you got attacked.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I'll think about it.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Hi mom.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Yes.
You're so beautiful.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Stacy?

...-ty.
No argument there.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Since today.  New policy.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
He could've called first.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
And if that Elvis shit...
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I got, uh....
I need your truck!
Go on.
Are you kiddin'?

We're clear.
That's...
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.


Take your gun!
    Elvis is on ice again.
 Nice job back there.
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...you.
...let live.
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Holy shit...
...we can make it.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!
 Oh...
...easy, easy, easy.

Whoo!
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!
Ho, ho...
 
Hey!

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
 Aw, shit  
All right, let's go.
...to him!  You don't know who...

This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
Okay.
You're fucked, man.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Put your hand in my pants.

Go, go, go! 
You got Elvis?!

...tunnel!
Come on.  Come on.
 
What?
It's working.

...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Hey.

To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
We're worried...

This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
...here.   Mason... 
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
You-You can't let him...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
...owe you.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
They were all wearing hardware.

I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...and the government.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Almost quaint.
I can't say it's a surprise.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him.
Check the immediate area.
What about these two?
I'm on it.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
...-ty.
It's a hundred degrees...
Assumptions are always...
...deer.
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...never done a thing for you?
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
...-tainer!

...-time,  remember?
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Secrets.
...now!

And where are you going?
...-son.

And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
Tie a fly...
...without caution...
...fishin'.
The compound has to be kept cold...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
...that the prey can bite back.
Dr.  Long!
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
What?  Say again, Ma-...
...you answer mine.
Got that?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...stole a truck under arrest.
...side!
...we're all gonna die in this...
What the hell was that?
The Army, sealin' us in.

 Talk to me.
Oh.
Negative.  Negative.
Take it easy, Jake.
Then these are all new owners?
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Where from?
Very.
None.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
My daughter.
She's fine.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
Hello.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Could you drive me somewhere?
I don't know...
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
Jake, listen.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Why?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Who?
Absolutely.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
A private investigator?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
...Just a minute...
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
My husband.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
No, not for that one.
Another satisfied client?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
No.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
And Hollis knew about it?
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Working for the District Attorney.
Yeah.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
What's wrong?
Where?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
It's possible.
Including the death of your husband?
You bastard.
What does it look like?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Upstairs. Why?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
I have to go home and get my things.
With us.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Where'd he go yesterday?
I think I got something.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Ida Sessions.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
I never was.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Si.
When it comes.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Since lunch.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
They were partners.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Yeah?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
You weren't expecting me?
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
For what?
You're still beautiful...
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
I can't take shorthand.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
You don't really think so?
I might make him nervous.
What's the matter?
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Ask them to sit down.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
Oh yes, there is.
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Toothache.
Oh!
On the chiffonier.  Here.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I won't let you go.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
You goin', Mom?
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Poor Mr. Carter!
Tired?
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Yes?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Hello, Brad.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
I know, but -
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
What's this?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
I think you'd better leave now.
That's it, everybody out.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
How like her.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
But can we date?
You work in a market, all right.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
He's your fiancé.
Who doesn't?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
With this guy locked in?
What about Caitlin?
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Pack of cigarettes.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
You're late.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
She called me.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
You win.
Allan Harris.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
What's that?
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
What did he say?
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Sorry.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Design major.
Helluva game!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
You know what Sanford told me? 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
No, you're not.
Stop it.
Oh, my god.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
Five hundred dollars.
I don't; you did.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Now I know you're lying.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
What time did we go to the funeral?
I should shit or get off the pot.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
To talk to you.
Same time. What about you?
Do I know you?
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Yeah?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
Veronica.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Why do you say that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
It better be up to and including me.
What the hell was that for?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
No; who were the three, besides me?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
What do you mean?
He gets off on it.
You sucked his dick!
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Please calm down.
Dante...
Let it go...
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Really?  You're the best.
What're you talking about?
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
I didn't do that!
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
No way!
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
How long you gonna be here?
I... I don't know what to say.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
So, what do you see?
You know how the airlines are.
The money!
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Not on that leg.
Sure you can.
Four...five...
The winds are picking up.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Gabe!?
What are you doing here!?
For the same reason you did, to help.
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
Never, what?!
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
On top of the peak.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Been punished, yeah?
Good evening.
Great, sir. Great.
No. She's dead!
Phoned some friends, sir?
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
So this is the young man?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Good evening, my boy.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Helping you, sir?
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Well - I'm back.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
You wanna be sick?
Murder, sir.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Vitamins will it be then?
Something like that.
Just part of hospital routine.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
What?
Like what?
Most of the time.
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
A deer?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
You know Dmitri?
What kind of question?
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
What?
Very generous.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
What are you gonna do?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
What if they're wrong?
I got caught up at work.
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
It's home.
You mean like benefits?
Me, specifically?
I don't think I can do this.
Max.
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What?
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
I don't know any Rwandans.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
I'm sorry.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
Who's Heller?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
What'd they do?
Slow the hell down!
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
She must be some girl.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
Switch the charts.
Yeah.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
What is it with you and the space program?
You okay?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Can you prove any of this?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Never, but I've been practicing.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Is he dead?
What van?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Okay, I will.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
You look great.
Now what?
Where are we going, Jerry?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Did you kill my father?!
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Love at first sight?
Back where?
They'll trace it.
Geronimo is down.
You think it's a conspiracy?
That's great.  Good for you.
What's that?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
Excuse me?
You've asked me that one three times.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
The truth shall make you free.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
Wasn't my idea.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
Yes, sir.
So?
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Ellie...
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Actually I'm running late --
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
You...
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
Got a bogey, boss?
This is how you see the sky?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
So who -- what -- are you?
Can you show me?
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
No more stalling, Captain.
No.  Please.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
The systems integration site.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
I'd say this is slightly different.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Peter Valerian.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
Any luck on the grant money?
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Ellie --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
And where exactly does that put your position...?
And mind, yes.  What are you --
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
What'd you think?
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
What...?
What?
What are you so afraid of?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
But I made this arrangement --
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
That's good: he earned it.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
A cold drink.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
No. No chains either.
What did I do?
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
I want to die.
What?  What'd I do?
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
We'll get the paramedics...
Yes.  Without question.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
When was that?
I never hurt nobody...
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
No.  Not yet.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
I think this is number three...
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Yes.  I have to go...
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Answer it.
You came in there with this attitude...
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Right.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
Sergeant?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
So what have we got?
How'd you get in on the deal?
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
It is?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
Do you find him attractive?
I thought that was you, up there.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Please finish your story.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Crash victim?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I did this already.
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
Maybe.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
What about the engagement party?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Don't be fresh.
I'm really not that hungry.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
Green spot.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
What's my rap?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Just checking.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
I love the pillows.
It's TV heaven.
I love your apartment.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Not yet.
Good luck.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Why'd you tell?
Silly, silly, silly.
I sure know what that feels like.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
But what about that math project?
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Yeah.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
What?
I think I've heard this speech before.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Zero.   That's all I know.
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Oui.
My number's going to show up on his bill!
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
We can't.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
Hadley --
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
What'd you get?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
What do you want now?
Don't bullshit me.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
What'd they take?
Everything.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
No, I didn't.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
I knew I should have driven.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
I think we went the wrong way.
And how do we do that?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
Something like that.
You ask a lot of questions.
Who are you waiting for?
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Yes.
Go ahead.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Please sit.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You say she killed a policeman?
Here you must be in proper attire.
Yes.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Have you questioned him yet?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
Then, why did you come?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
And you're gonna tell me who.
You buying?
No onions?
Could be.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
Don't interfere.
Mister Funboy.
In a better place.  I hope.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
I wish to possess what you have now.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Get it?
Go away.
Shut up.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
...necklace... pearls...
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Nothing.
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
You implied it.
It was fine.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Okay?
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
I'm doing some volunteer work.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
No.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
You really want to know?
I think that's for the best.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Are you for real?
It was nothing.
No.
Something awful happened last night.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
What do I do then?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Good night Cecile.
Yummy.
Good luck, Sebastian.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Yes!
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
What are the terms?
You can put it anywhere.
Call me later.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
So? How'd it go last night?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I think you have your answer.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
I've already told you, she's not home.
What do you want?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
I love the smell of pine.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Irena.
I know that.
Yes, darling,
Something's haywire,
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Yes, daddy.
Can't you tell me later?
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Daddy!
Yes, Amy?
Who are you?
Irena. But who are you?
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
I'm trying to.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry!
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Yes...yes, that's true.
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
And Amy mailed them?
No it's mom.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Can't you get contacts?
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
DON'T call the police.
Why not? There's been a murder.
Peter keeps asking me out.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I thought you and George were getting married.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
You're kidding, really?
They say sex is great for cramps.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Yes I do have to pee!
Uh huh. So pee.
You look different. I mean you look good.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Mark.
Script coverage?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
You busted me.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
It's stupid.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Goodnight.
Was there anything in that washer?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Is that how you feel?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Be careful!
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
We didn't have sex.
We can get a warrant if you like.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
You want her sheets?
See he was cheating from the get go.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
What?
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
The park dude was missing an arm.
He means the last that we know of.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
What's he doing here?
His wife.
What is this place?
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Good.
Why, yes.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Look!  This is a good one!
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
If you like.
Horrible...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
First Lady...
For a month.
The Washington Post.
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Fine?
Check his kids.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
So you want to go swimming?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
I don't think so
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
What happened?
Will he be alright?
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Fine.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
They asked me to help.
You're leaving?
How were you gonna get home?
What?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You really believe that?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
Then why did you come here?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
What?
What you wanna do?
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Where are you going, Tyler?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
At Chet Danburry's house.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Yeah?  Like what?
I think he's sweet.
I'm not?
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
But, Chris...
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Then come with me.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Meeks.
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
AHHHHHH!
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Isn't there an easier way?
All right!  What'd she say?
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Look at this.
Yes.  But
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
What?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Er  No.
Todd, what's the matter?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
I'll come to the performance.
It's not going to help us!
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
Who asked any?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
You're going to have to get a new one.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
You people...rich people...
Seen a lot of islands?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't take orders at all.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey... Which way's aft?
Where are you going?
Check it out!
Yeah.
What?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
I got delayed. I --
You talk to him?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
She's in back.
No.
You know a guy named Merle?
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
No-o-o!
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I want to go home, Merle.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
What do you think about?
Hell no!
You think we'll ever come back?
Merle --
You're right... Okay, you're right.
More bullets in the gun?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
Watch it, shithead!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
What do you mean, no???
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Yeah.
No.
It's Merle, Sal.
No!
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
The fuck I did!!!
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Who is it?
Fuck you - fuck you.
I'm not on the force anymore.
You're crazy.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Just great.
Sir, your limo's here.
Sir---
Yes.
But Sergeant...
Bacon cheeseburgers.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
I'll be okay.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
What's it mean?
You never want to find out.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
You all right?
Seat's too high.
I'm going to be a policeman.
What's your name?
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
No, thank you -- what's your name?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Anybody can see that.
Howdy, Hank.
She couldn't be gone!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
The seventh day of April --
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
I'm through with you.
About what?
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Not long -- now.
Yes.
Who is it?
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
You know that, son.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Mary -- Jabez --
Of course not --
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Mr. Webster, I presume?
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
So, why didn't you come?
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
You...you're an American?
New York...
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
How do you know?
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
You'll be okay.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
Where you gonna go?
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Yeah... yeah!
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
You try calling the police?
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Call me whatever you want.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
He wanted to kill me!
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
The gun's right on your back...
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
You got kids?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
How did you know your son was involved?
Yeah.
Pure?
My body?  What for?
All right ... send them the guard.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
I'm here.
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Okay, when do I get them?
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I can't allow that, Sonny...
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Did Pop come down?
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Of course not ...
How much?
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Okay.
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
No. What's the big deal?
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
Fast and or furious.
You were good.
How you be?
Talk to me.
So?
How much?
What can you say?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
Good morning.
OK.  OK.
How come you're not at Sal's?
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
He's just being nice.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
Jade, you're late.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
I'll do.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Don't worry about it.
Sweet Dick Willie.
It's dug.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Quit bullshitting.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Later for you.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Just coolin'.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
I was going to buy a slice.
That's the dope.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
But I came here to learn about America.
In the new library there.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
HARRY!
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
I don't follow.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Will not.
Shut up!
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
I bet you want your head scratched.
But-
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
A blimp.
Who?
It's okay. I want the rush.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Special Needs class.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Well, something stinks.
That's my boyfriend.
Can you believe it?
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Have you got what I want?
We start our own class?
Wow, you are smart.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
We have just folded space from Ix...
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Do you know this my lady?
He knows.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Always.
Liet?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
... Many men have tried.
Did they try and fail?
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Eddie, how was I?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
Wow.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
It's a damn good role.
It takes me comfortable.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
But there's plenty of other parts.
You're a fuckin' mess.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Dolores, wait!
What other sixty-thousand?
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Hruphh...?
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Can I help you?
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
I got married last night.
Oh, it's you again.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Let's get married.
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
What's uncanny?
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
You think she really likes him?
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Sure.
Yeah?!
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Ed --
Yes?
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
No. It's a mess.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
He had girlfriends!
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Right.
Ha!
Okay ...
Oh yeah.
Where?
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
You would do this? You would actually --
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
I'm doing all right.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
No. What happened?
Hi.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
You brought the girl!
Good-bye, brother!
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
No -- keep it.
I was in jail.
No. Two times.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
How?
What does that have to do with... ?
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Having a problem with your eye there?
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
I did it.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Right now?
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
You're there.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
What?
People can see this.
I don't care.
Who put you up to this?
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
We talked.
So tell me about it.
In the morning.
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Of course... But how?
Give me one minute.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
At least not anymore.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Dogs got no reason to live.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
And?
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
No.
Yes, I do, sir.
Why?
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
What?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
She is Lana Turner.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Bud White's been here?
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
None.  Call it a hunch.
Officer White?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Yes.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
I don't know what that means.
No shit.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
How'd you have the manpower to--
Here?
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
No he won't.
What if--
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Do you see anything you like?
Is that good?
It's a little late for that.
I'll say.
Eight.  Size eight.
Thanks.
I think she'll like this very much.
That's my point.
Your stuff?
The robbery.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Somebody took my blender.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Something bad happened tonight.
I'm sorry.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
No.
Was that doctored-up, too?
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
It wasn't me.
Yes.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Does that hurt?
Good.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I was missing you.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Do you like fish?
Never.
Other than Brill.
Eat your fish.
You being audited?
How?
This conversation's over.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Robert--
What's his name?
Gentlemen--
I don't under--
Robert--
He's kidding.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Yes.
Bobby--
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
I need help.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Fuck you.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
What about the tapes?
The originals?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
What's your ETA?
Federal Express?
How'd you get in the building?
Which stall?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't want to go back.
That insults them.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
Don't.
When were you most happy?
This is - what is this?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
Don't do this.
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Good morning!
What?
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What's the matter with you?
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
May God make safety your companion.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Or was it Toronto?
So was my Patient.
No.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Ask him.
What if I told you he did this to me?
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
And you've forgotten yours.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Thought you'd never wake up!
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Right.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Candaules
Are you asleep?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
What do I do?
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
He can't even move.
Pardon me?
Certainly not.
I'll come with you.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
Through a window.
So he popped the pane?
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
You got a better idea?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Uh. I'm showing off.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
So what?
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Possibly.
Fine. What do I do?
It's one way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
Lose something?
I know it well.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Got it.
You bought this for me?
To us. To the Mask.
You're nervous again.
He wasn't.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Hmmm...44 long.
Well...What are we doing?
Peoples China Bank.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Charged.
Parachute.
That was a lifetime ago.
It was wrong to deceive you.
That's because you grew up rich.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
They drive so recklessly there.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
But--
--You're a cop.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Always in a rush.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
Which is--
Tina was a wonderful woman.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
You two make quite a couple.
You damn well thought wrong.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Yes it does.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
It's those files you asked for.
Fax these to this number, okay?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
There's more than one?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
Right.
Yeah.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
I don't even know how much money that is.
I can put them in a good school.
Any school you want.
Yup.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
All I have is hundreds.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
How many families we talking about here?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
They skipped that step.
What do you mean?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
And if you had to guess ...
So why would PG&E offer it?
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Morning!
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
What is that?
Who's the judge?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
Randy's mom said yes right away.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
You want my number?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
More than you need me.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Have you been logging on?
It'll be fine, yeah.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
You're moving away?  When?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Soon, Lord Vader.
He can do it.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Barks and growls at his boss.
... Like we're being watched.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Mine, mine.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
No.
We have no use for your kind.
The deflector shields are gone.
A tremor!
What are you talking about?
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
But I feel The Force flowing!
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Good God.
They're...pretending to dress.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
What, Lewis?
Primitive?
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
I tried...
Give it to me.
Oh Cuervo...
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
What's the little black box do?
A medical team will be standing by.
Plissken...?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Does he know how to activate it?
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Where are they?
Delgado?
No way.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Later.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Don't follow me.
Snake - what is it?
What the hell is this?
Well, I'll think it over.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
I'm looking for somebody.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
All of us?
Good day to you, sir.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
Perceval, you have returned!
Guenevere...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Why didn't he kill us?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Now you must pay me.
The oath. You didn't say--
To kill and be king, is that all?
What honey?
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What did the doctor say?
What is it?
I'm gonna miss you.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
So, what causes this?
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
No.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
You know how?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Hi Chris. Great party.
Goodnight Dims.
How's the girl?
Do you like films?
Withering Heights.
Another one. Had your lunch?
It would bring us together.
Did you do that?
Do it again.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Her heart.
What's this about?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
That's to bad.
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
...look down in pity...
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Are you a relative?
Are you comfortable Regan?
Who is it?
Give me the keys.
What's this?
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
We have some lotion.
Honey ...
They're falling out.
No.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Thanks.
Seeing anyone in particular?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
We gotta go, Jack.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
Says who?
Frank?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
We don't get a gig.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
A gust of wind killed him.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Come on, stand still.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
See anything?
Yeah.  Something.
Hey, Frank.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
We're gonna be here a week?
What?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You could've come.
The tenth's out.
Be reasonable, Jack.
What're you doing?
What's it for?
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
She asked for it.
So what'd you think?
No, no.  You boys are tired.
Just call me a cab.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
This is where the auditions were.
This is show business?
So run a little longer.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
When?
Do I look like I'm naked?
That!  You can't wear that!
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
Uh... good.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
I said I was sorry.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Maybe it's legit.
Virgins.
What'd she sing?
Got another song for us?
Some discussion.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Is that important?
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Gotta go.
Brought it.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
Frank works hard.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
He takes after our mother.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
So why's he do it?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
He called her.
Long story.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Coffee?
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
So how's the cat food business?
My days are not the old days, genius.
How do you know?
I guess it's getting serious.
Looks old.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
What's a prom?
Eddie.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
What did he do?
He's lying.
Where am I?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Perfect fit.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
A few blanks?  Like what?
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
We need to talk.
... I was dreaming ...
How come?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Which ear was it?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
What are you going to do, Castor?
What are you going to do!
Stay away from my family!
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
What happened?
Castor's escaped!
What happened?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
I'm just having some fun.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
Just following your example.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
What do you know about it?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
... That's great.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
What are you doing?
Kate Reynolds...
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Why Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
They did a pretty good job.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
We’re friends, aren’t we?
I don’t think so.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
Yes you do...
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
What're you talkin' about?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that...
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Hello!
She got those shoes...
Well...Annie for one.
You had a heart attack?
C’mon.
Say it, Jack...
You really are incredible...
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
I’m out of the doghouse?
Are you out of your mind?
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Damn...damn...damn...
Merry Christmas...
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
What?
He's not responsive --
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
And reverse the mutations --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
'Scuse me.
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
The Other Side got to him.
Right, sir.
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
Yes?
Difficult? He's impossible!
Doctor...
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
Such as?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
It's against my better Judgment...
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
A what?
Looks like quite a way to go...
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Sort of.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
No Jean, no money!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah.
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
No. No, ma'am.
Yah, but -
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Well... yah.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Yah!
Shep said 8:30.
Yah.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
No, see -
Hiya, Lou.
Yah?
Uh-huh.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Anyone else residing there?
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Yah?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
His wife?
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Copy.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
He's at Norstar.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
Hmm?
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
We need to talk.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
It's time for you to leave.
What are you talking about?
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don't know ...
There?
Feel anything?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Tyler...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
No, I...
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Call what off?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Promise you won't.
I said I promise!
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
Four in Milwaukee.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
This isn't possible...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
You took me to the house.
You... you can't be serious about this.
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Defuse the bomb?
One minute.
Why what?
What have you left for me?
What?
Maintenance.
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
What are you doing?!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
What list?
Please, what else could it mean?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Take a guess.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
What's going on here?
Kalarjian?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
I'm... really sorry.
That's why I was there last night.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
No! No! Don't!
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
That's what I'm doin'!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Wow!
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Again.
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
That's what I'm here for.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
What's this stuff on the rice?
I'm getting him out.
Can you handle the door gun?
I thought he was with you.
I know.  I go with you.
John.  My name is John.
You pathetic scum.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
You think they'll find any?
Take your time.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
There were treating me like a headcase.
Yeah.  Big time.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
But now it's free, right?
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Hello....congratulations.
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
You a friend of Parry's?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Remember. One chorus and out.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
It was a crime.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Which ones?
A list.
Free?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Please don't hurt me?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
I'm not married.
Can I take you to lunch?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
SAW WHO!!?
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
I don't like horror movies!
I don't drink coffee...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
No.
No, I...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Well, id'n that nice.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
No.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
What's your name?
No. How much do I owe you?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
You want me to hold the chicken.
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
Yeah... I guess so...
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
Maybe you better stay, then.
How long have you been staying here?
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Like what?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Tomorrow, then.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
That's right.
I'm fine.
That'll make you happy.
Four or five years.
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
What?
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
What kind of doggy is that?
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
There's some good things on it, though.
Miss Dupea.
Fine.
Why you have an attitude for?
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Nothin'.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
I buy them flowers.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Who gives!
Fa what?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Where you goin'?
Pitt.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
How does he look up close?
I think he's 18 or 17.
Like this?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Your friend must be misinformed.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
No idea.
Like when?
What, the heat here?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You gonna nail the chief?
I'm fine.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Has he?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
We can't talk about it here.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
Who?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I have this effect on lots of women.
You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Depends on the question.
Thanks for the great time.
What's wrong, Gail?
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Don't tell me I can't --
The door was unlocked.
What?
Who are you?
She moved out.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You were going to can me, right?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
No, I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
All your friends call you Jazz.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
So what about this watch?
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
How'd you get this from her?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
You okay?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Pretty smooth, huh?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Who cares?  I got a case.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
Jazz, we're talking here.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
That's cute.  You're funny.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Where do you want it?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Did they follow you?
I wasn't looking.
Who's this --
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
You're in show business.
What's he do?
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
The greaser with the blonde.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
Yeah.
Why not?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Same car.
Hiya, Jesus.
What is that old building?
What are you saying?
No, I don't.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
What I know is what I told you.
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I'm off.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
I'm serious.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Hey, bud.
About what?
What do you mean?
Uh, huh.
How's that?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
You call your son Little Chief?
What?
What's going on?
Fire.
Something happened, something...
Murdered?  Why?
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What are you talking about?
I don't know...  What about the other women?
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
How?
What?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
John, you there?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
What's wrong?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
John.  John, you all right?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
You used to be on the job?
I look familiar?
A hot shot, huh?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Going?  How do you mean?
Why don't we go take a swim?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Do you want a beer or not?
Come on down!
What's this?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
You promised you'd never ask me.
What're you doing?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
What it is?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Uh...yes.  But...
There...Ya happy?
But what if they try and scare us?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
What's goin' on?
Yes!
Eight times.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Anything else?
No, I --
Twenty.
Look, I don't want your money!
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
She's beautiful.
It was a community service.
Are you crazy?!
Don't do anything stupid.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
You don't know shit!
About Jessica.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
Have you seen Tamara?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
He bought you that?
That was truly excellent.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Dear Christ...
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
I'm staying.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
But Rennie...
We must abandon.
Very dangerous.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight. What's tonight?
What was it like?
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Shoot him.
How do you Eknow.
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
What about her?
She's dying.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
Why do you need a radio?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
First you tell me.
What else?
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I'd forgotten that.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
We must have been heroic.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Washed away.
Don't worry. It's a test.
Then they lost?
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
How come?
Yessiree, Bob.
Yes.
Yes, Peter.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
You've worked with Elliot?
A little drastic maybe?
Alla puttanesca.
No one's waiting.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
I haven't come to you.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
What can we do?
You're an ambitious man.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
A great deal.
Are you going to walk all the way?
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Jerome--?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
That's not the point.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Everybody goes there.
Will you be okay?
How the hell did you get here.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Where are you going?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
German, is that you?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
No bother.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
We were just looking.
I envy you, Jerome.
You'll be next.
So you didn't do it after all.
Let's walk.
My medication.  I left it back there.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
There's a problem, Lamar.
What are you doing?
The doctor will give you something.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
I'm in a hurry.
Assumed name... Houston.
Half a million.
At least you were outside.
Yeah.
Who's she?
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
When we had trouble before it was different.
You can't trust anything these days.
Are you hungry?
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We got this far.
Okay.
Oh, Jesus... how?
I'll be ready.
I don't know.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Thanks. Hope you do too.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Chicago.
I'm good at that.
Aren't we going a little hard?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
How?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Oh ay?
Well, he drove it into the river.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Where's he living these days?
Yes.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Sid Fletcher.
Yes, while he was here.
Was he?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Have another?
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Where would I find him?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Now just a minute...
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
No.
Do you want breakfast?
Are you tired?
Do us a favour?
Not much.
Is he?
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
We've got to take you back to London.
What's that?
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
And now...
I...
It's not.
And it's not right to the customers.
Eh...?
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
Yes.
Just the act.
That's what I...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Someone should hurt them.
How many leads have we got?
As a robbery.
No.  Not actually.
Is that what I said?
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
And why is that?
Huh?
Everything I...you know...
He said he filed...
A waste of time?  Why?
Did the leads come in yet?
You...
That's great.
Go to lunch, George.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Would you come in here, please?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Shelly, you blew the last...
...do you want to go downtown...?
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Murray said...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
Of what?
Not lately you can't...
What happened?
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Yes, I am.
What are you talking about?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Was it?
I...
Abso...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Dave...
When?
Just now.
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Twelve-fifteen.
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
I'm sorry...?
Rick...
Me.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
I'm not.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
She wants her money back.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
This.
What are the police doing?
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Fuck the Machine.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Guess who?
Why not?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
They got, listen to me...
Yes.
Where are you going?
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
John...
Do you like them?
Just a few days.
To do business.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
I'm not hungry.
What position did you occupy?
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Tom is right.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
What's that?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Chi?
That's off now.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Kay... Kay...
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
Where's my wife?
What do you mean gone?
Why didn't someone tell me!
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
Wait... there's something else.
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
What's up?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
I'm going to the market.
Where?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
Why too late?
Kay, I told you...
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Are you Klingman?
Right here.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
No, I meant lose his family.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Very impressive.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
That is a complete falsehood.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
We'll try.
He don't want to talk?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
He supports me.
What's this?
Thanks, doll.
Just thinking out loud.
This looks corny.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
I didn't mean to...
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
You're sure of that?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Good morning.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
What?  Oh yes.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Football in college.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
Why not?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
I'm game.  Sure.
Who's that?
No.  The girl.
Is that really her?
Let's get out of this funk hole
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
That only leaves the rest.
Do I have any other choice?
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
What won't do?
By the way, I like the Renoir.
Thank you.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
She is horrible.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
This is the studio where I paint.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
You're serious.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
How's the leg?
Yeah -- ?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
You have my word...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I know you.
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Double-meaning intended, right?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
How's it going -- ?
Dignity...
There's no one left ...
That's a good one, Donny...
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
You all right -- ?
So what are you gonna do?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Price of doing business...
Having fun, Kip?
What?
You boost her -- ?
What for -- ?
Now what -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
And here I am...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
You mentioned that in your letters
So, you seeing anybody?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
This time it's for real?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
You remember Junie?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Okay, then... Otto?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
My bag. My bag.
What are you talking about?
We've got to help each other.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
With what?
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
You ready?
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
Are you okay? What happened?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
But, Paulie, please.
Suck my cock!
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
It's a way outta here.
You don't know that.
What class?
You caught that, huh?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Did she get my Double Burger?
Retainer...
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
Codebreaking.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
--Half-red, half-black--
Shall we start the, uh...
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
What are you smiling at?
Hey, how you doin'?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Good to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
Hello.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Why me?
Tom.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--I'm not angry at you--
He won't be a failure!
Sean...
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
What places?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Yes, I do.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
Haven't called her.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Yeah.
Do you think you're alone?
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Don't fuck with me.
What?
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
No.
Yes you were.
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
You know, nothing special.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Just for fun?
Like me?
Come with me to California.
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
What am I scared of?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
I'd come back--
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
I didn't see nothin'.
Two.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Got a warrant?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
She's settlin'.
What you figger to do?
Thought you was in jail.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
But we can still do it, honey.
Sure do.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
How about a lift, mister?
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
What's the matter, Grampa?
But will it--hurt the baby?
Anybody ask anything?
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
Know where we're a-goin'?
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Ya say we're acrost?
No.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
I wisht it was day.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
What's these?
Morning.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
What do you do?
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Insane.
I just play my own collection.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Is it something you've done?
You never could have kept this from me.
Come on.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
How was your day, today, sir?
Up on the right.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello Martin. How have you been?
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Well?
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
This?
They're not happy, sir.
And they want me to make up for it.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
I bought a new rug.
What's a revival tent?
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.
To shoot you. Correct.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
Why not?
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Yeah.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I don't care.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
That's not true.
Good.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
Doing what?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
How are you feeling about work?
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
I don't understa-
Where to?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Where does this go, Diane?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
She's an editor.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
I thought your mom's coming up?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Don't be such a baby!
You just showing off for her!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
How long were you married?
You ever miss it?
Well, that'll happen.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
What's that?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Very impressive.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Did you talk to him?
Up all night again, huh?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Are you challenging me?
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
You're not gonna win.
I know, I know who wrote it.
Oh, wow, she's great.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Hello?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
A hacker planted the virus.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
You guys always look great.
About what?
Four plus Myers.
Night Doc.
Who you calling?
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Come on Rachel.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Rachel!
You don't believe that do you?
Why don't you go make some coffee.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't come on too strong.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Hell of a night.
When he makes that call.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
You're going to be late!
Saving the treats for Bob?
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Annie, was that you?
He can still watch.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What's this big, big news?
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
I don't know.
I don't want to.
Go get me a beer.
You all right?
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Can we watch the monster movies?
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
What about the bogyman?
No...
Right.
What is it, Laurie?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
PROBABLY going.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Pull up to the entrance!
...any sister talk?
You want to see some?
Well, I live downtown.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Oh!
Elliot!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
I thought you weren't coming.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Lee...
I know.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
But, you got four children!
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
No!
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Why should I be afraid?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Mmm...
Hmm?
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, yes, you have!
I'm sorry.
N-n-no, not that.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Yeah.
Ohh!
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Frederick didn't come with her.
It's, uh, you never know--
Yeah, can you believe it?
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
You're too demanding.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
No!
I recall you.
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah?
Have you?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Really?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Just a few minutes ago.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Uh-huh.
Aren't you glad to see me?
I can't think.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
...<u>please</u>...
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
...you...
...why?
You want to get married...?
How you doin?
That's right.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Hold up a minute...
Not with any certainty we...
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
I've never heard that he...
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
I won't take much of his time.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What reaction?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Mmm...
Sir:
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
...standard issue...
That could be.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
I said sometime it gets so...
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
My husband brought it to me from America.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
...Franklin.
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
...who say...?
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what...?
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
Fine, thank you, but
Then we cannot go.
....because we don't have any mmm...
I know where he is.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
When?
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Go stand by the flagpole.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Talia, you're a wonderful person...

Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Because you're an idiot.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
I said I was sorry.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
Chick-en.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Did to.
Did to.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
The bomb, asshole!
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
He's the manager!
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
is very angry.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Him.
That.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
John has fallen in love with me!
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Mummy!
Your insight is enlightening.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Of course, yes.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
What?
I have my connections
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Have we met?
I've been in here before.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
What's wrong, Trev?
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Never to put you in my will.
Really, why's that?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Morgue...?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
I don't work here.
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
It was you!  I thought I heard...
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Mister LaPlante...
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Were you in it?  In the war?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Uh, no.
Uh, er... I...
Yes.
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
Unprofessional.
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Okay.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Mommy!
C'mon, kids, let's go.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
Lieutenant?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What do you think?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
She was a good woman.
You sure?
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
This cannot be.
The past?
Sometimes.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
Are you a cop?
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
If it's good advice.
No.
Yes.
That makes you uncomfortable?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
I've seen it.
Be careful, Conner.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
Don't leave us, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Jen?  Are you all right?
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Jesus.  What is this?
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
Not if they're looking at something else.
You with the cops?
I'll give you these people.
That you, Talley?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
The cops are comin'!
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
What do you mean?
I need to work out some stuff.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Just one question.  Please.
He didn't say.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Louise?
Louise?
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Who is it?
Did you find the disks?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Who are you?
Marlon and Al....
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
What do you mean by that?
Excuse me?
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You want to pay me?
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
What did they say?
Satellites?
Whiskey?
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Mr. Manager.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
What do you want?
What?
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
How do you know?
The third floor are low class rooms.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
What?
You could have asked for a favor.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
What for Paul.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
In Ruhengeri?
I want to know.
I will not leave without the twins.
I have to stay.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Twelve are dead.
The staff and guests! How many?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Can I help you?
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
-- what was he doing here?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
What are you looking for?
Don't think it's even an issue.
Where did it go?
You okay?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
What are you talking about?
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
Vannacutt!!
What're you talking about?
I'll take my chances.
-- it wasn't me.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Believe me, we need to.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Please.....anyone....help me?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --
We don't have proof of that.
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
Where does this amulet come from?
By killing them?
I don't understand.
Maybe it was Colleen...
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Are we leaving mommy?
She's down.  Help her...
Sure.  Did you see the others?
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
What?
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
The rain is letting up.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
I'll do it!
How have you ... ?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
What ... What ... ?
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
The security's actually not that severe.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Cameras?
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
Let's just forget it, I mean...
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Anna, what are you trying to say...
A little petting is not the issue!
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Yes.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
Employer?  The president?
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
The Shazzammeter!
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
-- and she's dynamite!
Oh, no, really, I --
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Smitty.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
I know that, Amy.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Your i --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Now, Amy --
I'm sure you do.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
...It is?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
Geez, I --
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Not that way! Through the door!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Yellowstone.
...adenoids.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
I am not a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
Why did you come in here?
I love Fort Holland.
She was beautiful.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
Why?
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
I wasn't star--
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
So early?
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Yeah, that one.
I have no idea.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Elena.
Hi dad.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.
So how's school treating you?
Here.
What are you talking about?
Fascist!
What you been up to?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
A key party?
Thank you Janey.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
With Mikey?
Mikey Williams?
Mom. Are you ok?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
It's not a bother.
They say you never forget.
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
See ya.
Flame on, asshole.
Do what?
What do you mean?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
My what?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Truly? Do speak.
Who said so?
Geometry?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Did you tell Sandy?
I don't know.
When worlds collide.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Well, you can...
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Vodka?
Do it again.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
No.
Are you sure about that?
That's right.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
No way.
One of your cases?
Huh?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
After that she left the party to go to him.
Ran like hell to go to him...
That's a long time.
Who?
Told you I could write an ending.
Then so was mine...
This an accident, Walter?
Monstrous.
So you have the answers...
I was waiting for you...
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
Are these not the answers you came for?
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
I can't save her.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
No.
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Not you my dear.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
You both did it?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
Don't mock, Claudia...
How do I look?
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
What danger?
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
You really want to be with them?
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
I can't.
Paris? You came from Paris?
I don't pretend to know.
Why do you do this Lestat?
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Lestat!
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
It's only a siren...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
You're not lying to me, are you?
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.
Shall we go on?
What about a radio?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Hello? Hello?
Karaoke -- perfect.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Be careful, Julie.
Julie?
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
I don't know.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
How's Julie?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
What's going on?
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
You're just talking nonsense.
They were gore before I came here.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then —- I'll not die —— I'll watch -— they shall not hurt you.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Miss Wollsten!
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Thea, what's wrong?
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
Then foreclose!
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Carter –– bank examiner.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
You have no car.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
What?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Well?
Today, over at the house.
There it is, good as new.
I know –– I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
It will?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Big –– see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
No charge.
Came back three days ago.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
I know, but . . .
Well, what do you know –– wife.
All of it?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Pop!
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Have you notified the police?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
What'd you wish, George?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up your mind?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Oh, George, George!
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
You coming up on him?
Chief....
Chief?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Mike's out there.
Untie that rope.
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Pop....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Me neither.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
You don't make enough.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Can't you tell?
Fooling around?
Door's locked.
It was bad, wasn't it.
What'd I say?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Bullshit.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Dad!  Dad!
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Tina Wilcox.
But first, a little juice....
Take me.
I want to go with you!
Michael....
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
It hasn't adjusted.
He's going with you, Doctor.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
My imagination isn't that good.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
They're coming with us?
How the hell did it get in here?
You're going down there again?
Fine piece of engineering.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
They said you'd be here.
What's up?
No, we'll go through here.
Hydrophobia...
I can't take water, Kathryn.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
I am.  You're not.
I told you, something's upset them.
You look like an orange worm.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
We're taking that shark alive!
Let's hope he knows that.
Afraid I can't do that.
Should be coming out of it soon.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
He's a young one.
Sure.
Sure.  No problem.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
Herpes?
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Now what's this do?
It's okay, Sean.
Hold still, damn it!
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Yeah, poor bastard.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
The world's southern most reaches.
Reach for the limit I always say.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Sure.
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Can I make sandwiches...?
No....
I have work....
What's wrong?  What happened?
You knew...?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
The fish.  Check it....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
I'll be in to read you a story.
Nothing out of the ordinary....
I'm not going to quit now....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
You're not a pain in the ass....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I have to get this finished.
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
Can you just go off...?
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
A big one....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
Won't you get in trouble...?
Hurry!
Yes I can....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
They put bombs on dolphins....
What happened to Clarence and...?
When we got the grant....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
Who?
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
'Snuck up on me....'
You told me what?
Who grows more beautiful....
I'm training to....
When he has a pillow over his head....
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
What does that mean?
Where is everyone?
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
Well .. I didn't know that ..
I'm asking it.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Where's your watch?
You ain't going in alone?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Have you been here long?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.
I know.
You know? How do you know?
Why can't I stay with you?
You do?
You find something curious in that?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
You think John would like it?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
I just heard.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
We are?
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
What about medical?
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
He's coming over.
That's the girl I love.
Good.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Oh, thank you.
Mmm.  Hmm.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
I understand your anxiety.
You're telling me to dance.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
No, you're --
I'm sorry I asked.
Gorgeous.
To the pools?
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
You gonna get that --
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
One-two-three, swing.
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
Can you be quiet?
Sorry.
You hate to swim.
What did you say?
Young adult.
Eric! Are you here?
Well what?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
That does sound lucky.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
I want to be an astronaut.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
Hmmm.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You are an academic.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
What?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
I have to find Kelly!
Something's wrong.
Why did you come here?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
The movement!
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Not just every six weeks.
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
Are you sure?
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
- - shut up.
Why not?
Yeah.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
You got me.
Go, go, go, jump!
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Kids get scared.
I didn't say you were scared.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Tim!  Lex!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
They don't bother me.
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
Mister Biller?
I think we're lost.
He... he's here...
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
What happened?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
He's fucking nuts.
Doesnit sleep?
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
How's that possible?
We're down to seven minutes.
You work in the insurance department?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Another one?
Then its authority is in doubt.
No, I left it in his office.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
What?
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
I don't know.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
That's <u>mad</u>.
... A piece of paper ...
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
It's gone out so quickly?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
Women are all you have on your mind!
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Why?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Sure dear, yes.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yes?
Guess!
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
I said yes, I see.
No, I'm look --
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
-- OK?
He never told me.
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
I don't see anything, do you?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
The same as Jane McKenna.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
How can you do it to yourself?
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
Spangler says we have a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Right back at the start, right?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
I called Trina.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
Well there's a couple --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
No.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Are you closing the case?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
Uh huh...
I'm sorry.
Salisbury steak.
Is mom ever coming back?
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
See you in the morning light.
Like a principal?
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Sustained.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Yes, what?
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
Kramer--
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Three months.  How can you tell?
I know....I know.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
What if I fight it?
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
How the hell are you going to do that?
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Thelma, if I die--
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
All quiet?
Kham, Holiness.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Can I do anything I want?
I do, now.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Goodbye, Kundun.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Will we be in this war?
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
What is the size of our army, now?
Has anyone died?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Where is that?
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
They will take Lhasa next.
I leave tomorrow.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
Things change, Kundun.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
But, I have no experience.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Thank you.
I might get a shot.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Then do it!!
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
And again.  How would you get him on land?
Where?  Where?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
He was an Indo-pacific.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Never been to Maine before?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
Okay.  We're up at six.
Good.
Excuse me?
Who taught you be be a nurse?
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Calm down.
What?
Well...
You think?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
Did he say anything?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Yes.
You have a thing against museums?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Hank?
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
Should I?
I had a great time last night. Again.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
A jerk.
A tooth?
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Part of our research--
It has nothing to do with--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Wild guess.
Liar?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
I don't know! Get me out!!
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I understand.
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
That wasn't me.
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Who's the subject?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Miggs has been murdered.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Sewing...
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
Did you ever work with her?
Sometimes you do.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
All flayed...?
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
I didn't.
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Go, Doctor.
The death of my father.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Why so briefly?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
I heard a strange sound...
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
My God, you've grown up.
Can we rest soon?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
You still have an aversion to the water?
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Will you consider that?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
I see...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
Yes. Go ahead.
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
No.
Who were these people?
Where do we go from here?
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Got a reason to stay.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Yes, sir.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
For Munro children?
Yes.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Their arms?
Qui vive?
Why Sixpack?
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Be careful with it.
No!
How do you know it was Williams?
I need more light on that, Four.
Oh, God, she's out there...
What's your air reading?
Made your million, yet?
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
You read Russian?
It...almost got you.
What's going on?
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
How far away is she?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What's wrong, did you miss me?
It's hit us all hard!
Bacon, see what we got.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
How long has he been in there, son?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
You what? What are you on about?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Right as rain.
You and me, Tom.
Tom?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
I want your bar.
I can't help you, Plank.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
What's left over?'
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Oh, come on, Amado--
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Because it's a job?
No, sir. Not at all.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
And you and Private Graves--
We're not running a dating service here.
I'm feeling okay--
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Colt Peacemaker.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
I'm not picking it up.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Suppose not.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
Where'd he get all this?
He a Black man or an Indian?
The Trail of Tears.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Tanks, huh?
My father.
You own this place?
This place is a gold mine.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Hey, Mikey--
Mikey--
We been through this before--
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
Substance abuse?
Black Seminoles?
That's where he fell.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Right.
And people make their choice--
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
I thought you were married!
This girl has a child?
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
--Santiago.
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
And Buddy was one of them.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
The Perdido thing?
There was a mandate in the last election--
Your mother's family is Spanish?
The Sheriff.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
And when my father was Sheriff?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Yeah?
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Three months.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
People liked him.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
I mean what did we know about anything?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
So what are we gonna do about this?
Like your story is over.
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
The shooter local?
Yeah.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
He's gonna find out.
They go together.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Nix?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Why did you wait so long?
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Yes...
He's with us...
And are you afraid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
He's a secretive man.
Does that mean...?
I can be very persuasive.
How did it go today?
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Harry?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Go away.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Was that Swann's idea?
I want to see Swann face to face.
Him too.
What?
Not much.
Where'd you learn that?
At birth.  I don't know you --
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
For what?
Have you been in?
Or murdered, like Nix.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
They got here before us.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
I don't know.
I got to go.  I'm late.
A couple of weeks.
Is he the Puritan?
You don't think I've got it to give?
And?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
No!
Yeah, they told me.
What about you? Why are you here?
What do you do?
Oh, what do you do with that?
Oh, hi.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Of course.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
How old is she?
Nice one.
Working.
That's what you said the other night.
Charlotte?
You're leaving right now?
Yes?
Ok, well... I love you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Like Japanese food.
Hello?
Do you want to- 
Yeah.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Hmmm.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
What a...jerk!
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
My secretary?
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
What is it?
Something he said, just before...
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
May I help you?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
And the point is?
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
What do you mean?
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
She told me she killed them.
Taste this.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
So what do I do?
Whatever.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
Thanks.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Why not?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No one's forcing her.
Oh, great.
You do.
What?
Hey, munchkin.
Just wanted to say good game.
Well, what do you know.
Just like that?
Just not my type, I guess.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
I don't know.  A lot.
I don't like flowers.
What's that?
With a jacked-up attitude.
None of your business.
Clothes.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
You're not stupid.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Yup.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
Then why are you so upset?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
What's that, not great?
Nona, please.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Quincy, please...
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
...what the fuck is this...?
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
I don't wanna talk to you.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
You just move in here?
Yeah.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
-- do you wanna cup?
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Just Jim.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Please, yes.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Billingsley's?
So you've done it --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
What?
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
Just say no.
Yes.
-- can I get you?
Where's Richard and Julia?
It's upstairs.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
I'm almost done.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Doc it's Janet.
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
This sounds threatening.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
Braces.
Yes.
I don't know.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
No.
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Graduation?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Let's talk about --
-- let's talk more about your background --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Mm. Hm.
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
...ok...
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
I AM CALM.
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
...you know...
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
I won't.
I need you to get me Paula --
I don't think I want that.
How do we do this, then?
I don't.
I love you so much.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
I really don't know.
But you can't say....
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
I'm Bob.
No.
What's MOW?
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Hang up the phone.
Yeah.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
I need this one.
Be ready at two --
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Alright.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
And you were not hurt?
What had you to do with this, Mother?
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
But -- what is he doing?
Aramis, this will never --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Everyone back.
D'Artagnan, unready?
You are right.  But it is a trap.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
D'Artagnan!
Where are you going?
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Whose rooms are those?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
It's Marvosa -
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Bullshit...
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
And he took a swing at you?
Did he harm the girl?
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Who is it?
Where is he?!!
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
Oh man...what happened?
I've got a better idea...
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
I knew I could count on you.
What about him?
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Not the Bible?
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
No.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
See? You do know something about him.
Who did he ask for?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Will...?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Yes, are you okay...?!
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Not me.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Yes?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
No.
I want to see Lecktor now.
Hi, Linda. ..
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
I remember.
Do you remember what you said?
Then why?
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Is Crawford going with you?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
What's this Mama shit?
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
No.
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
And?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
What disadvantage?
That's interesting.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
May I keep the file?
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Sitcom...?
Hi George!
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
How long would they let me sleep?
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
What, you don't think I can beat him?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Five.
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Have you told your family?
Then your father's a wimp.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
That was a really hot house!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Sure...
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
It's my name.
If you get caught using that --
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
... yes.
Why you're here?
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Are they any agent?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Do you still want to meet?
For what?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
And she knows what?  Everything?
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Got it.
That vase.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
What's funny?
Hello, Neo.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
What is this thing?
That's different.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Neo, how did you do that?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
No.
Where is it?
Holy shit!
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
We need an exit!
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
That means it's good.
Well, we want good stuff.
Uh...can we give you a check?
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
And say what?
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
You got some mouth!
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't be smart.
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Don't you move!!!
That bad, huh?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
Nope...
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Hostess?
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Take a drink!
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
A paper on that one too?
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Scumbag--
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
That was 'Joe'.
Daddy!
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
I know you do, darling.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
That you've been to Susan?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
I thought you were buying my company.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
I didn't say.
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Yes.
Yes.
What an odd pairing.
It's going to be great --
Shall we adjourn?
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Well, I guess he's found one.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
What you then?
Not time yet.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Rass!
No.  Nothing.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Oh yes, I do.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
Joe --
And I'll be a visitor.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Yes...
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
...No.
I loved it.
For how long?
I love you in an evening gown.
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
I love you now, I'll love you always --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
Good morning, Bill.
Joe --?
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
Can you keep a secret?
No.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Okay.
That's okay.
This universe?
And I don't give a shit.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Which is what?
I am not a dream.
That's me.
Are you giving me orders?
Please.  Talk to me --
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
'The one' to do what?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
This one.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Good morning, Dad.
Drew's aboard?
I hope so.
Don't get carried away.
Uh oh --
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
We've met.
It'll come back, Daddy.
I don't understand.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
I'm sorry --
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
How'd you know?
21.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
66.
Slam it?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
Hiya.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Who did this to you?
You think you can bargain with me?!
Deals?
Sleep okay?
So I just take your word?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Don't talk about my wife.
On the house.
You're the memory guy?
How do you know about me?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
How can you read that again?
Yup?
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Things change.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
We've got to get him out of here.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
She couldn't.
I didn't sell -
Why?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
No. You took them out.						  *
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
So...?
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
You do.
When?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Where's she now?
Like...?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Yeah.
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
No.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Hey, fuck him.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Hello?
What's your Miami PD badge number?
So what do you want?
What are you talking about?
Have faith.
Where's Riccardo?
Okay...see you soon.
And...?
Conveyance?
You set this up!
Then what were we talking to you for?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Men, they mostly faggots.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
I can tell, can't you?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
I'm going to Florida.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for anything.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Instant V-goddam-D.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You really want to do business?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Getchmis olsun
Getchmis...?
'Figgers.
Tunnel?
You got that, shit face? Asina...
It's there!
Who?
To what?
Dad...I'm...
Where'd you get that limp?
I'll pay extra
Where are the minefields?
Would you recognize him again?
Stupid.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Just Erich.
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
And?
Yeah.
What?
Cut his fucking throat.
You know where it is?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Never was anybody like you...
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Work, work, work, that's all do
What'd the Prosecutor say?
What's your name?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Oh, man, there you go again.
Its muscles are locked.
Is there a switch?
He's special.
But the power...
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
It's me. Can you hear me?
It's no use! They know we're in here!
What's this?
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
Sure.
How long...?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
You want to read it?
Nothing.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
I DIDN'T...
Then who did?
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
The what?
What?
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
I'm glad you like it.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
They're hauling Misery into court.
Yes.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Great.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
I thought you were over it.
All done, chief..
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
Not much luggage.
How do you that.
Your room.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Ninety-three point four million.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
What are you doing here?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
They've got a book for this?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
And six billion in the world.
I don't.
And that's the only reason?
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
-- his left jacket pocket.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.  Should I?
Why did you phrase it like that?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
Come on!
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
What?
Where were you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire...Hey...
Go ahead.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
No sir.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
What are we downloading?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Merci.
Higher.  Higher.
I thought I was going to see Max.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
He's our guy.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Whatís the problem.
Cosmo?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Ti amo.
Again?
The guy died.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
He did?
It's temporary.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
I'm making you a steak.
How'd he die?
Why?
Why what?
Why you talking to me?
What are you doing!
Because I have no Luck!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
I can't do that!
I'm telling you you can't.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
That was just so... awful!
I'm here!
Yeah.
Let me go home.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
How near is she to death?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
How was your plane ride?
How's the mother?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
No more he's not.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Do you love him, Loretta?
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
Don't fight.
Don't fight.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
It's late.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
I don't know.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Yes?
Sure!
What happened?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
That woman was a student of yours?
Then why are you eating alone?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
You were a tiger last night.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
How do you know she is a witch?
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Halt!  Who goes there?
Yes!
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Well, who is your lord?
Oh!
All right!  What do you want?
A what?
None shall pass.
Well, what's that then?
Hello.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Are you sure he's got one?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
It is the rabbit.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
Yes.
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
Blue.
To seek the Grail!
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Gosh - Is he all right?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
But, Mother ...
Father, lad.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
If we ... er ... 
We're coming with you.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Why?
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Hurry!
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
The good-looking one.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
What are you doing?!
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
It's what the maids are for.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Yeah.
Gesture?
It's so infernally cold in here.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
I'm sorry?
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
That can wait till the weekend.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
I wouldn't know.
Why?
The greasy pole.
In time, she will.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
What is it, John?  John?
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I'm breaking no promises!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
What can we do?
Mrs Brown.
Yes.
I have no idea.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
What's the question mark?
Maybe he's not dead.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
So where is he?
I have to talk to you.
No, in person.  Now.
Where do we go?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
SLIP-STREAM.
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
You're not coming, Alex.
One.  In case...
What is it?
Yes...
What did he do to you?
You have no time.  What is your question?
I'm thinking!
So what do you think?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Howdy!
Sure.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
There was an accident. I came here.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Yes, there was.
What's wrong?
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
Do you know them?!
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
You're so easy.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Palmdale.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
Why should I ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
I don't get it.
Do you know where you're going ?
What was that ?
Just stop it. End it here.
It's fine thanks.
That's not to tough.
Is it over ?
Don't eat at the console.
When will that be ?
Of course.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
<<belch>>
Do you want to go out with me ?
Really ? On a date ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
What ?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Do what?
Okay, no problem.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
Was it a nice funeral?
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Maybe he's wet?
Thanks.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?

Special effects?
Do you have any pictures if her?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Come on in!
Is it okay if I drink this?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Hello.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Hi there...can I help you?
Don't wake up Vada.
You're over reacting!
MOM!
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I'd never do that.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
...I dropped it.
You mean,  this ring?
Good. I mean...
Like what?
No?
Wow!
You're a good man Nicholas.
Committed.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
A secret, I like that.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
I think this place is just fine.
You know how I feel about you.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Shelly?
Beidermeyer?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Ex...ex, ex...
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
Stiffs??
You don't like it?
What do you mean??
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Kinda like men.
Oh, how do you mean?
Are you mad at me?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Did she ever see Vada?
I haven't danced in.....
Kiss me.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad?
She likes to play bingo.
Really?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Thirty five dollars.
What do you get for that?
I paid the money.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
I wrote a poem too.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Shut your big fat mouth!
He won't give it to me.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
You have no personality.
What do you think it's like?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
But I have my clothes on!
Come on, let's go.
Like they do on TV?
No.
Seeya tomorrow.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
You think...
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
We'll never be the same.
You have a real philosophy of life.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
I was devastated.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Elmer's Glue?
Major.  Dish.
Excuse me?
Let me rephrase that...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
About Michael's job.
He'll see right through it.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
It doesn't say th...
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
Well, somet...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Should I whistle down a cab?
I never eat when I'm serene.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Will she like it?
This is her family and her fault.
I asked you...
Thank God you were here.
What's up?
Well, if that's the way you f...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
I won first prize.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
What did you say your name was?
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
What do you really want?
You bet.
His Word.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
Okay, then we'll see you there.
D.C.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
No.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Yes, it is --
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
You sound different. Is that really you?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Hello. John Triplette.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
You sure do it loud.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
By all means.
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Do you have a back up.
Whose ratings were higher?
What I'd like to do---
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Tell me about the purity.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
No.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Yes.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
What the hell happened to you?
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
I see.
Ya know, I was.
Really?
What are we talking about?
I can't do that. Five guys.
Don't call my men assholes.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Give her a beer.
Boy - you hear me?!
'You Duff Anderson?
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
What d'you want?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Guess I don't.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Been over to the other mill?
What d'you expect?
I like a place with lots of life.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
No, on the porch.
'Been up north?
I didn't know you had one.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
How old is your boy?
Thank you.
I can see why.
Uh-huh. Why?
Huh?
You jivin' me?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Yeah!
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
'Round town.
Like what?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
What 'you signifyin'?
That's right.
'You Will Anderson?
Sure.
That's right.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
I don't have a girl.
You're pleasant tonight.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Where the hell have you been?
We got problems topside.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Want to fucking answer them?
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Why should I want to meet him.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
How long have I been out?
That's not going to help.
What the fuck... are you serious?
I'm going in.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
What's that?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
– uhh, must have forgotten-
What?
Oh, man! Who told?
Yeah.
Forget it.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Anita!
Senorita Josie.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
You need my help?
Wings?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Oh my god.
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Oh I don't think so.
Yoooooow.
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
No, I'm alone.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Josie, you look Rufus.
I know.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Taste it.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Why not?
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
Wanna join your little friend?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
What the hell are you talking about?
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Who?
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
Any ghosts in here?
Anything?
Disappointed?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Whoa!
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
Jess?
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
Okay, I guess.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
We're going up to bed now.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Mom?
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Research.
What's happening?
Do you still...see each other?
You did it the other night.
That was different.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Anything?
Oh God.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
So do I.
Try me.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Films mainly.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Are you busy tonight?
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
That's fine.
Whoopsidaisies.
So who left who?
She saw through me.
I'm sorry.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
No.  What's that?
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Sorry about that.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Anna Scott?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes -- sort of...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Hello, Bernie.
Blimey.  What's that?
Ahm... room service.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Any more announcements?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Bad news.
The one down your trousers.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Y-y-y-yes...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Go on...
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Thank you, ma'am.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Please see to Mister Bromden.
H-H-Hearts.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
A bus?
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
In ya go...
M-M-M-Mack?
Say... God Bless America!
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
There they are!
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Lobotomy!
With your own two hands?
Twenty-five dollars.
What for?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I said out!
Don't you have any clubs?
Big king, too bad...
Hear what?
What's this?
Right!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Time out!
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
'Kay!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
A dime.
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
He's in charge.
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Yeah!
I'm sure you will.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
At this hour?
What's that?
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
No, she wasn't my sister.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
You're sure...
You're sure...
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
We'll KNOW.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
You didn't answer my question.
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Tell me.
Oh.  That's nice.
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Hi.  Are you... busy?
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
You're Damon Bradley?
Well, not exactly...
Well, to-- new friends.
Excuse me?
Is everything okay?
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
No.  He's never asked me.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Thank you so much.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
He's heeeeeerrre...
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
Amazing...
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
I came after the woman I love.
Thanks.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I wish I knew.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Maybe he gave them an argument.
That's right... .
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
I could have been better!
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
See! You don't understand!
I can get home all right from here—
What?
How do you like that one?
How about another one?
What made you want to be a fighter?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
Edie!
Terry, what's wrong?
What I did to Joey.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Terry, no, no... .
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
What do you want from me, Father.
D 'n D?
What do you think?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'm just resting my feet.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
You'll work.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
You was a Golden Warrior.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
I'm not sure...
What do you mean?
Those creatures..!
The ropes are coming loose.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
She was?
Well?
There are others.
Is there time?
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
I want to speak with you, please.
Yes.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Till they got busted.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
Forty-five minutes.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Yes, she did.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
I get that feeling, yeah.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Call and tell you.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
Ironic, isn't it?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Good luck, Richard.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Is that right?
Nothing.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Think I could have them back?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Take your sunglasses off.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
Weren't you expecting us?
How many?
You know who they are?
Thanks for your help.
Of course not.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Foley?  That you?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Take the next exit.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Can I do what?
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Hi, Ray.
You not with probation, one of those?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
He's still married though, huh?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
You used to like it.
I really gotta go.
He doesn't even look like that.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
He waved to you?
Out for the evening?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
I found a rubber.
You mean hiding them?
Nervous?
You liked that?
Sir, I --
A m-missionary?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Land of the free...
Didn't you say test the limits?
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
Waitress!  Four beers!
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
You were more like brothers.
Sorry.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
How'd you get this?
Win?
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
What if the Japanese did invade?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Leapin' Jesus!
Hello, Lilla!
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
All right. What's the scoop?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Why wait?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
He's trying.
You really love me, don't you?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I just can't trust you anymore.
That's real big of you.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
I've got to go now.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Terry! Slow down.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
What?
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Quiet today?
Oh no!
Jack, I was just trying to help.
I'm excused.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Who was that man?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
What do you mean?
What does Charlie think about that?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
I remember that dress.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Dancing with you.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Okay. I promise.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Did you break up with Charlie?
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What's wrong?!
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Who was that?
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You want me to help?
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
What's wrong with your face?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Thanks, you guys.
It could be parasites, an infection...
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
I buy that.
What's her name?
One more thing, Your Honor...
You survived your first gay party intact.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
We proceed, representing your estate.
What impressed you about him?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
What kind of movies do they show there?
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Where's Dad?
What did you say?
Objection!
We're going to draw blood.
A homosexual encounter.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
You're the asshole, buddy.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Bottle-count.
Bring the light!
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
How many you see?
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
You'd die for them?
Not sure. Ten?
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
What, switch what?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Better keep moving....
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
Smoke screen for what?
For your own fear.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
This does not help us, Johns.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
You know who Muhammad was?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Frightening thought.
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
We crossed our own tracks.
A toast to whatever he just said.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Think about that reward, Johns.
Well, what's it look like now?
Such as.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Take it.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
It's probably wrong --
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Which direction?
Will he live?
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
All right --
No cigar.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
He wouldn't leave her.
Gorilla hunters ...
One is in a museum!
Read it yourself.
No.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
What is your proposal?
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Of course.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Taylor, please --
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Like you, I find it difficult.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Sarge?
Yeah?
You lame Taylor?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Dawn! That was it!
...don't feel like it either.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Must be somebody?
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Well..
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Would you mind?
Okay. You win.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
They might think I was running away from something.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
And do you amuse the guests?
I didn't say anything.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
I didn't notice him.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
All right--following me.
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
And Betty Mayfield--
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
Morning. Any calls?
All right. Get him.
What are your rates?
Why not here?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
What's this in favor of?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Could be.
In case you want to have us followed.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
That must hurt.
You'd be breaking the law.
Lay off, can't you?
Did I do something wrong?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
No doubt about that one.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Hello.
I'll have some of that.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
Both dead.
Why not stay?
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Jeremy phoned this morning
To the airlift.
Blasé and epicene.
Bastard.
Now, top secret file.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
It's shit.
Let me see.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
Ha ha...
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
The torture of small children--
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Not bad.
I'm not here.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
What would you call it?
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
Ever done this before?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
You gonna pull?
You first!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
I'm not armed.
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Fine.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Good move.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Shrimp and fries.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Nice place.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
You had enough?
Look at you.
Those are cold.
Bye.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
What story did you give to Davis?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
He's not really my uncle.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
You looking' for some company?
The price just went up to ten.
No.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
For the whole night?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Can I have some chips?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Do you plan everything?
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Why?
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
What are assets?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Four thousand.
I got a dress, yeah.
What about dinner?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
You still mad at'm?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
What's that?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
What time's diner tonight?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
What kind of school?
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
What?
Get out!
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
You're a silly girl.
Of course you will.
I will never doubt again.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
It never happened.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
You're quick.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
What?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
-- well, when does it get good?
Yes.
Who gets Humperdinck?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Slow going?
How old were you?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Making sure nobody's following us.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
You've made your decision then7
Australia.
You guessed wrong.
An hour.
Bye-bye, boys.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
I never should have listened to you.
Max, I...
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
Yes.  We would!
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Like clockwork.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Nietzche...
Hindenburg...
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Okay.
Where are you going vit the light?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
I'm not the police.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Of which morning?
What do you mean?
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
And when she left, she never came back.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Let's all talk about Mary.
Why?
Can I trade in my car and take another?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Did he say anything about my sister?
I'm Mary's sister.
Is something wrong?
What should I know?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Is Mary... in trouble?
I ought to call the police right now!
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Arbogast said...
Stay here.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
Huh?
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I've caused you some trouble.
Is your time so empty?
You go out... with friends?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
You should... mind it.
Except you.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
Phoenix?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
I'm sorry.
Mary is Lila's sister?
I'll get your bags.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
...Forty thousand dollars!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
You didn't find anything.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Just before she died she came to--
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
That's it. You get it quick.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Take me down there.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
I'm going to call the police.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
But what about lunch?
There's no hurry. It's early.
I think so.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Thank you.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
How much money have you got?
What is it? What happened?
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Could we go somewhere?
Why am I doing this?
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
He did?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Yeah, I know.
You were up late last night, Brother.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
What do you think, Brother?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Daddy, what's the matter?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
She's watching the car again?
Is that all?
She's putting the titty back.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Are they polar bears, too?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
That's what she would say herself.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Is she all right?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
You mean a farm?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
I don't believe it.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Oh, yeah?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
What's the matter with him?
Afraid of the hospital?
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
More history, Rose.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
I... I can explain...
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Who cares?
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
That wasn't my fault.
Sons of bitches!
No offices are gonna be open today.
Wh... what... ?!
What about him?
They... they shot me.
You don't smoke.
Happy Independence Day.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
That's him alright.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
General Jim Beam, then.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
Where have you been?
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Well, sir...
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Arriving tonight
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Let's get this thing done.
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Just got here.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
You always did have style.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
But I have no sister.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I have felt him, my Master.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Hey, are you awake?
Shall we try and go around?
He wasn't. I can feel it.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Here we go again.
What are you telling them?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
He's my father.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Told you, did he?
Oh. Well, yes.
You!
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I've got something to say.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Well I want to leave.
You know this earth - this person.
You did right.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
"Sweet Transvestite"
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Creature of the night.
...I'm sorry.
Looks quiet, y'know.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Yes, I do.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I always knew you was pretty.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
My side.
No doctor!
...Stop jivin'!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Six!
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
That's it? -- Completely?
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Gonna try.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Hey --
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
I won't.
The legs must be goin'.
...No.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
When was they here?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Yo, Benny.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
See how fast he is -- damn!
...The guy's great.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
What?
Don't get mental, man.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
...I can't haul meat no more.
Do you feel you have a chance?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
So where is it then?
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Is this paper even good?
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where is he?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
What a gasser.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
I'll get it.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
Have patience!
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Out--
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
I'll not endure him.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
I take thee at thy word.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Meaning, to court'sy.
I will follow you.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
What is?
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Lose them!
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Nobody's saying they don't.
I better be getting that.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
That fucking figures...
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
He's company.
Here's yours.
There's been a slight problem.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
In here...
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
So what is it you want to know?
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
You should watch what you eat.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Where is this broad?
What'd you say to him?
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Like Larry or Swede.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
And what job is that?
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
I never made that claim.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
Right now?
I'm not here very much.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Would you stop with that...
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Closest and oldest.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
That's a good question.
Why didn't you kill her?
Damn.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Well someone's gonna find them.
Why?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
Uh huh.
I'm all ears.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
What are you proposing?
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
Shut up, Jesse.
What's that?
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
What's wrong?
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
He's not, he's...
I don't know.  My friends...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Test the product?
Yeah.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
And what's that?
What?
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Anything I can help you with?
Shopping here?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
C?
Damn it’s hot in here...
Jesse?
What's this?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
It was going to be a surprise!
What are you saying?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
No, sir.
How much is that?
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Carter?
You.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Is it hot in here?
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
She saved our lives.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Steamed dumplings?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Are you serious?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Vegas...
Red Dragon.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Dancing?
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Put your arms around me.
I need your help.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Shut up!
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
He was just doing his job.
It's the same thing!
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
What about them?
I know a shortcut.
He was trying to kill me, not you.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Good God, ya'll!
What are you doing here?
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Not anymore.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Jesus...what do you want?
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
She's fine.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Yes.
I am so sorry about your men.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one!  Thanks.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Bob's in a hurry.
"Sink the putt."
"Nothing but net."
Fisher, let him talk.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
And you are?
They made me put my hat back on.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Can you fix it?
You humiliated me!
What!?
Used?
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Ya think?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
I love you.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
Walter, I'd love to --
What is it?
Who is it?
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
That doesn't make any sense.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
You should write something about this.
Actually, he sounded nice.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
What?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Hello.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
It's a sign --
So I mailed your letter.
M.F.E.O.?
You're going to miss the train.
No, I'm not. 
What?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Magic.  It was magic.
Magic.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
You don't like the one he was now?
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Dad, could you close the door?
Yeah.  What's that?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Fine.  Fine.
So I can go.
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
This one's for both of us.
Great.
Not now, Jonah --
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
I was thirsty.
Are you going with her?
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
I read the same article...
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
You want 'em all arrested?
How goes it?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
No, Estellita.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
I waited up till midnight.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Oh God.
Nothing.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Why not?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
What happened to your eye?
Never heard of him.
Is that how you play?
This has nothing to do with him.
What is wrong with you?
Who is it?
What is it?
Oh shit
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Finland is a country.
You on a roll?
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
But...I've seen you.
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
No, I'm good.
Now get talkin'
What?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
It's not my place.
I was getting to it.
When?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
We know what's going on.
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Again, I thank you.
And you've got wiener breath.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Report.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
A private, sir?
You writin' a book or somethin'?
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Jackson?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
It's worth it.
It seemed appropriate.
Over three-hundred.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Captain, what about our deal?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Caen?
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
PUSH!
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
You're kidding yourself.
How about...?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
And how do you bluff yourself?
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
I think you're right, Keith.
I know.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Frogs?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
How do you do it?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
This evening is over.
Thanks, I like yours too.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Then what's love?
That's just so embarrassing.
See you tomorrow.
What does it say?
I don't feel anything.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
You like it?
Ha!
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
I'm fine.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
No, but you stole from them.
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Keymaster?
He does this every year?
Thank-you.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Basic.  Hmmm.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Yeah?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
No, we don't have to say it.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
No, no.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
Is this because of your dad?
No.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
You told your dad?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
What?
I'm totally and completely serious.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Diane Court.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Hey.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
I was gonna...
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Oskar, please -
What?
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
I need a drink.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
That's very generous of you.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
Why aren't you there?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Cotton.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
It’s over, Cotton.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Two.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Or it found us.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
We had to have financing.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Can we turn the light on?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
What do you mean?
Yes, goddammit!
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
I have rehearsal.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
The young girl is slashed again.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..this week's TKE kegger...
She's not here right now.
Do you want to die?
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Please, call me Gale.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Where are you Dewey?
Where's Gale?
They've got her!
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Sidney, what happened?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
But you know who she was.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Geez.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Are you sure?
How'd you do?
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
You ready to party hard tonight?
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
Ready?
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
I thought she was dead.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
No...
Or even a good porno.
You heard me.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Fuck you.
What number is this?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Hello.
Popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
What do you want?
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
No...
...leave me alone... please...
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
And why is that? Has something happened?
No, not yet.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
At the airport.
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
What about the cellular phone bill?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Where is she?
You owe my mother.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
You're evil.
I have no idea.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Are you alone in the house?
No you didn't.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Which is you...
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just like old times, ain't it?
And you believe it?
No way.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
Give it to me.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
So what?  This victim...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
No, I haven't heard.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
I heard.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Spit it out.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
Not here.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
It's too soon for him.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Oh, that's all.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
How did the fire fight end?
It is Victor.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
And so what?
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
You got to be kidding.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
So they ran our list.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
I'm fine.
Wait... just wait.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
We could use about fifty more men here.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
No.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
I don't see anything.
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
You ain't goin'...
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
JOINT action?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
What you want me to call you?
You all right, Ethan?
Think she means for us to follow?
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Not far from it...
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
She'd be about thirteen now...
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
I mean the armchair!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
You?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Maybe an animal.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Twenty-three, to be exact.
It's good.
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Never!
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
We will all be put in the clink.
Nothing comes.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
And his ears.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
This time we take your boots off!
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
What? Who?
By God, I wish I knew.
How goes it, Will?
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
"Good morrow, cousin."
"But new struck nine."
Two hours at prayer!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
When the Queen commands it.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Your Majesty.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
Who is there?
The same, alas.
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh, do not go
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You cannot marry Wessex!
No…no.
Will you read it for me?
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
My lord.
The Queen has consented?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
And break her heart and mine?
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, Thomas!
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
How do I offend, my lord?
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
I'm only asking what you think.
He made it clear.
Only on expenses.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't you worry about that.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
How much?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
So I gathered.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Is this being recorded?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
I've never seen any of these men before.
I don't know them.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
What?
Parked outside?
That's it, then.
Yes.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
-- which is a hack.
You're right.
Hugo.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Don't.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
No, Alex. It's, it's --
No, I don't.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
You're frightened.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's about the burglary.
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Of course.
Who said there were four?
Yes, absolutely.
Yes.
Why do you want a room here?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Are you all right?
Two hundred pounds?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
I'm not sure --
Oh, him. Well, he died.
What do you do?
What's it about?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
And he's a patient of yours?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
The first one was fine.
I suppose so.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Lester.
That's okay too.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Your husband?
Is she all right?
I know.
Oh, no.
... what?...
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
I guess so.
Yeah.
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
Yeah.
That you're just like your mother.
You are.
You do know what money's like these days.
What sort of references do you have?
I've got heads here, Norman.
So how's Norman?
I'm sure.
He's a very private person, actually.
No.
Why not?
And what?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
-- don't you want to --
Where do you want to go?
Sammy's?
Look who's talking.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Where are you going?
Well then what are you trying to do-
I don't know... Jackie?
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- yeah, this is --
That's too bad.
Where?
What's gonna happen?
Keep moving --
I am?
Will we live together?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Maybe you don't even like children.
You've never even been around one.
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Yeah, baby.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
About what?
Whether or not I'm going.
When I get off work.
When is that, George?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Bullshit.
Yes.
-- please, baby --
-- no, it'll help me, really --
Yeah, I know. Did you?
What did you say?
Said what!
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're right.
Oh yeah?
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
What about Jackie?
A daytime soap opera.
George is going to open a shop.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
-- Yeah, honey...
Jackie --
He does?
I would say so, yes.
C'mon.
Egypt?
That's right.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
I'm terribly sorry.
No.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Yes, Dad.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Yeah.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Because he hides.
But eh what was the matter with him?
What sort of injury did he have?
It's okay, really.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
She eh... interferes.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Sure is.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
Yes.
As soon as possible.
Stop swinging the bat.
Only in a very general way.
Hi.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
Rats...
Was it a prescription?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
What if I say no?
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Thanks.  A lot.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Why?
What is it, Mary?
It's true -- I know her.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
What?
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
You have to help me
She won't?  Why not?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
I'm getting experience.
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
You were unhappy?
What's a concubine?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
No problem.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Out of the question.
You sent for me?
But -- why?
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
How?
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
She's gettin' away!
You didn't shoot!
A sweater.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
She's a nun, Vince.
She's... she's a nun.
Where?
Who took the meat?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Bring Young Masbath here.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
What is that you wear?
Listen to what you say....
Where are we going?
Out there.  What do you see?
It's spectacular.
Should we go back?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
This is farewell.
What can we do?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
Must I hear this?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
What... what are you doing... ?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
What did he say, Katrina?
What would you have me believe?
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
Returning to the Western Woods?
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
What did you say?
What... what are you doing?
She has confessed.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
I don't reckon.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
All right then.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
They was a boy. We made friends.
Yeah.
Please Doyle, don't.
Don't tell me what to do.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Childers.
Did you want to play ball with us?
They still around, your folks?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
All right then.
All right then.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Is that right?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Karl, you up?
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
We sure like havin' you.
I done et just a little bit ago.
Oh. How about before that?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Do you smell shit?
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what are you, his chaperone?
Better make it charge. 
American literature. What else?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
And what about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
The Queen of England?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
They're all the same.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
What do you mean?
Slow down, huh?
Hey, man, good to see you.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
I mean, it's a good story.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You don't give up, do you?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Why don't you open it and find out?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
Thanks for the tip.
What does that mean?
You mean Rashid?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
He's dead?
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Come on, just a little hint.
The end.
Celebrate? What for?
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Did you say more?
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
Greedy.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
We don't let go, you s...
You always run with the well open?
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
And what's that?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
I don't think so.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
Sure, anything's poss...
Not in those words.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Funny?  In what way?
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
A what?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
What happened?
No we're not.
But suppose he loses?
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
You'd better go fix it.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
How can we?  We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
You know - the old shell game.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Have I got things to tell you!
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
What'll I tell him?
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
I have a very low resistance.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Here you are, Sugar.
What do you think you're doing?
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
I'm a what?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
No!
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
- and you got to be girls.
Help yourself.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
I'm not surprised.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Bull fiddle.
This is where I get off.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
About that roadhouse -
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
You can't trust those guys.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
What's happened?
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
You're not hurt, are you?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Up, up, up.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Yeah.  Real hot.
I beg your pardon?
What theory?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Really?
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
Daphne -
What'll it be, sir?
Coffee?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Why wouldn't I?
What for?
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
I should get going.
You know what? I’m not having this conversation right now.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Nothing.
Shrink, actually.
Hey, Kat.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
I’m sorry?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
What does your gut say?
Six thousand, right?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
How did you know that was me?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
You shit!
Don’t stop asking questions, okay?
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
Oh, cut the crap!
Hey, Sal.
You want me to let him in?
Hi, kiddo.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
You could? How?
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
What do that mean?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
I did look, Charlie, but I--
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Where was you, Daddy?
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
What's your daddy's name?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Who's winning, Mama?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
'Bye, Mama...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Be good and be smart, little boy.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
Hello, David...
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
I wanta get some things.
Whatcha wanta order?
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
What... are you?
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Pillow.
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Suck my balls.
Hey Cartman.
Mph rmph rm!!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Hello there, children!!
May I?
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Mrph mprph!!
Yeah, I guess.
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
That's gonna take a long time!
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
How can they do this?
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Yeah, so what do we say?
Oh, brother.
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
The F word?!
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
It's from your mother.
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Getting drunk is no solution.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Oh yeah...
Magnificent, magnificent.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Is that clear?
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
I can't let you do that.
Explosive?
What's that?
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
Dawn.  Come in.
Will you marry me?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
What is happening around here!!!
Carlo!
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Well now what are we gonna do!
Baby, take it easy.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
You a mini-golfer?
You have orange whips?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Sure, Sid.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
It's mine.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
I got a right. You're my father.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Son?
My poor baby!
Hello?
I found dad.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
How's that?
Buzz Fazeli.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
No!
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
What ever happened to just bowling?
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
I'm a bowler.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Uh...over easy.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
The mental hospital.
Can I ask you something personal?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Why were you suspended?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
What's plan C?
So why do you stay?
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
I could let them go for ten.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
Why not?
Are you sure he's dead?
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
Fuck plan C!
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I'm not here to bowl.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Who identified the body?
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Open it, Captain!
Fletcher!  Now!
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Forty yards.
But you've tested it?
Thank you, Colonel.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
What?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It's impossible.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
She should've known better.
Damn it, Edmunds?
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
What?
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
How can he be missing?
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Underwater?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
Where'd this come from?
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
What about you?  What happened to you?
What do you mean -- not normal?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
You went through Edmunds' things?
You did, didn't you?
Beth --
Forget the sub.
I would.  But my suit --
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
Diphenyl parlene.
Valdomet.
Sintag.
Antibiotic.
How do you spell it?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
What's that?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Someone did.
You're lying --
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
Beth --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Then where's it coming from?
Beth?
Get away from me!
How's that?
No.  I don't think so.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?
What?
C'mon.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Not a clue.
I don't follow you.
I can't believe that, Harry.
What is that?  That noise?
What noise?
How do we decode it?
The three of us.
I don't think so.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
You mean forget?
What'd you say to him?
She told me what you said, Norman.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
What'd you say?
The ships?
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
You mean a picture?
I don't see anything.
Try this one.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Good morning!
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
What do you mean?
That's where my father was killed.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
What about the princess?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
You're Starkiller?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Watch it!  Move back.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Something... I've got...you don't.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Why not ?
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Who cares ?
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
You're late.
Do you mean it ?
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Guess you gotta go.
No thanks, Diz.
Cover me.
It stinks, you goin.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
Diz, see what you can do.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Sir, thank you, sir !
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Best in the Fleet !
What do you think you're doing ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
How bad are you, pal ?
What is your position ?
Good for you. Go find out.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
They have repressed the Creator.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Was he difficult?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Hold station...!
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
You like my play.
Yes.
It's about life.
I...
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
But, but but but...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
And likewise.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Everyday things...yes.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I live there.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You'd know better'n me.
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
The other side.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
...yes.
That's right...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Lookit that, up already.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
What are you going to do?
What is it, a surprise?
What are they offering?
That's so beautiful...
Hi!
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Wat...
Fourteen year old girls.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
Bobby, don't say anything.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
I...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
I've always seen that.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
It's night.
Izzat so?
Look.
But not that <u>way</u>...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
You can't do what?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I know that...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...wants a piece...
Yes.
I...
I know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Did she throw up?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
Not now.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
I can't.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
I treated you like a son or nephew.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
I...
What did you say to them...?
What is that...?
It's lovely.
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
If you do the product placement...
He's got a gift for fiction.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
I've got two days to get this house...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Look she's upset --
Wow.  Who's that for?
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
No.
Excuse me --
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Poof!  You're happy now.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
You have the WORST flu since...
That's Rache's song!
No!  I have to get there.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Something's up wi...
Our children.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Look, I...
I have a snoop.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
My boss.
Look, you've never liked me...
You bet you are.
See, I know that.
Small world.
I really look like shit.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
That's not wh...
Thanks for coming out.
No, there isn't.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
What do I have that you don't?
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
For what?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
I think so...What do you think?
Can we go sit somewhere?
There are some rumors...
Nice to have you here.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
It was God's will.
I'm always working.
Speak English.
Poison gas.
This is definitely better.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
What's an audience going to tell you?
Fine.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
That's good.
Ni...
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Three.
You a pervert?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Now what?
Well Filmore--
Are you going to kill us?
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What do you mean?
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Drop the anchor!
Possibly some coffee?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Now, snap out of it, fella!
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
General Schmuck?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Well, Mister President.
You aren't sure!
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Thank you, sir.
That is correct, Major.
I suppose they are, sir.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Go on, Major.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
And you'd like to see that?
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
What the hell is Plan-R?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
How long will it take to receive them all?
Have you tried the recall again?
General, stick to the point, please.
Roger, maintain.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
He's dead, all right.
Look, this is different.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Who's that?
Have you tried the emergency system?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Sure, King.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Can I have some?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Hey, you said you did a video?
A cloud?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Don't let 'em fight.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, I'm not worried.
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Erica is in the van back there.
She's dead.
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Shit.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Yeah, we're all above that.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
Yeah!
Yes!
Hi.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
He is.
Mm.
What was your name again?
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Hi.
Erica, you coming?
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Sooze wants to see him.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Please?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Your sure as hell right about that.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No, I don't.
You do.
Come on.
No. No, no, no.
Mm-hm.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Wait, away?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Really?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
What?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Look Pakeesa...
Get off my roof!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Is that your driver?
Oh!
Oh, yeah?
Like?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Yeah?
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Yeah?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Diane?  Diane!
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
But, we have to make a smart plan!
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Hannah, we've...
Screw Lucy!
Really...
Uh...maybe?
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I didn't mean to --
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Roll 'em.
In a deep freeze.
Good party.
I'll take it.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
Hurt feelings department.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
What were you -- a child actress?
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
If you love me, Joe.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We've missed you too, dear.
You're a writer, you said.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
December twenty-first.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Where do you live?
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
I'll take care of that.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
I've lost my car.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
A little.
What's that?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
You made her a star?
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
And she's turned you into a servant.
You know better than to interrupt me.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
What is it?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
He will be. In about five minutes.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Western Europe.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
All this talk about love, it's silly.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
I don't love you any more.
Away. From you.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
It seemed that way to me.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Hmmm?
I did.
They think I have a concussion.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
No!
Why the empty cage?
Theories?
Yes.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
What's a tree?
Where is Earth?
Don't you believe in knocking?
What can I do for you?
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Nigel, get lost.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
Are you happy, Zaltar?
Then teach me how.
Then come with me.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
There's no vodka in it.
Brad.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You know what's the problem?
I didn't --
You...um...you never got married?
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, thanks.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Sure.
Mmmmm . . .
What kind?
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Gus?
Uh...
Black or regular?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Why do I have to do this?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
But the bridge...
Lots of things...
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
But the other night...
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
Gus?
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Okay? Goodbye.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
85,000 dollars.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
He's the only one who can operate this --
Lois, I usually do.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
I'm listening.
Everything on it?
Uh...home...
Does Lois know about this yet?
Wrong.
Why didn't you go before we left?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
He flies as well, then . . .
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Put down Lex Luthor !
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
I really don't think . . .
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
What about here?
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
But why the hair?
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Albert!
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Know what?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
What are you doing here?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
What's the temperature now?
Meteorites!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
What do you suggest, my dear?
Ready?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Boy!
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Who...who...
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Thirty-five.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Luthor  --
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
They'll soon be over.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Which one?
I...don't think so.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Yeah.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
It does concern me.
A while.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
You believe that?
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
Did they give him special care?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
I did.
Yes.
I didn't say that.
It's like a song.
What's vermin again?
Yes.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
Dolores.
I'm in a car wash.
Do you have the blood test?
What is it?
You've been retained?
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Who did they get for that?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
And where did you sit that morning?
Yes, I understand.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
What's so funny?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Great.
I don't know.
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
When?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Sidney, I told you -
I thought he would.
Bribing me again?
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Avidly.  He was staring.
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Don't you know who that man is?
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
If the stores are open -
I made you write a beautiful song...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
Those lying motherfuckers!
We should abort.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Why?
Does it hurt?
Affirmative.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Chill out, dickwad.
Smile?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Drive faster.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Remember what I said, you can't...
We don't have much time.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Out of the way, John!
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Mom?  You okay?
They took him from me.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Why attack Russia?
Eating is eating... and...
What does he mean, too correct?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
So what is it?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
What?
Your manner.
Not yet.
Think you can get me any of that?
What's in those files?
Of course.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
I don't buy that.
May I ask a question?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Von der Null?
And what did he say?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Major.
Yes, you remember.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Who's he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Yes, Chuck?
I hate the beige one.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
I volunteered.
Bag some Z's?
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
I bet you're ticklish.
I don't think I like this.
What are you doing?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Here, drink some of this...
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Send a unit.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You don't talk to me like that.
It was an accident.
See you around.
Home.
Why not?
Right.  Call me Christy.
What's wrong?
They're watching.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
Guess you missed it.
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Single?
Underwear?
About me?
Elizabeth?
I redecorated.  What about you?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
You're part of it...
Really?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Physical?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
The key?
Dinner's in the oven.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Goodnight.  See you home.
What's this about?
Look, where is he?!
Your ex-wife.
I don't like her.
Anything wrong... ?
Attractive...
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
What?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
All night?
You used the wrong test.
Nell!
And that will be a good place to end this study.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Sorry.
I don't know.
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
What?
What happened?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Not really.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Good night, Theo.
David?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
Anything but Japanese.
Like you.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
CQ what?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
He give me your address.
Something like that, yeah.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
It was you.  Downtown.
All of what?
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Where is he now?
Yeah?
Yeah, that's right.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Yeah.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Are you finished?
...Yes?
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Birdy.
Yeah.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Right! Strictly business.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Mm.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
I don't know what's going on. I--
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
It was Big Dave's.
...I don't get it.
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
...Probity.
Yeah.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
Uh-huh.
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
Huh?
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Uh-huh.
Second chair.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
What happened?!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
I hope you liked it.
I don't believe it.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
What's going on?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Jesus, what is this?
What kind of egg is it?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know.
What was it?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Is there another way around?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
You smell that?
I can't!
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why would we--
--a dead one at that.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
The creator of what?
I have a map.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
Well, what do you want to do?
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
This is where it started.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Let's go now.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
When you get to Fiji?
There's no one here.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Special Agent Scully --
You've been back to Dallas?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
No, they don't.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
And if it's unsuccessful?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
I know the name. Why?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
What?
Did you find something?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
It's like jelly.
I'd been told as much.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
What are you doing?
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
How deep does this go?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Nothing.
What then?
That went well.
Who says?
You're kidding me.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Awaiting his arrival.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Do I...
Oh, that was many years ago.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
I'm so sorry.
I wish I knew.
Wer ist da?
I'm going back home.
A parrot...Let it go.
...you know.
Harry.
That's the reason.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Where's Harry?
Just around the corner.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
When did you see him last?
Bring him in.
Well?...
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Be sensible, Martins.
Shall I go over there, sir?
Never heard of him.
She's been arrested.
What do you want me to do?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
...this way.
...your address?
...Popescu...
Could he have been conscious?
What else did he tell you?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Okay.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Nice work.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Big?
I'm sorry.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
It's on an island that no one get to.
No.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Is he a Nazi?
Why won't you talk to me?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
No, I think you shouldn't.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
That's a much easier game.
Who's Eichmann?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
What??!?
And? WHat did you notice?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
He has Israel.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Balint?
That's meat.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve...
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
I've got to get back to the --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Isn't it true?
Which one were you aiming at?
Open it up.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
You remember Miriam....
How did you know they were Jews?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
Where do you think you're going?
Adam Sandler.
So what?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
No!
I tell you she's mine!
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
Well, good night, then...
What else is there?
He can learn.  He is learning.
Don't.
Is he alright?  What happened?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
The rules are the rules.
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
No.
... Everything.
You still collect them?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
That's good.
Don't you have a heater?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Lucky I was there to save you.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
I'm going back home.
I'm still here.
Why?
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Assassin!
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Well... here.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
It's his heartbeat.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
What's your first move?
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
So. Do you have a name?
It's Esther.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
What was that!?
Yes Esther.
You two know each other?
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
What's wrong with him?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Get off of me you cripple!
What day is it?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
They don't say it to me.
Sure, I like my leopards
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
I want him to lock me up.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Oh, that's so interesting!
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
What do you do now?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
What are you getting at?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Are you all right?
Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
Who is he?
Maybe I want to feel badly.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
What! You can't be --
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
I found this at your brother’s.
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
Paul Lamont...?
When did you get back?
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
Leon hung himself.
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
To get me killed...?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
No.
Your secretary, huh!
Yes. How did...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Vous êtes Français?
You seem very sure about that.
What is?
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
I’ll be alone.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Uh-huh.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Three...
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Mossad?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne, stop it!
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
To be killed in battle?
I -- I don't understand...
We have to press home the attack!
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
We want her burned as a witch!
Dead you're worthless, darling.
No no, I'm fine, really...
But where are you going to be?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
How old are you?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
Please... may I have it back...
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Buying her?
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Your majesty, I really think you...
... as always, majesty...
Yes.
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Yes, but...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
My king.
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
My... visions...
Why not?
Yes... lots of things!
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
But you already confessed this morning...
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
I want to be with him always...
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
How are you doing?
wish I knew you better.
It costs.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
Can you help? I've no money...
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
No, I don't think so?
What's your work?
Where are you hiding?
What's all that gunfire?
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
The Alps.
I worry for you.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
No.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Wash them again.
What on?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
What do we do?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
Hackers.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
Why?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Raise 500.
See and raise five.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
I'll square it with the fixer.
You done?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
What time you get off work here?
You move right along, don't ya.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
I feel lucky tonight.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
What is it?
No.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Don't.  It's horrible.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
Your father?
I don't know.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
It's a promise?
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Yes.
Gilbert!
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Nothing.
I'm asking you.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Who's your candidate?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
You mean that body-----?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
That's ridiculous.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Where were you?
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
What are you going to do?
I don't like him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Well, let me do that for you.
Thanks, and goodbye.
But what if you need more money?
It might.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I didn't knock Julia off.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
So it's you he was after!
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
Want a drink?
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Finished with these?
Aren't you hot in that?
Did I give it to you?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Maybe I will.
He's just been for a walk.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Couple of months anyway.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I've got a lulu -- why?
It's the only way it makes sense.
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
You his wife?
I just wanted to tell you...
I'm fired.
Baghdad.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Where'd they go?
Missile!
You're the one with all the ideas.
Get off him.
You said he was a deserter.
You're out of your mind.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
It's a combat action.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Blow me.
There might be something in there.
They'll shoot us!
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Must be a compartment.
It's just a mongoose.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
We can't just leave him.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
No!
Slip out your M-16.
What do you make of them?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
You get it yet?
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
Oh, Jesus!
You have to go with us, Wes.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
You down?
Correct.  Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Control ON.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
Now.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
They don't know.
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
I'm leaving.
What?
That's not it.
Yes.
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Anything else I should know?
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Right.
What's up?
Nothing.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
I don't know.
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Alex, please.
You touch me again and--
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Don't talk.
Reilly, Vice. I-
Captain...
Goddamit, Reilly--
What's this?
It's our only option.
I know.
And it had diamonds in the back.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
What did you talk about?
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
No.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Um-hum!
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
M'sieu ...
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Thank you, Major. 
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Disappointed?
Please.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Last year? It can't be that long.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Seven and nine!
They're all right, aren't they?
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Now, Lily--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
But, Lily--
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Beautiful specimen.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Correct!  Good night.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Yes, I would!
Like that!
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
<u>Adolph</u>?
Goodbye...
It could have been marvelous ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, m'sieu!
Yes, madame!
I think you'd better go.
Yes, my bag!
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Holy shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
We're too late.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
This should be amusing.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
The fall alone would kill you.
I know what ice fishing is!
Mr. Dawson, I --
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Never let go.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Guess again, copper.
Could I see you a minute?
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
So you washed it off!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Brett is the name.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Tell me.
Isn't she attractive?
Very--your mother?
Well, I can't.
When?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I could see you were pining away--
How well do you know her?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
I thought you were a smart guy.
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
About sixteen hundred.
Come in! 
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Why?
She did?
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
What?
That's me!
I was never stiffer in my life.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Like it?
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Yes, Yes!
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Congratulations.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
I sincerely hope so--
There you are, sir.
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
God damn son of a...
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Nice voice.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Not exactly...
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Satisfied?
Maybe I ought to go out there.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
You're a little touchy about it.
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
I have to go.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
But this time they'll be ready.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
That a fact?
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
What about all these saloons?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Is that any way to say hello?
Do you feel better now?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Gone fishing.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
That's reassuring.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Who knows? Fog, night...
Interesting presentation.
No.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Have we met?
Boyfriend?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
No -
How is it now?
What is HE doing here?
How sweet.
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
What about ID's?
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
What for?
I'm busy.
What is that?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
Not anymore, not in the city.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Go back to sleep.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
I'm worn out.
What happened to your hand?
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
How is everybody?
How is he doing?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Those boys never did have good luck.
How many people do you all feed?
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
What are you doing?
How are you?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Hey!  Wow!
Hello-o-o...
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
I could have stopped him.
Right?  Buddy?
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Hold on, Woody!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
You are a liar!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Sir!  No Sir!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
W-w-w-we?
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
But you're Irish!
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
He made that. In his off hours.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Who's there?
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
How long has -
I appreciate you coming in so early.
I... I don't really know.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
He's not here.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
How much do I pay him?
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Did you get it?
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Did you meet the President?
Will we get invited to the White House?
In school?
What's that mean?
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Depends who it's from.
I'll put this in the back.
You may speak.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
You're breaking my heart.
Yes, sir!
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Who?
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
One question.  How did you find about this?
Only if he can be trusted.
I'm aware of that.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
She hasn't called you?
Like you protected Landry?
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You've stabbed me, man.
Twenty thousand.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
What?
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
It's an interesting theory.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
No, I'm clean.
Cheers.
Exactly.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Despite the Academy award?
It wasn't that bad.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
So?
Four Grand.
Are you serious?
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
The Sick Boy method.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Your usual table, sir?
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Six weeks and no sex?
So what's it going to be?
Homeless people?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
No, no, it's not possible.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Following new course. Warp seven.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?
Have the Klingons responded?
Where did you get this power?
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
And that is?
MM.?
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
To land any closer would risk detection.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
The emergency channel, open.
Spock... don't.
Spock?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Who are you?
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
You are mad!


Sybok, you must surrender.
Spock?
Why not?
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Dillinger?
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Your old files -- ?
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Did he say why?
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
Flynn!
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Yeah...?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Yes?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Where did you hear that name?
What's that?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
How about you?
A User -- in our world?
How 'bout yourself?
Feel what? You okay?
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Yes.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Copy that.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Guy's a spook!
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
But you didn't.  Why not?
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
And you still reach for your piece every time.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
They said you had to run out.
No.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
My husband can't know about this.
I can do it!
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
So what's your angle?
What about the husbands?
Beat it.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Worse than Cairo?							*
Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
And you chased one?
What is it you need me to do?
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Who is this woman?
Not yet.
You got that playing basketball?
Has he looked through it yet?
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
How 'bout me what?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
What kinda music do you like?
Turn-offs?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
You know when you sat behind me?
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Yes.
Was it him or you?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Naw naw!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Clarence?
It's great to hear from you.
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys.
Clarence...
Clarence.
In case.
Do you really mean it?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
What?
He wants to talk ya.
No.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I'm really not very -
What do you want from me?
What?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Nope.
Who is he?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
You and Robin moved?
Sure. No problem.
Sure was.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
How the fuck could he know?
Rock whores.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Him?  You saw that man?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I need to go now.
It's so clean.  No germs.
What year do you think it is?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
"Never cry wolf!"
What?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
What's that mean?
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
What....???
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
You really want to know?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Might be tight.
What?  What did you say?
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
How much time?
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Genuine Draft?
What do you want?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Who was that on the phone?
There's someone in the house.
I'm just going to my car.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
Jesus.
I got it.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Least you can leave.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Those are white words, not ours.
My face tell you all that?
Beautiful?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
What are you talking about?
There is no us, remember?
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
You got a suitcase?
To get my car.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
But I want to say with you,
I think I busted my leg.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
Who the hell are you?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You've got to be--
Live there?
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Why would I kill her?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
What makes you say that?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
How much could you get?
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
That's a thick change of heart.
You're not talking sense.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
I want to stay.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You expect me to believe that?
You're fucked.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
I don't understand what the--
You want something?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
You broke my nose!
You've got to be--
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
I came for Grace.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Cause she's dead.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Hey.
Don't look like nothing.
Hundred-fifty.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
I got it.
You're welcome, Grace.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
What do you do anyway?
You never did answer my question.
You love him?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Is it pretty?
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
The money's right here! Get the key!
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
My mother died in this canyon.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Which you don't have.
Out of here.
But, in particular?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
Son of a bitch!
Anybody hurt?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
Think carefully?
Why?
What do you want?
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Like what?
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
I'm going to work out.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
How are you feeling?
Did you get up from your seat?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
I thought... you was an angel.
Are you really going to kill them?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
You want... a free one.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
She back in Kansas?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Hit your finger, huh?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
I could of... easy.
Yeah, I guess so.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Yeah?
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
You could have it. All of it.
You sure you ain't armed?
Three ways?
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
You're marking us, Bill.
Shit.
Yeah... you said that last night.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Hullo, paw.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Far enough.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
I know who he is.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
How are they going to do it?
Fenster and Hockney?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Let's say for example -
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
What did you say?
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
Which is shit.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
No.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Why didn't you say anything?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Because he was my friend.
This is all bullshit.
I knew him. He would never -
Abrams...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
He was accused of jury tampering.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I didn't do too well for you.
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I read the hospital report on your client.
Her doctors killed her.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
I object, your Honor...
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Hello, I'm calling from...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Yes.  It was, actually.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
You're talking like a drunk.
Who told you that?
Is there going to be a later...?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is that to you...?
I have to talk to you.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Are you out of your mind...?
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
That's right.
Are you with me...are you awake...?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
The 'History'...?
... I know.  I went ...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
How old is he?
Thank you.
Mrs. Simmonds.
I used to be a nurse.
Yes.
Another, Frank . . . ?
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
You don't have to do it for a living.
How long have you been back?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Well?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Why did she never tell her daughter?
What happened?
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Then will you for me?
Can I see you tomorrow?
Will you, Judy?
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Scottie, why are we here?
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Some money.
Where had you been before?
When?
Oh... wandering about.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
What?
Meet again, sometime.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
I don't like them.
Why?
No birds live here.
How do you know?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Ow!!
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Step number two.
Do you know him well?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Mm. Better.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
I didn't hear you.
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
You're not a team player.
The hell I don't.
What?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Stop it!
Bury her out in the desert.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What?
We have to get going.
There is no candy!
That's one idea.
No. I think it's fucked.
Don't ever stare him down.
I want you to hear me out.
My god.
Money?
Well, oh...
So. When is the wedding.
Who?
That's right.
He just had two.
Shut up.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Shut up Boyd.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's cracked up.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
What does that mean?
I don't know...
Israel doesn't have a King.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
You said nobody would miss her.
Goosed!
What?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
That's absurd.
With all my heart.
Keith do not trivialize this.
What are you doing?
Yeah. Nesting.
Hey. It's me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
No way.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
So what do we do?
What?
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
I love you dad.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
What is it?
The first day.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
Did he try to kiss you?
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
That's our plan.
Good times.
Fucking desert.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Enedina and Paco ...
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Who is she?
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
That's fifteen by seven?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
Do they worry you that much, then?
Yes. Why?
What's he called?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Why not?
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
When you are, miss.
From the terrace.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
How does he know who I am?
Do I get to see it or not?
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't need a baby—sitter.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
Give me your wrist.
She's beautiful, you know?
What does that mean?
Where the hell are you going?
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
It's <u>producing</u>.
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Who's got the story? 
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
We're going to have to explain away the...
What crisis?
...but...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Yes.
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Our adopted land...
...uh huh...
Due in Nashville.
...I just missed my plane.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
Oh, God...
Oh, Lord....
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Give'em another pill...
Oh, MiGod.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
Whaddaya think?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
...why?
Dartmouth
Trade Re1ations.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
What do you think would hold it off?
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
We don't need an Act Two.
"Back End" ... count on it.
Three-o-three...
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
What?
In the Folk Music Section.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
The Albanian Campaign.
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Wake up.
Get on your feet, boy.
You can't tell this story.
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
Do it later...  Okay,  now, "The Little Girl," who is she, what is she doing?  She is....she's ...Okay, okay, it's an Albanian village... She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
Better.
A beret.
With their berets...
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Oh really.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
You sure about this FAA announcement?
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
I guess it's time to hit the road.
What if they call him?
I don't know anything!
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Yeah, right...
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I don't understand.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Well, why stop at that?
Do you think you're ready?
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Businessman?
Yeah, yeah, OK
What's that?
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Weird and tiny huh?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
And uh, your nicotine sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
We're all here, and ready sir!
They seemed, closing by much 
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
How do you know it's a she?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Fine.
Yes, but...
Well maybe your wife...
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
That's not...It's not like that.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Your house is so beautiful.
No.
Stop.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
What is it?
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Nothing's happening.
What?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Did he say that?
How are you?
Did you...
And we moved out here for the quiet.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Think I may have cracked it.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
...Don't get all...
Are you lonely?
What are you...?  No.
Ow!
Oh God...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
I never asked you to quit!
You should have tried harder.
What's that for?
Nothing.
I know.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
With his hands!
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
When did she die...?
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
It wes a dream...!
Lasher - bring us through!
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
Lie...?
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Made it...?
What is wrong...?
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
I don't know what you are!!!
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
I'm glad you're around to say it.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Rowan...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
A bit much.    Lucas.
Hi.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
You okay...?
The one on the left - definitely...
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I'm sorry?
What did you do with her?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Where are you going?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
What is it now?
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
I thought I loved her.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
What gives, Don Corleone?
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
So that's a maybe?
Hi, Teddy Bear.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Yeah.
Sorry I--
It's okay. You need me?
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
Very funny.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
If you could just sign right there.
Great.
Me-ow.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm trying to help.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
I don't get the distinction.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Oh. Goodness.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
You were the new and improved you.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
My father must've been amazing.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
Bad news.
People pay good money for that?
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
The skinny brunette.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
Ray, you heard him...
About a year ago.
Why?
What about witnesses?
Oh, Ray... no...
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
The teeth, were they...
What?
A ride.  You want one?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
Kelly.  What is it?
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
You know what it takes.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
About what?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Davy.
Are you mad at me?
What?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Always hoping.  Or this...
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
That's a lot of butler.
All that jumping and kicking.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Know what this is?
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
What is that?
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
There's only seventy-eight.
Are those just button buttons or...?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
You tell me.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Your private train, sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
He had a pressing engagement.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
I beg your pardon?
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Thank you, friend.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
What's that?  I hear something!
You gotta promise to feed her.
Where's the baby??
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
She needs to be changed.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
This is not going well.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Your hole is healed, then?
I saw him.
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Who else knows?
Just us.
Who else knows?
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Home.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Does anybody know I'm here?
What?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
But Stoltzfus said...
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Everything okay?
No, Rachel...
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
He's not in this building.
No, you listen. Get out!
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Yes.
If any!
...resourceful!
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Did you say something?
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
And him a brain.
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh, my!
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd sooner wait outside.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
You're going to see a Wizard?
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
...ting the ruby slippers?
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Yeah.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
What happened?
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
I haven't slept in weeks.
Where do we go now?
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Yeah --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well --
You new?
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Is there another way?
He’s sealed himself in.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
The inside man?
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Yes.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
What is it?
James...
Then take me with you.
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you talking about?
...what?
You turned Renard.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
How appropriate.
What is this place?
Someone will come.
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
I'm here, Laurie.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
His . . . whatever.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
What was he doing?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
So do I.  So do you.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
What about you?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
What is this place?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Why is that?
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Is that all?
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
What game is that?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Yorgi asked me to.
We hung out last night, remember?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
What are you?
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
What are you talking about?
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Where are we going?
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
I can see that. Why?
What...?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Here we go again.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Sorry, "dude".
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
What's going on, my friend?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
What's wrong with him?
Into the Hudson?
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
Dr. Grey.
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
To find Rogue.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Is it enough?
You have the wrong house.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Baack!
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Of course.
Yes, don't worry.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Very....very!
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Surprised?
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
That's a tough choice.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
How long will this whole thing take?
What?
I beg your pardon?
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Vermicelli.
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Did you see anyone else down here?
Could be worse!
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
What did you find out?
All right -- where is she?
Is everything ready?
Get the sedative ready!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Oh, doctor!
And look at this, Doctor!
It looks that way.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
His schwanzstucker.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
