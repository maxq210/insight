Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Cameron.
She's not a...
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
No
Queen Harry?
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
What's normal?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Why?
Thirty-two.
How many people go here?
I thought you hated those people.
He's pretty!
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Hey.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
No, you weren't
What are you doing here?
Then you screwed up
I hate peas.
No.
No, I won't go with you
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
You think?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Say not here!  Cuba!
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
How did you manage it?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
I am listening, my son.
How long?
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
We're lost!
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
I'll make some for us.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Vodka tonic.
What's he looking for?
Any I.D.?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
This isn't homicide school.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Why not?
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
So...who's Nicky?
I kill someone famous.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
Answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
You promise?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Okay.  You ready?
Where's your partner?
Where is escort service?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Give me the address!!
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
I have five-hundred dollars.
What?
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
I did.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Yes, the money is good.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
I know.
I'm trying to tell you.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Well, he killed my partner!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
I'll send a cop back for you.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Mouth's clean, too.
Yeah?
Get outta here!
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?

Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Yes.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
What is it, Hal?
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
I see.
That's true.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Roger.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Pay money?
I'm candy...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Would you guys...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
Let's go.
We split 50-50?
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah, I see her.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Do I get to kiss her too?
Partnership?
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Thanks.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jack, wait...
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
You're impossible...
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
How would you know?
Stall.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
They all like this in your family, father?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What are you doing?
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Where's Leeloo?
Do you love her?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
30 seconds...
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Why not?
It's my wife.
Cornelius..
Apipoussan?
Uh...
You get that off the screen?
Where you going?
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Not going to open?
At least I won lunch.
Uh..
This is all that survived?
Have you identified it?
Staedert, do you read me?
Recommendations.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Why the gun?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
You're killing me...
Dino...
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
You brought the money?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
You're a dead man.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
I don't know...
Yeah.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Something like that.
What did you do with her body?
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Where does he sell it?
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Who is he?
He succeeded.
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Nothing remotely like this.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
It got to be too much for him.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
No, sir, he is not.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Been up with Alice.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I'll tell you later.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
What do you mean?
About him?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
There you go.  Love you.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Alice...
Since my little girl became a mom...
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
Did everyone call everyone?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
You, too?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Cyclops?
I think you're right.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
As we near the Pole...
Who with?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
That's a <u>face</u>???
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
See what?
Are you alright, Wade?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Tell me.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
You heard the news.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
You can't buy Wade off.
You might not kill it.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
How'd you get the job?
You stayed away?
On your sleeve.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
What?
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Was it funny?
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yes.
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
No.
You're a policeman.
Fuck you.
Could be.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
For a while.
How's she doing?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Money.
Think they're alright?
This is nuts.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
There's a furnace.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
It don't look right.
The other guy.
Where's Ma?
Love! I'm made of love!
Bang!
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Money.
Not particularly.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
I'm sorry, honey.
Alice!
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Put your pilot on.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Leave my daughter alone.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
She's a big girl.  She understands.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
You wanna knock of f?
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
Shit.
What's the story?
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Not now, Elaine.
Are you afraid?
Now!
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
That's not possible.
I don't want to live anymore.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
George Zipp said that?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
I just don't want to go over it any more.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
We have a visitor.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
I like my horizons narrow.
You are Cassandra?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Back off, George.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

You think this is the guy who did it?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
What?
Movement!
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
That's right.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's he scanning for?
How do you feel?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
...We're coming in.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Now many?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Locked.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
You're just reading me.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Did you ever have a baby?
Good morning.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
What's that?
You might be disappointed.
What did you think of the music?
Is she a good fuck?
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Yes!
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
No!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
What's the matter with you?
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Why not?
Excellency!
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
But! I'm a married woman!
Where's our friend?
He's doing his best.
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
He's adorable!
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes.
You don't have secrets from me.
No, really!
Oh, thank you, sir.
Not that I've seen.
Are you Herr Mozart?
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What did he say? What did he say?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Of course not.
Really? Why?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
How could I not?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
A Mass for the dead.
Do you mean that?
Shall I answer it?
We ended in F Major?
Also identical?
I think so.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Who is on this committee?
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Mozart -
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
All Vienna has heard that.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
I'll call tomorrow.
The American? Yes, duck.
Go about your duties.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Surely you're not suggesting...
He's fine. We'll come right over.
David?
What?
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
The bedroom.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
But...
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
No.
I looked.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Yes.
Did you see Jack?
Well, I like it here.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
That's a wolf's head.
Nice looking group.
Jack, we'd better go.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Heathcliffe.
It's in front of us.
Walk away, Jack.
It sounds far away.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
You're not real.
I wanted to see you.
Thank you.
What about the zoo?
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Yes - sure—
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
He has?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
What good will that do?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Say, you can't do that—
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
You understand?
Thanks.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
Why not?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
What is?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Why are you so anxious?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Helen!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
But I haven't . . .
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Why?
With what?
Yes.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Well . . . ?
Oh, Charlie again.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Are you sure?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Then who changed it?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
I guess so.
How?
I ain't done --
I'm sorry, Cole.
The Army can hang him.
You have no shame.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
I think I recognize you.
I could use the walk.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
I'm out.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Well?
I think one of 'em's glass.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
They gonna rush us?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
What do you say, sir?
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Such as?
You're doing just fine.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
This has been a good year.
You've killed your fair share of men.
We're doing this for Ma.
Oh yeah.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
But still died.
Jesse, are you awake?
You didn't want to farm?
And what's this right girl like?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Yes?
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
This time we'll make an exception.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Lyla Devereux.
Good.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
Sir?
What is that?
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
In English, Pinkerton.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
J&B. Straight.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
I don't want to talk about it.
He has a great body
I want a firm commitment.
We need to talk.
You're inhuman.
Good coloring.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Maybe it's just the light.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Leaving what?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
You don't like this, I take it?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Why?
No. Flattering, but no.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Uh huh?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
No. Not really.
No, he just hung out there.
Oh.
What?
Have you consulted a psychic?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
People just...disappear.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Yes.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
It's important.
...But?
That took some fun out of --
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He's your boss. He's not your --
What're you -- what?
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
Look at this.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
...What?
...wanna savor this.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
You really wrote this just today?
It scales, don't you think?
You've been coming in early.
This is good. Who did it?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
What've you got there?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
What?
Oh.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Why?!
What?
...You got my E-mail?
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
What is it?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Thank you, Exposition.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Be careful.
Yes Basil?
Good on ya, man.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
I'm sure.
I can't see a bloody thing.
How do you know?
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Everything seems to be in order.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Is it one of ours?
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
An evil petting zoo?
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't judge here.
Seriously?
May I help you, madam ...
I have an appointment.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
We want to help...!
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Too many cooks --
But -- why?
I'm already married ...
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
For a man in my position --
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
June, July ... August?
Any other vices?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Why should they think that?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Was I?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Not for a moment.
I'm playing to win.
No, after you.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
What is it?
Trubshaw again? What now?
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
What kept you?
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Global warming?
We want Mrs. Peel.
Amnesia?
Insane ... ?
In your operation.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
All right!
Cole...
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
I can't sleep.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
That's it.
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
Oops!
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Rick, I'm concerned.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Oooooo.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Oh these moments do try me...
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Did you do it for Tim?
Just come down, John. Just --
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Ready?
Brian, look --
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw it.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Thanks for calling.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
I could use a date.
Hi.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
I'll see ya around, huh?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Are you going public with this?
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Then who wrote the report?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Every little boy's fantasy.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
They're waitin' man.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Putty? On both doors?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
-- Burn them.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Yeah.
I forgive you.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
What money?
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Keep trying.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Yeah, him.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
Damn skippy.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
That ain't funny.
I won't do it anymore.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Who are the other characters?
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Hello.
You've said that already.
Your life will never be the same.
I don't want to hear it.
Light?
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
No joke.  Serious.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Peerless, your father called.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
To come back to our roots.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
I heard ya lady is wild.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Around...
...too early...
...too late, maybe around...
You slept too near where you got in?
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
The good stuff.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
No, before my time.
How did you get this gig?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
What is your uncle's name?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
And his baggage?
And so I am.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
The coward!
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your honor must lower his voice.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
For whom else have you worked?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Does this assignment interest you?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
He is only curious to know who you are.
Bill Styles...
What do we do?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
You too?
I asked for a policeman.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
You shot Childs and Nunez.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Cadet, what's your name!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
What do you mean, West's?
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
They?
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Is it the truth?
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Well?
Home, I'm done.
You think you could explain all this to me?
That's preposterous --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
You and the Colonel go back.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
That is the most unprofessional --
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You're kidding.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
That bugs you too?
We're fucked, I know --
You wanted to get the truth.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Pike, please --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
He said what?
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Wrong answer --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Thank God...
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
You get the eye?
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Will.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
How would you describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Promise me you'll come back.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Please. Go. Just go.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
Hi. How are you feeling?
I never knew.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
I like your stories.
You don't like it?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
You mean, while I'm here.
I will.
Dad!
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
I'm sorry.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
Yes.
How much time does he have left?
Of course.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
I need to know who you are first please.
Yes. I know.
Right.
No.
What was that?
John.
"Frenzy".
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
No I don't.
What?
Fine.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
He will come back.
And. It's wrong.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
You don't understand me.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
What?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Is your niece older than 12?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
At church?
When? Now? Oh. No.
No, ma'am.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
You wanna go home?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
What?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
LET ME GO!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Let go of me...
You take it straight?
Want another?
What is it?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
How you feelin' today?
I know that.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Naw!
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Thank you.
You could put it that way.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Hey.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
The hell you call me?
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
-- I should tear your head off.
Frank Abolofia.
Not a prayer.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
I didn't know.
This should be it...
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
You cool, Ich?
What does Charlie mean?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Why the hell not?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Nick!
Joyce?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I need someone to translate for me.
I still think you're a bastard.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
What...?  What if I say no?
It's not your job.
We're police officers.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
I have to get to Sugai.
He knows what he's doing.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
Let's go while there is still time.
Why?
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
I've done some questionable things.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Why are you staring at us?
What generation are you?
When?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Got it.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Next.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
These aren't just...
How do you mean 'exploited'?
Jeezus!
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
In your opinion.
I've already got more help than I need.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
So?
Do I make you nervous?
I told you I'd come back.
Dead.
Did you cry when your father died?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You know what I think?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Is this to be an empathy test?
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Don't move.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
But how come I'd be there?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
But I understand what you mean.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
I don't have one.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Oh, now, that's a great one!
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Let's go talk first, Adam.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Wait!  Wait!
Watching television in color.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Two weeks.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Because I want to get married.
I don't want to be alone.
Everybody's divorced.
One who's not a mutant.
Two weeks.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Of course.
Now, get out!!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
Yes!
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I like her.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
I'm really sorry!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
A card?
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
Gerade aus dann links!
Why?
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Yes, father?! Yes?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Uh-huh.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
What?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
Help you?
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
It's time.
It shuts off automatically.
The locks.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Hi, honey!
Mutants?!
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
We stay down here.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
I forgot some of my stuff.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Stop it, you two!
Give me your hand.
What's that supposed to mean?
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Eve?!
Those sluts!
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Buy it from me?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.
You're all through with this now?
Jeffrey.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I, I don't know.
Do you like talk like that?
Nothing. Are you alright?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Hi, can I come in?
Oh shit.
Nice guy. Who's he?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
No. I should go.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Are you a bad boy?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
What?
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
You want to see him too, right?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Why not?
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Goodnight.
Shoot.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You didn't tell him about me?
NO.
You want to dance?
Probably not. No. Why?
Go ahead.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Are ya ready?
Where's your gun?
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
What? What is it?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Hello.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Be careful.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Absolutely not.
For what?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
He isn't to be touched.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Twist of lemon!
Witness?
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Hello? You there?
Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Don't do this my son.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
The... The funny man.
He says. This is he.
She's really kind of hot.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
How was I ridiculing you?
Yeah, I heard that.
Is that the manager?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Inez, this is --
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
She's from Cuba.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
He's gone. He stole the car.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Why don't you come with us.
I wish I'd been there.
Our money situation is not good.
That's what she is!
What time did he say to be here?
Do you like Inez?
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
You're living on a sailboat?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Nice to meet you.
You mean like techniques?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
What do you mean?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
This is good.
Yeah.
Future Man.
Who?
Hector woudn't do anything.
Are you serious?
Bob, where you going?
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
No.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Like silk?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
That's your friend Anthony?
What's he doing here?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I don't know about that.
They are.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I think we might of scared her.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
He electrocuted someone?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
How much is there?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
It's registered in my mother's name.
My brother's in jail.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
You said 48 hours!
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
I know it, man. Hang on.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do they let you --
He said you ran away from home.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Is he good?
Well, I left some money in there.
There was a mistake.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Don't know.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
What do you want?
Try again.
It's just a nightmare.
We can't wait to be sure.
Why is she trying to kill me?
A Russian?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
You're sure?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Did you?
Is it fresh?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
But... what will you do?
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
So let the council swear publicly.
Young Robert, we are honored --
Does anyone know his politics?
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
I'll wait... back there.
I don't want to be a martyr.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
We don't split up!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Thank you for accepting.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I'm dreaming.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
We're gonna be late again.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Can't he come out for one day?
No.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
Please, mom. People will talk.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
How. Did you. Know that?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
You really think he wanted to kill you?
What the fuck are you doing?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I walk differently?
Why's that?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
It didn't feel like a dream.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
My husband is with me, too.
How long have you been married?
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Yes, something.
No.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I don't know the finish yet.
I don't think I will, Rick.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
But why my name, Richard?
Hello, Sam.
It's been a long time.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Yes?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Yes.
Hello, Rick.
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Thank you. I try.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
We'll be there.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
It was a combination of all three.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Victor Laszlo.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
His escape.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
You think of everything, don't you?
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Take it.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Why do they have to die for me?
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
They're harder to do than they look.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
What brings you out to the sticks?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Chuck.
Four four.  A record.
You don't seem too happy about it.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
If I'd known you were alive --
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
You okay?
I love you, Chuck.
When's the next Jumbo?
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
I most definitely say I am.
Yes, yes he did.
The place is falling apart.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
Take your time.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
You weren't dreaming about me.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
I mean your parents.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
How many months are you?
Really?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You don't miss it?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Please don't...
Hi...
I can't go nowhere.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
There! You said it was boring.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
What about the trees?
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Don't this place look like home?
It look nicer then home!
*What* view?
I told him that you all is sick.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
So, what do you do?
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
We had to finalize the deal.
This has to happen fast.
What's this?
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
And what about Big Al?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
So that's it...
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Excuse me?
Come on. Harder.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Sorry, I --
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Attractive girl.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Oh Jesus!
What is this? You guys cops or something?
Says who?
What?
I gotta go get a haircut.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Sounds respectable.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
It's bad luck.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Ten percent.
What?
A Fed? Is he close?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
Special Agent?
That's it?
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
I'll take you up on that.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
How about five hundred.
What?!
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Three years, two months. March '93.
I don't gamble.
Last hand.
How's that football story corning along?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you trying to read my palm?
How did it go?
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You were talking in your sleep.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
I've lived there.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Absolutely not.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
I'm in trouble.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
You're serious.
Wait a minute...
Is it yes?
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Hello...
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
What are you, a cop?
I was at Beadles.
Very impressive.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Does he win?
Oh. What's wrong now?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I hope it's not the oven again.
The key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
All right, then...
Check at six minutes.
Armed.
Hey, bomb.
Well of course I exist.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
And you can only do it once, right?
In a second.
Any of 'em any good?
Fred.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Not now!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Yeah.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
What the hell are you doing?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Lemme get my coat.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
I won't be staying.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
A girl.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
Playing hooky again?
Tell everybody hey.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Hey, Sketchy--
And why should she?
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
How'd you get her out of town?
Easy Sketchy.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
She was the one--
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
For a change.
Thanks, miss.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Whoa... she is a killer.
Beth? I can't believe it.
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Namely?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
One more time in English.
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
What the fuck!
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Jam, listen up.
What's gone?
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
What do you want?
Look, you can have my wallet...
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
GOOD MORNING!
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
I want to show you something.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Don't look so freaked.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
Yeah?
What happened to your neck?
That's alright... I understand.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
No. Frank.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Do you get to meet Ed?
Grandma Death.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Frank.
How so?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
I know.
Yes.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Thank you.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Her name is Gretchen.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
Christ. Is that an axe?
Wicked.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Loretta, never have kids.
Thank God for bunge cords.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
This came for you, sweetie.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I gotta work with these women.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
C'mere. I love you so much.
We was robbed.
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...
Hi...
I know.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Dakota.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
What!
We need more bars!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
But you're my father -
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
What's the matter with you?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
What do you whistle?
I don't want him.
That was for you.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You worm!
Once more! 
I don't remember.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
But -
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
You stay with me.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
This man belongs in hospital.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Romance!
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Yes.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Thank you very much.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Thank you... very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
John... Merrick
Mmmerrick.
You look splendid, John.
Thank you very much.
Good morning, John.
Yes John?
I've heard.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Watery headed bunch.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
I said welcome.
Those things in your hands.
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What was she like?
"The fifth one this week"!
I... but I...
Then I shall come too.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
I'm sure it's lovely.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
I don't suppose... no...
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Aaagh! Rape!
Why... should YOU care?
But...
Let's hack her to pieces.
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
A magic dishcloth.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Same thing, isn't it?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
You went berserk...
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
What's wrong with me?
I'm sorry.
Really?
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Sort of, um...
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Um --
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
Ready for another?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
Thanks.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
That's scary sounding.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
So, um --
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
What do you mean?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Right. Something black though.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
Yeah?
Well, you're married.
I know.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Yeah, like that.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
What are you doing?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Bye, Joel.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Oddly enough, I do.
I guess so.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Hi.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
It was snowing.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
It's them.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
How was it?
I'm sorry.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
I had a good time last night. I really did.
'kay.
That's a good one.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
It's stopped.
What?
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
He's coming?
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
How do you mean?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
It was a mutual decision.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
It's an apartment.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
But I don't know how to polka.
Is everything getting worse?
I'm staying with the Countess.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
What guy?
You're the best?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
You weren't there. I saw it.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
What happened?
What's wrong?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Does he know that?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
Justin, finish your sweep.
This is Weir.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
What's the hold up?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
That's a negative, Starck.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
Where has it been for the past seven years?
You're lying...!
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
It is now.  We're locked in.
We don't have time to fart.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
That's an affirmative.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Maybe one of the original crew?
Who?
You've got to listen...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
First time in a grav couch?
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
You got any coffee?
The safety circuit's failed!
What happened to his eyes?
What is it?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Relax, it's casual.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
Oh, he did.
I'm worried about you.
What is this? Where's Reed?
What about his first born?
He's made a few changes.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
They're ready for you, sir.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
Of course.
It's the first door on your left!
Hi, Brad.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I didn't say that.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Well...
What's wrong?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
It's definitely your mama.
Did you get her number?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Sensitive -- what is that?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Are you going to ride that wave?
I thought he was out of town.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What variables?
Well I never did it.
It was okay.
It was nice.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What do you think it is?
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
I paid for it and everything.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
What do you want?
Sometime?
Can I come in?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
You look like you could still be in high school.
Thanks. So do you.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
We keep them.
You keep them.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Are you ready to order here?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
What happened? What did they do to her?
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
What are you talking about?
When does this thing stop?
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
The cops?
You degenerate pig!
Plans?
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
The airport is over there!
May I see your license.
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
We can't risk letting them in.
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
You all sure about this?
You seem mighty collected about this.
Just an observation.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Why do you take shit from him?
Sure.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What do you mean what?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Keys.
Oh? And what's that?
I wouldn't do that, son.
I'll go with ya.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Yeah, maybe.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Get to your cars!
Oh my God... What is that?
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
Well...
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Hi Frances, got a minute?
You know what I mean.
I'm not!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Hello, Harold.
You don't think I'm good enough?
I know, but --
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
GET OUT!
Sort of.
Who?
Fired?
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
I know you believe that.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
I didn't have much to do with it.
And you think it's worth all this?
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Name?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
...Not if I can help it.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Harry.
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Serious, huh?
Is that why you did it?
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Huh?
You know something, Harry?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Frances, You're crazy.
Where to?
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I don't know.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Who's writing this guy's lines?
I'm not!
You got it.
I don't care.
Well, who have we here...?
Where are you going?
Say you promise.
Where are you going?
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
And what's that?
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
You what?
Huh?
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yes.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
I don't know.
Friend?
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Brother and sister still?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Now you've got him started.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
You can't. Death is God's will!
Yes? And?
Quite a place.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Your men are right to be afraid.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Melvin Belli.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
You want to leave?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Filmmaker.
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I'll go check on Brenda.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Somebody's there, Barry.
What the hell?
You saved my life.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
What about Neddy?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
It's just a dream.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Whassamatta?
It's beautiful...
Yeah, follow us.
I'm exhausted.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Yes.
Yes.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
No, I didn't.
Pass.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
Creepy guy.
Yes.
You're gonna let us go?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Whatsamatter?
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Start the car.
Richard!
You okay?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
What?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Where are you?
Yeah.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Really, I have no problem with --
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Pardon?
No, sir, WHAT?
Straight up?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Sir?  What did he say?
Entering my scan now...
I ain't gonna shoot her.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Yes?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh, question, ma'am.
Should probably ask him that.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
I oughtta report you.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
She's haze grey and underway...
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Jordan...
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Which is guy-speak for...
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I think you look beautiful.
"Dad."
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
O'Neil...
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Women.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I take it this file is still open.
What?
My God. He's going after the nest.
So you made it.
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Did Romeo have a name?
Wish me luck!
What's it to you?
Did you talk with Humphries?
Call me Charlie.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Not for a long time, now.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
That's right.
What are you suggesting?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
Sounds like a big company.
It's the French Secret Service.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Why do you need that?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
I think we should leave now.
How do I do that?
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
We've got to stop!
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
Yes. Good was done this .....
Shut up.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
No, wait, are you-
There is no weather in space.
Covalent... Right. So...
Right.
...Okay
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
It's Jason...
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
never doubted you for a second.
You should have let me hit him.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Stop, please! I don't know!
Simpler.
An interstellar vox.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
Hold course, Laredo!
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
The army needs you.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Misunderstood what!?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
I'm so inclined.
What are we going to do?
What's your advice, Alexander?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Let's not over do it...
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Colonel Reed...
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
They help me understand why we fight.
No, please; an advance on your salary.
You must be very rich.
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
What is it, Marquis?
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Martha... what?
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
A horseshoer?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
You know very well who it is that I love.
George, I'm sorry.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Africa, of course.
Let's get you darker!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
You get the money?
About sixty.
You gave him the money?
He's around someplace.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
I need the money.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
Karen? You okay?
I'm working on a few things.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
I don't know.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
I'm in the movie business.
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
I'm looking at you.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
You mean, Leo?
But you work for the casino?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
How? By taking my money?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Right. See how your story ends.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
You okay?
You bet.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
He already knew it.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
A passenger liner. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Fucker!
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
Maureen.
Roger.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
Did you?
What is it?
What about running number two by itself?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Or somebody stopped them.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Sounds like the hull.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Dodge to Murphy.
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
How do you mean?
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
The radio!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Morning everybody.
She was sailing up north, right?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
Epps.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Couldn't sleep.
Over the gold.
What?
Greer to Murphy.
It's funny.
Murphy, goddamit.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
We could call for help.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Say what?
What's this?
Someone from the past.
Who?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Well, yes...
I...
What do you mean?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Then why do you hate me so much?
Yeah, well --
How long have you been up?
Okay... I promise.
Much later.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
What are you talking about -- who?
It's obviously him!
This is way too creepy.
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Just promise you'll do it.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
How about this?
I know a party we could go to...
You won't believe it! Guess!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
But those are our people...
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
So should I come over?
He came into work.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Hi.
You still interested in that?
Go die, asshole!
Is this one any good?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Good luck...
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Every guy has a type!
Well are --
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
What? You're kidding me...
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
...I better not...
And you like them?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
Can you at least let me in?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
Where did you get this?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
So where would we go?
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Right, exactly!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
Then why do you stay?
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Might be exciting for you.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
What a good week.
What did I do?
Think about something else.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
What do you want with my baby?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I won't.
Hello, Peter.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
His name is Oscar.
That's where the buggy stopped.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
I command you.
You've got to do something!
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You were supposed to help me with this.
I'm Egon --
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Who?  Who?  Who?
I'm Ray --
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Ready?
Now that's one ugly dude.
Are you all right?
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Eight o'clock?
Hi, Louis.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
That's too bad.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Goodbye.
Great rehearsal.
You heard it?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
I agree.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
I've got to sleep.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
So do I.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Where are you, Pete?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Me, too.
Judgement Day ...
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
Yes?  Go on!
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
You're hearing about somebody else.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Why do you play at being drunk?
Servis made it through again?
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
I made the plume from a quail feather.
What deal?
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
What about their philosophy lessons?
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Death is a very light thing for you.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Hello.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No -- why should I?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
No.
Yes.
What's the matter?
That woman --
Where are you meeting this person?
At the Zoo.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Elaine -- I love you.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
What are you looking for?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The marble?
Are you going home?
No.
Is that so? You might marry me?
You really will?
Yes.
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Ben!
Could you bring it up?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Where are you?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Is what a girl?
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
When is he coming back?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Sit down.
Why is it?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I want to say something first.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Yes, I do.
May I have a drink?
What?
Benjamin.
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Thank you.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
You can admit that, can't you?
On your first time --
Wait a minute.
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Don't you?
Do you really want me to?
What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No we don't.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Don't tell Elaine.
Are you shocked?
And you were a student also.
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
There's nothing to tell.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Let's drop it.
What are you doing?
But if it's sickening for you --
May I stay then?
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What else?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Thank you.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
You miss the point.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Need any help?
I could take care of her.
Never?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Very little.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
And what do you do -- now?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
Bless you...
I can't.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
If we could scare up some men to play.
That was my last.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
What, Doctor?
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Stay where you are.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
No - absinthe.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
What?
Moreover...
Movies?
You...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Well -- you want me?
Of course -- of course. 
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Sorry, Preysing. 
What?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Madam will dress now, it is late.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
-- We must do something...
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
I know -- I know.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Bobo, no, I --
My son --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Permanent damage.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
You want a drink?
You know it, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Want a look?
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
Can't move.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Well, make it stop!
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
All right.
Roy Dillon.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Expecting visitors?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Just a few bucks.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
A future. The only future I've got.
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
I want to know everything about you.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Mama!
You already went back to work.
Nobody does that single-o.
Upstate.
I don't think I need it.
Yes?
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
What?
No question, huh?
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Where?
Mind if we sit down?
It's Amy Kramer.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Checking out your place.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Where are you going?
Get on the bus.
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Not me.
Can I come in?
You look kind of cold.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Shane's going as a condom.
He do that to you?
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Danny?!  Danny!
What now?!
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Samhain.
No!!!
I dunno, boy.
A bitch.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
You know what gets me?
Go home!
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I forget mine for years on end.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
You invited me.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Anybody home?
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Where's Mom?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Dad?
What's this?
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
I'm engaged.
How do you do?
Not at all.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Nothing would please me more.
You used to like it stark!
Now--turn around, if you would.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
I don't think so.
Why not?
Sneaking in the back door.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
He cried.
Rifle?
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
We have, have we?
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
Correct.
You hope.
Poison.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
Get up.
You didn't even find that out?
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
That is sad.
Ja?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
That's an interesting piece of news.
Who have you been talking to?
Is Norbert still here?
Really?
We don't have a maid any more.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
He isn't?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
The park!
What's the matter now?
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
They didn't murder me.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Not true.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Phooey.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.
You're still dressed?
Hello. You want some information?
That's all you got, three girls?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Overpowering?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Three hundred?
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
When do we start?
I thought you were going to bed?
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
At least I'm a growing person.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
'Sucking off.'
No.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
But it's all you do.
Tijuana.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
I can stop if you want.
But what?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Well, what do they know?
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
I don't know.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I'm only human, you know.
What happened, pilgrim?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Where does he hang out?
Where's Ratan?
What exactly do you have in mind?
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
Huh?
To his own daughter?
You working in San Diego now?
No.
Could I see your registration?
Your tree.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
How interesting.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
What do you want?
What do you see?
Here's your shovel.
I don't know.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Do you dance?
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Yes.
My door is always open.
Harold?
Yes. Very much.
What happened?
Look, the ice is melting.
What's that?
No more revolts.
Yes.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Well, why don't you?
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you advance on me.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Do you think there is any life up there?
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
Yes. It does.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Huh?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
Yes.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
It's coming.
I knew you'd come back.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
What's the matter with her?
What?
What are you talking...
Then why are you here?
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
See? I don't like that --
What is it?
Do you believe in hell?
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
I thought you liked being on TV.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
You call that thing a cigar??
Whatcha looking at, John??
Myers??? How's your arm?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Pardon?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Who are you?
No time for argument.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Poor baby.
Frank --
But you said --
What happened to you?
A box?
What kind of doors?
So you were cheated.
You can't love him.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
No. I'm not.
What have you done?
I'm going to throw up.
Huh?
I... suppose so, yes.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
Kirsty?
Well come over, will you? See the place?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Sure.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
It's late.
She's so damn... English.
Oh no?
Steve. Thank God you came.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
What's next?
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Yeah.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
What?
Ehh.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
No way.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Well what about the new Echo --
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
Anna.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Oh.  Okay.
Is there a difference?
Is that it?
What's his name?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Hey Charlie.
Hey Rob.
Good weekend?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Fine.
Let's not.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Well we rang $900 today.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Yeah.  Great.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I guess.
Hello.
Are you still in love with me?
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
You know I'm a good person.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Want to know what, exactly?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
I mean it.
No.  Probably not.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
So?
Rob here.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Enough, Liz.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
So you'll stay?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
And after that?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
I'm Vince.
Nice.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
No.
-Okay okay.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
It's not mine.
I've been to Church Hill.
No.
You are being foolish.
Is this what you killed them with?
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
I see.
I'm not even sure why.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
He knows about you.
You kill with your left hand?
No!
You have lived forever.
Now there's a new topic.
I'm calling an attorney.
Four?
What makes you so sure he's the one?
What's all of this got to do with me?
Good way to lose your job.
Your name is Conor?
Aye.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
I did at that.
Yes.  Always.
I don't know why.
I don't understand.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
It is the truth.
This can't be.
Aye.
How can I stop such a man?
Me arm hurts.
We need more time.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Where!
Spare a chair?
How are you?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
He found us even there.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
It doesn't.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
Where were you Tuesday night?
His only kid.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
But --
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Get out!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
How long is what?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
I have a lunch date. I just want --
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Please! Will you just --
Where'd you meet this man?
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Then what does he want with you?
Now you got me.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Now you're talking!
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
I get it!
Huh!
What tickets?
I'm finished.
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Ring that number, will you?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Flip a coin.
Hildy!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Thanks.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
Hildy, darling!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Who do you want?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
How much?
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
I'll call.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
Just one second --
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
We'll fix that, too. 
What?
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I won't.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Any news?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Come on with that money!
You know it is!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
How'd you get here, Earl?
What do you want?
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
Get out of here!
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Look out!
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
What's that?
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
I never was.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Bugger off.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
What is it?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
And where do you think you're going?
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
We did the decent thing.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Ma, Tiny's in.
Who's your Daddy!
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Hey, great they're back.
I was just wondering.
Now, what makes you think that?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Yeah, no shit.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
I gotta open the gate.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
What?
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Huh?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
What are you laughing at?
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Recover any bodies?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
No, just a little too old.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Well hello, officer.
Fit the profile?
Jesus Christ.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Say my name.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Of course not.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Oui.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
No.
My apologies, madam.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Won't he be able to tell?
Yeah?
No. I married a midget.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
I'm going to miss you.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
You are a therapist, right?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
So, how's it going today?
Of course not.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Have you?
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yahoo!
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Check!
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
For whom and for what?
Could be.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Do you really think you can beat him?
How much do I owe you?
I lost twenty bucks.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Thanks for the drink.
For me.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
I been thinking.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Where?
Well, we won't.
I don't know.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
I'm a businessman, kid.
The expensive kind.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Fast and loose, man.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Gimme ten bucks.
Have a nice trip?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Who is it?
What happened?
Is that what makes a winner?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Oh, I don't know.
Leave now.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Go on back to the hotel.
California. Oakland.
Hundred dollars?
Your shot.
You lived like this once.
Shhh... don't talk.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
I surrender --
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
You built things.
We're going to be moving, son.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
Are you all right, Dad?
I had an awful dream.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
No.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
I'd believe him.
No.
Your father asked you a question.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
It's really nice of you to help us.
Better be. You left me for him.
You saved a lot of lives.
What's the bad news?
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Spunky?
College nickname.
You try Martin?
This I can see.
And our forces?
How're we doing?
And our troops here?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
That's impossible...
Be careful.
You're late.
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
They let you out?
How' he doing?
But, Mr. President...
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes.
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
My reputation precedes me.
All my life!
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Yes. Now we know.
Schneider?
Are you expected?
Where did this come from?
I'm through!
I usually don't.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
What do you know about this place?
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
What final challenge?
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Now, who are all these people?
Uh-huh.
Then we'll die.
All right! Where's my father
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Interested in local curios?
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
That was a misunderstanding.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Lao She.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
You don't look very good.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
What?!
PET IT??!!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
Couldn't keep away, huh?
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
So now they believe me.
Al.
What is your name?
Why don't we go home?
Do me a favor, Al.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Right.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
What for?
Calm Down! Act rational.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Thanks.
I don't like the sound of that.
What does it say.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
What do you mean?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
They'll know who I am.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Eating sushi?
Eat it.
...Joe.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Much too blue.
What did that cost?
They both look good to me.
I don't know what's going on.
Joe, be careful!
Not her. You!
It's not your time. I get time off.
You been had. We have.
Bingo.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
One of your instincts?
I can't see a thing.
He hung us up dry.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Are you alright?
Keep thinking.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
What are you doing?
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
**?!! 
Sir?
That crazy guy?
Enough ROmance.
We're here.
I will?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Do what?
What way?
As if your mind's not all there.
You are.
Who do you work for?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
He must be a good friend.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
What is it?
You don't believe me.
Oh sure.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Chiang Cho?
Can you?
I can't fly it.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
Why did you, then?
Why not, what are you going to do?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Kiss her you fool.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Yes.
The other working.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hi, Daddy.
I'll take some.
What's that outside, Daddy?
That remote control thing?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Do you want more rice?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
What the hell are you doing?
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
No, I'm not...
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
Okay. 
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Hey, Lowell.
Okay.  Lowell?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
Use the bathroom.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Thank you, Bob.
No classes this morning?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
Jeffrey Wigand...
Yeah...
Area code 212-555-0199.
That's right...
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Hardly new news.
Who are these people?
I disappeared on you?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Who's that?
Hello. You there
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Why?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Yeah, great.
What?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You manipulated me into this...!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
You try and have a good time.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Right.
You're gonna get your fix...
"I would bet on it."
It acts as a drug on the body?
Baby. You are so HOT!
You did good, Massey!
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Who do you want me to kill?
Grounds?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
He's the wrong man.
Thanks, buddy.
I have it.
You just haven't met the right person.
Gotcha.
Oh, for the love of...
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Marylin! Listen to me.
But why him?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
No. Don't stop.
Is that you?
No.
Friends?
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
I have a surprise for you.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
May I come in?
STUFF.  Got a light?
Those are gifts.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
You're not...
Herb wants to see me?
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
And she has...?
What are they?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
What...?
Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
I'll get it annulled.
Ridiculous!
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
Is that his name?
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
What do you think you're doing!
Huh?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Driver!
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
I found it on the seat.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Your ego is colossal.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
You've got a name, haven't you?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Here—
Where is the shower?
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Santa Claus?
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
It takes money to buy food.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
was—but—
What are you thinking about?
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What for?
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Congratulations.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
Not interested. 
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
The old man's screwy!
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
What's the thousand bucks for?
Huh?
Send it collect.
Who?
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Then—you'll have to git !
There's a seat over there for you.
Why—no—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
What do you think, Lou?
You know you keep saying that.
What's the other name?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Calm down, Dave, what?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
No.
Dad, look what I drew.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
I'm not sure I understand.
Nonsense.  What next?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
For sexual purposes?
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
The Warren Commission call him?
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Six.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
And you didn't tell the Police?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Can I have a word with you?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You don't want much, do you?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Shit.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
He's the one who wants you.
Cash poor?
You get a chance to use it?
He called you?
How do you feel about getting old?
My ass ain't the same.
What'd ya see?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Does it happen to all men?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
I called you last night.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
The feds. It's evidence.
What if he checks it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
How'd you find out?
Set him up.
Less ten percent.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I'm just tired in general.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
I'm recording this.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
Not yet.
She told you that?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
But you didn't do that.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Sure.
Killian's.
You already knew that?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
What the hell you doin'?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
It's true, isn't it?
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Uh-huh.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Man, I don't like that part.
She don't know shit about the money.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
I can sit through it once.
Susanville.
Two months shy of four years.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Were you a disco girl?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
With Ordell?
Must of made quite an impression.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Thanks, Baby.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Who was Beaumont?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Pretty sure.
In the chest and stomach.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Came outta where?
Tell me.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Was she?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
She got off, huh?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
This place stinks.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
My money's in that office, right?
Uh-huh.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
He ain't here right now.
Take me home.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Just to see you. That's all.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
How do you know?
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Daddy!
You have an unusual hand.
I could have told you that.
There was a bang.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
You need ... a doctor.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
But the paper ...
What do you mean, demons?
... I've seen them, too.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
What? By myself?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Hell, you think I am?
What was that?
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Who did?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
You up?
I don't know.
Thanks.  What's that?
I don't let anybody call me that.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
What do you mean you can see?
I don't like things that make you cry.
Ready?
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
Why do you bring her up?
You okay?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
He's coming right over.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Am I home?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
He said you didn't have one.
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
It might be for me.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Oh?  Where you going?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where are they?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Oh God!
Goddamn you!
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
The Ladder?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
I can't move.
Just relax.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
I no from around here.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
You got a nice tan, though.
Clear the area. This is an order!
He'll never make it.
I'm awake?
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Nothin' much.
Count 'em on one hand.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know what to do.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
The army?
What's that?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Sergeant!
What?!
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
Shit!
It bought us some time.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Jesus what the hell is that?
My job.
Yllo, what's your head count?
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Not a chance.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Okay, good tip.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
That's really funny.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Now that's just gross.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Later.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Kay-em you okay?
Leave him behind!
I'm sending you the files.
Nanotechnology.
Azrael can you repeat that?
You're not going anywhere.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
You got it.
You got it.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
What about us?
Have you ever had one do this?
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Michael! Come inside!
You too, sweetheart...
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
Got a pen on you?
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
Who are you?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
What is all this stuff?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
I didn't know her.
You here for the summer?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Do I set the goddam hook?
You love sharks?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Um, hi?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Yeah. That was me.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Yup.
Yup.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Wow, dream big!
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Viscera?
What do you play?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Yeah.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You know... it's parts...
What is it?
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
I actually know this one.
You do?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Nothing...
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
She answered our prayers.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Have you found a place to stay?
Are you takin' the pictures?
...Yeah.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I'm cool.
Do what?
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Shush, Adele.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey mostly.
Tight fit.
How much do I owe you?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Dahlia, no.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
I still think we should have met them first.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Carrie.
How do you know that?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
What happened?
Where would we find him?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
Shit.
78th.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Who?
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
That.
What are you talking about?
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Casper.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
You sure?
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
What?
Yeah. Come on.
At the block party?
Tonight?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
How do you know?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Because, you know why. You know.
Dance!
What?
Come dance.
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Yeah?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Passion...
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Yep.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
You think so?
I hate 'em.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
It was... it was.
What man? What is it?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
What?
You're a lying bastard!
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Why not?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Please... wait.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
What's this?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He was watching you.
You must be Erica.
Is your dad here?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
I'm busy right now.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Where were you last night?
Answer the question.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
You're always in the middle of a match.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Relax.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
No.  You were talking about chess.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I'm hungry.
What do you want on it?
Nothing.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
You don't understand.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
You choose these?
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
I chose the wrong passage.
They can be saddled.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Go. I command you.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
You do?
I'm hungry.
I only want one.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Put me down, you lout!
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He will not!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
You were attacked in the forest?
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
It is the time.
She has the power of vision.
Look.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
No?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Rocket launcher.
Good! First shot!
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Why?
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
A little...
It's too big.
Risky business, isn't it?
I love you so much, Leon.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Huh? That's smart!
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh, that's good!
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
What is it?
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
It's a special day isn't it?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
He's plastered.
I know where my heaven is.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
What did they ask?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
It has to be a full character's name.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
What, come on?
I do.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
I don't have kids.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Are you working?
Don't run away.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I like it here with you.
Let's stay for a while.
How'd this happen?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
But it's a top three school --
Is he always such an ass?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What?!
You have Stromwell.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Up for a celebration dinner?
Almost.
Neither.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
I completely agree.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
That's not entirely --
East coast people are different.
No, silly. I go here.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Is it a Kappa?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
There he is!
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
You go?  Not watch fun?
You go to lady now?
Grotesque... monstrous...
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
What was that?  Did you hear that?
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
No, wait... please... listen...
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
I fear she's lost.
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Damn them!
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Good.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
Why not mine the damned walls?
What magic have we on our side?
Will you chance a miss?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Can't we move any faster?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Where?
Barely living, from the looks of it.
We seek to undo the curse.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Never.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Jack!
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
I don't want it on me.
My lady mocks me.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'd be honored.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
What do we do now?
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
How came you by this blade?
Simple as that, eh?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Marco!
Dad's disappeared!
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
And video games after!
Mom said I should.
Mom?
He must.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
He's a freak.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I'm coming in.
Why are you so stupid?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
And if I enclosed it?
It's thirty feet.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Right...she married...what was he?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
Why?
I don't know.
You'll have money when you work.
When are you going to be back?
I'm not even listening.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
Hi, Alyssa.
I wish you had told me then.
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Why wouldn't she leave?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Ah!  Oh....
She's a little sad, is all.
Why would they tow your truck?
Why call me?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
I don't have a phone.
George --
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I better get the kids home.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
Should I?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Sharp.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
No, tell me what's so funny.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Guess we better get going, huh?
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
What ain't there?
No.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I said you're soft.
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
What is that?
You got your own nightclub?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
He's from New York City. That one, too.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
What are you doing here, mama?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Wait for the firemen!
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Where'd you get this?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
That's what I thought!
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
I'll call her later.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
How did you see me?
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
This is baloney!
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
No. This can't be happening.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Hey...
By she, do you mean he?
What's with that guy?
This don't look good.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You followed him?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Why are you laughing?
Valerie?
I think I'm floating.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Do me.
A black guy?
Hey...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Just the face.
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
And?
Curious.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
It's different now. Help me.
And then you killed him, right?
Please? What friends?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Well? How do you like it?
Good... You up for a drive?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Very strange.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?
Pornos.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
You killed him.
Where's the bathroom?
Dick Laurent?
Better.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
We saw you that night, Pete.
Repeat that, Bill.
Where is he now?
Who is this man?
I won't ever tailgate.
There's no other bedroom?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
At your house.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
What night?
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Was there?
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
I can see that.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
It'll be ready.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
What?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Fossils.
I'm a paleontologist.
A paleontologist.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
I beg your pardon.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Have I?
Certainly not.
The police?
Yes.
Yeah. You know.
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Well, that's that, I guess.
It's unbelievable.
Say, what about that gold deal?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Well, it must have taken–
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Well, is it?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Please let me help you.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
Father Perrault is dead.
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
Mine?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Yes.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
What's it mean?
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
What are you talking about?
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
George, what do you think you're doing?
Porters?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Oh, George . . .
Yes, everything!
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
I guess we're in for it.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm thirty.
What is?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
I was just going to.
Why, mother?
Go? Where?
Cowan--
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Actually, sir--
I'd go with number three.
I wasn't scared...
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
We'll take it from here.
What?  Who the hell are you?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Looks like a train ticket.
How does that help me?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What are you doing?
No.
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
How could it not?
Goodwill...
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Actually, yeah--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
And they're buying it?
They went right to the President.
Yeah?  What's up?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Drop some money.
Please --
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Where are we going?
And replace them with new ones.
It's all I could safely move.
They were performance pieces.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
I'm fine.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
No doubt.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Yes.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
Are these all of her previsions?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Stop --
What the hell.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
But you have to.  They said you would.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
The what?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
It's insanity around here.
I thought you were retiring?
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
There a maid in this hotel?
I don't know, why?
I don't have any sugar either.
To what?  Trap him?
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
You're Bobby, right?
Snifter are for warm drinks --
All the suites are about the same.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
Manhattan.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
What's wrong, baby?
Uncle Bobby?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Mommy's not home?
Honey?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Oh my god. What happened?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Ho's a good guy --
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
When's it going down?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Ruiz tied in out there?
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
You want --
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Where is the Soho Grand?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
So?
So, it was a draw.
We look good this year.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
It's not even yours.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I'll get the girl.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
You sure?
Who you calling?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
Nothing else.
How'd they know who you were?
Motherfucker...
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
What did I 'get?'
About what?
Back in.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You got that right.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
Put that shit out...
Let's check out the penguins.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Calm down.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Dude, we were practically made...
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Excuse me.
It means you got a gun?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
So you're our own private guy?
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Thanks.
Keys.
I get it.
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Did you just now con me?
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
What you say?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Don't con me. Don't try...
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
What can I do for you?
What?
I see your point.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
Are you?
It won't be easy.
I'll be away a lot.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
We need you too!
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Did you see the papers today?
"His greatest greatness."
I say a lot of things.
And like a fool I believe it.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
She know?
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
I ain't stupid.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
What does Sidney say?
Let me die then.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
You the man.
You had the number.
Fine as May wine.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
So what do I get in return?
[Who killed her? You?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[What do you mean?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Please, don't...]
[Don't lie to me!]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
How long you staying, Crease?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
The United States.
Hmmm?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
Where's my mother?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
You got that right.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Creasy... Wait.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has to go, Samuel.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It will be a hard break.
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Who you gonna call?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
When was this?
Marty.
Your son Marty?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
Oh, I'm fine.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
Tommy...
Wadda you so sore about?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Yes, O'Reilly?
Home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
But what about Major Houlihan?
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
No, no, that one.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
All of them?
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Same here.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Of course not.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
You're asking for somebody else?
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
They missed the boat.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
There's only one worth noticing.
I have not understood what you means.
The blonde dish.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
What's going on? Who started this?
You mean who hit who?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Sir?
Never mind.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Uh-huh . . .
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Thirty dollars.
Oh.
A deal?
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Have you seen him?
Where is she?
What do they want?
Help yourself.
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Who's got him?
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Join the John Doe Club.
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
What are you doing up here then?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
I know one way you can do it.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Don't make do it, Mike.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Tell me what's wrong.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Who are you again?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Where did you hear that?
Yes.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
He's got the girl.
What the fuck is going on.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Is the hostage injured?
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Please. I'm begging you.
If you did, you never showed it.
Yeah that's it.
It's very nice.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scott...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Tell him to give me a raise.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
Yeah, they are but...
This is Halden.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
Okay...
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
It's all here...
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
He had keys.
One condition.
Who did he digitize?
Someone you have to get back to?
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
I know.
Sorry?!
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Because you'll never believe me.
Program name?
Access granted.  Male or female?
Male.
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Wow.  Sand.
Release the power with the power.
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
You okay?
And how do we release the power?
Simon says...
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
But I've never served a day.
Poor, yeah.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
So what happened?
When my money moves, I go with it.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
It's a mask.
Would it be painful for you?
I'm doin' business here!
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
Like Don Maranzano.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
The Big Picture.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Kill them! Kill them!
You're fuckin' crazy.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Olive or eyeball?
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Back? You're sending me back?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
What's the matter?
You're really gonna pop the question?
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Who?
What's the matter?
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
<u>What</u> union?
What?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
Uh-huh?
You know ...  ... whoops!
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
... Oh ...
You mean it's dangerous?
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
But it *isn't*?
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
"There's more light here," he says--
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Good idea. When?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
No--not offhand--
Susan? Nah!
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Sam Foley--dead!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Dinner, Hubert.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
What!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
A dirty frame!
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Washington!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Mr. President!
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Mr. President--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Oh, now--
Fine--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
Is--is something the matter?
Most natural thing in the world!
Convene?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Punch?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
A *day*!
Yes, I see that.
What?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Must have been tickled pink.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Don't mention it--
Saunders--!
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
And how's your bill, Senator?
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
How's that, buddy?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
I know that.
Susan!
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
You're the best nurse I can think of--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
What do you mean?
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
You won't stand for it?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
You can't say *that* to--
Maybe he won't get up.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Father--oh.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Are they true!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
What's that got to do with it?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
I enjoy it.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Let's just walk, okay?
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
A girl?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Did it?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
With pay!  She is out the door.
What's bothering you, huh?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
John—
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
How's it going? Okay?
How is this, sir?
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
I can't find him.
Look!
Yes?
How do you do.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
No?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Nah.
Have a drink?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
No.
Proceed.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Binge?
Farmer?
South Dakota north.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Yes, sir.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Really? You think so?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
Mr. Cook.
What's that?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
I see.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
You find it distasteful, don't you?
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
Go to hell.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
What?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.
It was Henry Follett.
How long you been in this town?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
Okay.
Sure.
Got a license?  But no car?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
I'm trying.
What's wrong with her?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Is that when you split up?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
I guess you saw the show...?
Sofie...
But...
What?
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
It's my bit for the community.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
Was it something that happened at school?
Uh-huh.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Can I ask you a personal question?
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Uh-huh.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Just you.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Sounds like you have several.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
No... no training.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
When?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
C'mon, friend.
Why do you like to fight so much?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
Two hundred pounds.
You swear?
What did you find? What did you see?
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Have you no respect for the dead?
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
She's my sister, actually.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
It must have slipped my mind.
I thought you were done?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
We could really use some coffee --
How about... the Savage Six?
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Hi.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Yeah.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
I admire you.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
I just want to be a superhero.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
You drink too much.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
What are you talking about?
Have you ever seen him?
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's a big difference.
Nah.
The who?
So where's the art?
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
We're superheroes.
Mother... it's not what you think!
But... the silverware?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Sorry.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Are you serious?
Cavalry?
There are none here.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Who is there?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Read it back.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Ajaccio.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Impossible, I don't believe it.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
Oh...?
Thank you.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
When is she supposed to return?
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
I cannot promise you that.
All right -- I promise.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
Yes.
I wrote it.
You wrote it.
I know.
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Yeah.
Well, let me in.
You paid cash?
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
It's about to work, just come on.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
What's crackin'?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Man, this a cool house.
Just a little.
I walked.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Here I come!
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
20 minutes?
Where's Craig?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
What?
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Hey, what's going on?
'Take your car?'
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Elroy.
Don't remind me.
You were very nervous.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
I would also like to apologize.
For not believing you.
Could I see some identification, sir?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Yes, yes, I understand.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
I want'to talk to her.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Ready?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
You remember me?
What are you supposed to do?
Who?
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Gimme a dollar.
Laughs.
I've done much better ones than this.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Get moving.
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Only you.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
You swore, Pearl!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
Where's Mom?
Where are we goin', John?
John?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Yes. Yes.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I don't know nothin'!
Nothin'. 
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Why, pray tell?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Our honeymoon.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
She took them kids with her?
You'll whip me!
You believe in anything?
Okay?
No.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Much better.
You do?
How you plan to do that?
What?
You used me, daddy!
Just want to talk to him a second.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
She lived there.
Did you sleep?
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
I must be going nuts...
And then what happened?
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
I have nothing to hide.
An evening gown.
What is it, Anna?
Just for the honeymoon.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Your breakfast, monsieur.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
No, sir.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
A week?
A cow?
What's new?
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
What's that?
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Business.
Private.
Oh no. No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Why should I take a chance?
On what?
You, please.
Gladly.
At what intervals does he whistle?
In other words you don't know.
Can I help you?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
So that is your house?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Yes.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
And what do you do for mankind?
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
Oh, let it ring.
I must go.
You know I want to...
Then do it through my lawyer!
Must one always be after something?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
What?
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
Not funny, huh?
You see? Life can be so simple.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
No... go on.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
You must, darling.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No! No!
Much happier.
Radio! What is radio?
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Did you win?
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
You haven't seen her yet?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
We have nothing to discuss.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
May I have your bags, madame?
Yes, it does.
No.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Yes... leaving immediately.
I don't understand.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
At Père Mathieu's.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
To protect his people.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Mitchell?
Pay him.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Who?
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Their fourth!
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Yes, you approved it, sir.
But what are we paying him for?
"Security" is not strong enough.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
Where are they?
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
We really must go, Mr. President.
What?
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Are you tapping Kissinger?
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Oh, my goodness ...
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
There's no other choice.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
I like jazz ...
Elvis I like, too.
Bernstein.
Sir?
That's right.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate.  Grateful.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It's over, Dick.
I want a divorce.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Yeah ... I'm out.
Were you planning to tell me?
Buddy? ...
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Because ... I have to relax.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Tomorrow.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How you been, Ellis?
That man that shot you died in prison.
Nineteen zero and nine.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
None of that explains your man though.
Well what would you call him.
Nothin'?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
It could be.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
I mean, would you care to join me.
I need to know that.
Big talk.
Just keep it up.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
What should I do?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
What's this about?
Huh? What is...
I don't know.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
You know she won't be there.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Is somethin' wrong?
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Everything.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Well enough.
The what?
Could I get another room.
Another additional.
Half.
...But that won't last.
Sugar?
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
Yes.
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
No I don't have it.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Are you in the service?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Yeah?
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You must be joking.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
...I... I know what you are.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
...what're you saying?
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Yes, ma'am.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Yes, she is.
What happened when you were twelve?
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Sure you don't want any salad?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
I got you, Del...
Uh-huh.
What're you doing here, Roy?
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
What's the matter here?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
He has no heartbeat!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
It's something I had to do. For David.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
...this is your sweater, right?
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Huh?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
We can live with that.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
Where? Where is she?
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
What doesn't?
I never said that I believed...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Very graceful. Perfect form.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Jesus Christ!
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
No... before that.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
David Ravell.
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
You can't do this -
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
That's not my ring.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Pete... I do apologize.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
I am. Hur you?
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
It was a powerful air.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Daddy!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
Okay, okay. You win.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Why?
I wrote. Not every week...
I never said any of that!
Yes, Joe.
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
What's your name, boy?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
I'm a little late, that's all.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
What do you mean?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I'll get it if you want.
Hi.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
-- posed to mean?
Bullshit.
Not that one.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Asshole.
Pure idiot.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Be quiet.
They're coughing.
They're gonna die in there!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Huh?
That door is a safely hazard.
A what?
Cut it back a little bit.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
What?
The furniture guy?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Can't hear a thing.
Oh, please.
I am.  I'm here.
Morse code?
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
What are you doing?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
Call Dad!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
I'm sorry, Mom.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Tyrone...
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
What the fuck?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
What's with you?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
We need money first...
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
I don't know.
I don't know about that.
Brimmer.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
No.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
You got salt last week.
I know that.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Is it?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
You know how old I am.
You know what happened.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
I stand corrected.
Balderdash!
And your principles?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
But father, they might come this way.
Well...I guess not.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
But don't you dare say that.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
God, that's fine.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Almost there, Louis.
I guess so...but...
Don't worry about that.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
She's finally asleep.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
How does he do that?
Elizabeth goes free!
That's right.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
I'll watch my back.
No, I really think I do.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Did he speak?
I can't breathe.
You're speaking up for him again?
What?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
I know the code.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
You?!
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Raise the sails.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Agreed.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
What's that?
Depends.
Jack!
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Speak.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
No, thank you.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Why are there two ottomans?
Icarus?
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
A man?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Is that what Argon told you?
You're afraid of him.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Susan!
Been out for six months now.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Yeah, we'll see.
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
Why do we need it?
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
What's that supposed to mean?
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
Probably the caffeine.
Do you have something to bring me down?
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
What did you want my hair for?
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Who is he?
You didn't think I could just leave you?
You're not going after Argon!
You!  I remember you!
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Yeah, and what might that be?
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
And you have him?
Icky!
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Will you step into the library?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
A little—? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Of course I am Stewart.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
No? What do you look upon her as?
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Come on, get going, get going!
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Well!
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
My error.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
What did he want?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
Thanks. May I sit down?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
And you struck him right here in our house—?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Heavens! The man's insane!
But I—
Did you call, sir?
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
Yes.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
What?
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Oh, hello Betty.
It's alright. Let me see.
I told you where I was.
All night?
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You want to get out of here?
But where would we go?
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
No. Of course not.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
It was accessible to everyone.
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
What do you mean!?
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Oh my God.
We're supposed to be in school.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
They don't have that kind of potential.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
It's okay.
The pages filled in?
What?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Yeah.
Where are they?
Scout?
Right. And how did she dress him?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Where are you going ...
BUD.
I had nothing to do with that.
Look ...
No you're not.
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah ...
Yeah ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Forget about that!
Aren't you a little early?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Yeah but what are you doing?
And what was this?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
That's it.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
That's your fault not mine.
Yeah I can't.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
What?
I....please don't do this.
Tell me why.
Are you watching a porno movie?
....no....
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
You sound very cute, very nice.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
No.
You're going to work now?
Can I ask you a question?
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
....what....?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I need help.
I don't have a girlfriend --
It was cool last night.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Do you know them.
-- well, if you're gonna go --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Ok.
How long have you known her?
No, no. I did.
....No....
Is everything ok?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
You don't think you'll go --
This is Lena.
Ok.
Hello?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
It's so nice.
Do you wanna have sex?
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
I'm fine are you ok?
What is this?
You left me at the hospital.
You can't do that.
For what?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
What do you mean?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your Social Security number.
You want her to call you Jack?
How many sisters do you have?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Where you been?
Wait a minute --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Yes.
You have another house somewhere or something?
You can't just stay in your house.
I know.
Ok.
Don't puss out.
That's cool.
So...did my brother call you?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
He's a writer, not a madman.
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
Coulmier, you animal!
NEVER!
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Of course.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
It was fiction, of course.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll pass the word on, then.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
...yes, I've got that bit...
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Of course.
Good God, Marquise --
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Not you too
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Sure you can, just--
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Do you?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
There is nothing to discuss-
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You will not walk out on me
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Sir, I-
Huh?
Showing life
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Yes.
Please don't say this.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Let me out.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
I'll hire you  -- right now-
He'll destroy us.
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
How?
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
It's 350 pages long.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
I want you back
Did I ever tell you about my father?
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
Mank!
Shit
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
It came.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
This is an abomination There's no music and--
Well it' s all you've got !
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
No, we're jake. But listen-
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
How 'bout a real drink?
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
What's up, Colonel?
Sure. What is it?
You want me to do what?
Jack! Enough!
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
How do you know? You know her that good?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Huh?
You wasn't with her?
You want us to wait for you?
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
But you said "you."
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
What time is it?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
No.
Jake...
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
What's the matter with you?
I went out.
Where you been all day?
I went to the movies.
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Why don't you just call him up?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Why don't you just call him?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Excuse me for living.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
Oh. When are they expected home?
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Your Lisa?
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Like an old hambone?
Where?
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
She's only perfect.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
Keep your mind off her.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
He and his wife splitting up?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
No.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Mrs. Doyle?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
What a day I've had!
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Of course not.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Tell me about it.
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Yeah.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
What's the apartment house number?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
I don't know.
Thinking about Thorwald?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
We have all -- what?
I have the whole weekend off.
From his landlord -- once a month.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
But you're not?
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Chelsea 2-5598.
A new disease.
What?
Machismo?
Just him.
Jim Stark.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Shoot, Jimbo.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Will you let him tell it!
You're absolutely right!
Except yourself!
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
He's home.  I heard the car.
Are you going down there?
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Frank!
What?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
What?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Judy.
I don't want you for my father!
Here.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
Pretty mixed up?
Plato!
Hi.  I saw you before.
Where what was.
Dig the square wardrobe!
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Neither can I.
Why?
You can trust me, Judy.
Well--we're newlyweds.
No!
We have to go back!
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
That one?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
What are you doing here?!
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
I've been doing good, though.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
No --
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Nick, no --
Nick, I love you --
Get the hell off of me!
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
You told him about Nick's letters.
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Nick, the ice is --
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
They all are. Football's on.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
But I never said Rudy.
You... you don't know me --
So you could get down her chimney.
Where's she work?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What'd they call her in high school?
So what the hell good are you...
Why not.
Don't tip.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Nnn... nothing...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
No.
Six men means six guns.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
What about the Powwow Safe?
How long ago was your makeover?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
Hell you haven't.
Hot chocolate.
What?
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
POP! That was My card!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Start talkin
That's what it looks like!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Yes.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Bullshit.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
It's a change.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Mr. Blue's dead?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Don't ask me that.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Nope.
Aren't you?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
No real people?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I don't know anybody.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Who shot who?
Anybody hurt?
What's the matter with her?
He's learning his letters.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
What?
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
How'd you happen to miss?
That's right, Steve.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Kind of sore.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
I'm sorry. Let's go.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Stop it -- stop it.
You got no business snoopin' around --
That sure smells good.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Goodbye and thanks.
We don't want to go there.
Maybe I better start working on him.
I said let's go.
Aren't we stayin'?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Well, Steve?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
No, I won't let you do it.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
No. I never date outside my race.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh.
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Are you okay?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
This can't be happening?
Noooo!!!
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
We? What do you mean... we?
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
You could use the grade, huh?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Oh.
Did you do that?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Got a problem with that?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
Let me help you.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
You're not wearing a belt.
It's okay. I understand.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Oh, boy! 
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Chip, honey?
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Oh Mom...
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
You mean for TV or print?
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
That's nice.
No woman would!
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
No, I don't.
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
It's him!
You got your wish.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
You think my sister is there?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I don't like this.
Let's get out of here.
We can't stand here all night.
Drink.
Yes.
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
I haven't got that much in cash.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She's a pretty good sort.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
I ought to know.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No. She asked about the trademark.
But you have treated me that way.
A job?
The people at the restaurant?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
I'm going to find your sister.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Well?
I don't know.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
Please, Jacqueline.
Good-bye.
And you knew he'd be here.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I understand.
I've lost my knack.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I'd forgotten.
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Is it about Jacqueline?
I'm very, very serious.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Because I have something very important to do.
What?
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
You mean like "time flies"?
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
No.
So what about kids?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
Impotent.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Of course not.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
What kind of personal project?
You just ask them questions?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Yes.
Why not?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
Can't.
Her name was Elizabeth.
How come?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
And you feel the same way with John?
But if you were?
I can't.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
I want to touch you.
I'm not either!!
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
I have thought about it, yes.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
No, I haven't.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Lose something?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
I don't want to talk about it.
What kinds of questions?
You don't know that for sure.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Here it is.
It looks like a tablecloth.
I get real busy between two and four.
No, I touched me.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
She still is.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Yes.
No.
No.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Could be risky.
Hello.
Hello.
Do you want me to stop calling?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
What do you mean?
Did he put you up to this?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
No.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
John Millaney.
Yes?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Another kiss?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
NIGHT NIGHT
You bet, Bert.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
How did you come by this scenario?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
He was a President.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER

He was adopted you know.
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
But they only think they're happy.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
Isn't she lovely?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
So what's up?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
You got it.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Two years ago, buddy.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
I can explain.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
This is rose, right?
Sure I know Maya.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
How do you know?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Aye-aye, captain.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Pull yourself together, man.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
We were supposed to play golf.
Right now.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What? Of course I like Christine.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
It's private.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Hrnrnrn?
Yep. Quite a day.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
What are you drinking?
Nice. Very nice.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
What was the bottle that did it?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
About two-thirty.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
So what's happening with your book?
About a year.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Oops. Sorry.
What are you thinking about?
Does she ever answer back?
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
No I'm not.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
It's noise.
I can feel air.
These are D's; I need double A's.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Don't call me Father.
It's not broken.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Where were you?
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
You must have known that before you came.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
They got a saloon there?
He is that.
I understand.
Yeah?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Why?
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
New record.
You wanted to see me?
I'm done talking. Get out.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
You're kidding.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Because they enjoy it.
You've got a legitimate job.
You got a place to stay?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
What is it that I can't figure?
That was my plan.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Okay -- for you.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
Spare me.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
What about it?
Even the fall from the plane?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Everyone you know is lying.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Hello?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Of course.
... so much like her?
Who are you really?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
How will you do our love scenes?
Hal, what are you doing?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I'm sorry.
I've seen them all before.
"Straw God" changed my life.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
How?
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Do I know you?
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
It's a yacht.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Hi.
You mean they buy it?
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
--My God.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
How do you draw now?
You want to ask me a question?
Where should I look then, Cole?
I didn't know you were funny.
Dr. Crowe.
...No.
I told you what I want.
You weren't a paper champion.
Just help.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You were great in the play, Cole.
What?
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
You know that accident up there?
It's our pleasure.
Good for you.
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Nope.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Suzie???
Dammit, Carl!!!!
No shit.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
"And a slash-slash there --"
He means moon shining.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
-- It's not me!
It's time to make amends.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Yeah?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
No --
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
What are you doing?!
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Where's the old half--Mexican?
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
I never danced in a towel before.
When one sees you they all see you.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
He's just exhausted.
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Or in the slammer.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Yeah?
He's history.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
We're gone.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
You okay?
Talk to me.
Breaker. Breaker.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
You're sure?
And threw us into the lake.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
What'd you say?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
About what?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
...I'm sorry...
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
You're finished.
...Does he know?
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
You got clicks, anything?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Wow.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
So how we lookin'?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
What!?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
What's wrong?
Can it work?
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
How much sleep?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Shut up.
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
Human beings can die.
Get out --
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
When did this happen?
I need to see Snow.
What are they?
Rheya...
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
I wasn't.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You go home.
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
Where've you been?
Why did you say those things?
You're the coward.
Do you?
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Thank you.
Neither did I.
You never said you wanted one.
I can't stay here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I wish you wouldn't.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
It's terrific Win.
Uh...
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Let's get a drink.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
You don't like him, do you?
Claire?
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
I do care about you!
I don't know you...
Are you okay?
When can I see you?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
What a memory.
It wouldn't work.
"For"...?
Claire!
Say goodbye, Mike.
Claire...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Tommy...!
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
For how long?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Coming to bed?
What?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
What did you do tonight?
Let me drive...
What about Tommy?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Not Koontz.
Are you in charge here?
You're here 'til what time?
Hold it...!
How do I know that's her?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I was there.
See?
Lizzy!
Harry…
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
I suppose.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.
Sefton!
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Jawohl!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
It's a mouse trap.
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
No, Animal.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Says who?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
You heard that, Sefton?
Are you questioning me?
What did you say?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Are any of them inhabited?
Well?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
This is the Nexus?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Can I?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Close to retirement?
Yes.  Thank you.
Sir?
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Aye, sir.
Tractor beam, aye!
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Could it be Spock's?
David... Sorry I'm late.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Underground deposit?
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Captain, what's happening?!
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
How many more?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
You would have done the same for me.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Would you look at that?
Genesis?! Whatever for?
May I ask why...?
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.

You should take the Vulcan, too.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Bones!...
What must I do?
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
500 Kellicams!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Sir, may I --
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Say thank you.
Shore leave, Admiral.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
They even killed the galley chief.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
So are we, it looks like.
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
But the child --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
I'm trying, David.
Steady on course. All systems normal.
They won't --
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
We'll be going to warp speed --
Try the emergency channels...
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
And who is this?
The word is given: warp speed.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
I would not presume to debate you.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Uh oh.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
How?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Power levels quite low, sir.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
The question is irrelevant.
You do this -- for friendship?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
... My shoes...
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Thanks. Cheers.
What's what?
It's true... what you said...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
You mean this is -- goodbye?
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Spock: Condition report!
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Scotty, how long is this bay?
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
How long, Scotty?
Full power, sir.
The whales...?!
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
... Yes?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Just use the keyboard...
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
You have warp capability?
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
A perfect moment?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Don't you ever get tired?
Chase me!
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
I do not take orders from you.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Fail-safe?
Implants bothering you?
I don't think they believe us.
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
What's inside that nebula cluster?
My name is Sojef, Captain.
You've not aged a day since then?
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
Can you beam him off?
Come in.  Hi.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
Montana.  Energize.
Yes...
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
It's Cochrane.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
Is it Japanese?
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Yes...
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Can you configure it?
I believe so.
I am the Borg.
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Ready to make a little history?
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Yes.
Yes.
Something wrong with that?
What do you want?
Cochrane?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
Were the two of you... involved?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Why?
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Good luck, sir.
Return to our own time?
We have to stop them from sending that message.
They're bypassing Engineering...
Good luck, Captain.
You may need assistance, doctor...
What the Hell's going on?
Thanks...
We're explorers not diplomats!
We were until your torpedoes!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
He's a DOCTOR!
He just tried to save him!
For insubordination.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Shields. Battle stations.
Thank you, Captain.
He's got it.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Just the prototype.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
Captain...
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Captain --
Faith...?
A lie?
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Why?
No. Can I move now?
Indefinitely.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
Now, you make a toast.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
What purpose does this serve?
No.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
Imzadi. This is so good.
This isn't real.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Sir?
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
We're being hailed.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Sir --
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Report.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Yes.
You know I need to verify this.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
Long ago.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
No -- this is wasting time.
How long?
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
They're holding position.
And?
Praetor.
For the moment.
I don't think so... 
How much are your rooms?
What do you do?
Make any money?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Recognize this?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
Is that what's affecting your performance?
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Steering wheel...
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
No gas.
Closed?
Gas.
I am husband?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
In your pocket, please...
Money.
A drink.
I do not understand.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
You want this ticket?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Yes?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Are you my friend?
Yes.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
You liked my singing?
No. Get in.
I feel better if I move.
I can't stay on this planet.
You are cold.
What for?
I know how to gamble now.
The cook again?
The yellow one.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I love you.
I will.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Judy, that's stupid.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
You saw that?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
He has his uses too.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
You should feel like shit.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
Where's Faith?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Your sex life?
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
So that gives you something.
But that doesn't add, does it.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Tell me.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Are we under arrest?
What is that?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Besides that.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
She's buried.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Its called insubordination.
How do you feel, Agent
He got away. I had him. He got away.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
Huh?, sir.
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Not especially.
This is a sexy case.
Don't even go there. What's up?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
You got a point there.
Look at this fellow... or this one.
He thinks he looks young.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
There are Agency regulations about this.
He's called a couple times.
What's up?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
You okay?
I...
How are we going to find him?
Agent Mackelway?
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Lead the way, Murman.
If I owe, I will go.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
I believe it's in my file, sir.
But why attack an Agent?
You're right. I know.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Are you sure? Maybe...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Tell me about it...
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
...then ask where you met her...
Hi.
Let me just check on my boy.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
No...
It's a rebound.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Me too.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...Which one...?
Hi, Mike?
How's it going? It's been a while...
Good.  I think about things.
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
There's the rub.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
What'd you get?
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Him?
What's dumb about it?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
I didn't make it...
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Don't call me ever again.
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know...
When?
Tonight, baby.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Wake up, baby.
Did she, or did she not smile?
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
You think they're watching?
I know, but...
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
I gotta use the phone.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
What time's this party tonight?
It's on.
Which one?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
How long do I wait to call?
Tomorrow?
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
...shivering...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
You're money.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
It is on.
Sorry man.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
This morning.
Yes.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
One of Tattaglia's people?
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Will you give this to him.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Mike, why am I out?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
Yes.  Tell me.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
When will I see you again?
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Don't ask me.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Do you renounce Satan.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
You're unlucky.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Uncanny!
I'll come down.
It's just an undercoat. 
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
What?
I'm never going back!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Good afternoon!
Your parents met her.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
You're breaking my ribs!
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Is Freddie here?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
Why?
So tell me.
Really? To Italy?
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Sure.
Who is it?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Mr Greenleaf.
I think it might hurt her to know.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Frances?
So I'm learning.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Very.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
What's funny?
What's your secret?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
What?
Let's go.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
What rumour?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
No.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
How was it?
Was that Meredith?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Peter, I... I...
November 7th is my information.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Huh?
Who mam?
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
That's really something.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
I mean porno movies.
What about the record?
Yeah.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Oh, Tom, please.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Have you been noticing anything strange?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
This is gotta be a game, right?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Is he Italian?
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
What's your real name?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
Who's a killer?
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
What should I do? Call the cops?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Yes.
Physical? Criminal?
Who?
You would, huh?
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Not really.
He's got a gun, sir.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
I'm a field agent.
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Did you bring along something to read?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
... including me.  Right?  
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
What was that?
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes... yes, I do.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
No, sir.
I'm not refuting anything.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mother o'god...
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
What's that?
Good to meet you.  Again.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Well...
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
She's very pretty.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
I... I don't believe this.
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Sit.  Play with me.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
What exactly did you hear?
You hungry, son?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Yes?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Yes?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Thank you.
A trifle.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
No!
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Darling, of course I do!
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Morning.
Do you know him?
Right across the bay there.
Yes?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Daniels.
Yep?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Thank you.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
How long have you known her?
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
When?
Where will we go?
I can handle it.
You're doing fine.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Where's Mitch?
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Yes.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Oh.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
How?
We met in court.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Yes.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
So you didn't go to school together.
Why?
I do different things on different days.
What?
So they united.
It's so damn quiet out there.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie...
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
How long have they been gathering there?
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
And he'll talk?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
There we are!
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
I've heard of it.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
He was a nice horse.
Toddy hates me.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
Get out of here!
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You've been with Gray again.
I hate that picture.
Fucking Zombie.
The scar.
I was a friend of your sister's.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
Honey. I just can't.
What is it?
You're in with them.
You killed her!
Please. Come inside.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
That was my first question.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
I thought that was only for bombs.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
No -- I'm afraid not.
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Why not, Bobby?
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
It was a wonderful day.
You still haven't answered my question.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Just twelve.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
I was.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
No. That's all finished.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Can't stand light?
Well... we blew Plan A.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
I can't beat a Triumph.
What?...
Where's Star, David?!
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
What's that smell!?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
I told Max eight o'clock.
... And stay outta here.
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
Did we have a date tonight?
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
It was a dream, Star.
He looks dead.
I'll hitch.
See you later.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
We're getting close...
Ocean air!
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
No, I'm not...
-- a job.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
I am?
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Well, I...
Hi...
What do you mean?
Ouch.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Let's go see them.
When?
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Did you spill something?
What happened, Michael!?
Star.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Where these tracks headed?
Yeah.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
What you doin'?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Now hold him.
Nothing we can do about that.
A couple of hours.
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
When was the last time you used it?
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Looks good.
Four!
You jerking off or just pissed?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Yeah!
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
What do you do on the towers?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
What kind of stories?
Yes.  Just about here.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
When was his mother taken?
It frightens you.
What's it all for?
Vox --
What's your name?
As slaves.
How do you control the Morlocks?
What?
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
So you take their best...
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Dance with me...
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Well there's something new.
You're late.
Darling.
I need... to talk to you.
Let's walk through the park...
Alex...?!
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
You're not from beyond the valley.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
How long ago?
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
All of you?
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
I can see Kalen's point.
How do you decide?
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Kalen...
It was different then.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
How did you get hurt?
I'm fine.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
Yes.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I need to get this letter to someone.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
I think I can remember what's on them.
[Beat] What?
Yeah.
[Beat] You bled to death.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
How you doin'?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
I don't understand.
I could try to...make it stop.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
What do you mean?
Well, what time is it?
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
What are you talking about?
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Beat] How do you know?
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
It's gonna be sticky.
So what am I supposed to do?
Can you drive?
I'm not sure.
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
I'm sorry.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
In the leg.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
No!
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
What did ya do?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Tell me.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Where'd y'all go?
What the fuck is going on?
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Exactly.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Why are you actin' like this?
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
What did Darryl say?
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
What happened to your hair?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Taking a shower.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Thelma.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Now what what?
Yeah.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
What?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
We can live in a hacienda.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Now what?
Then let's not get caught.
Go.
We been seein' you all along the way.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
You sent that?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Why not?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Well then you've got to call her, man.
I don't know what to say.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Don't you want to know my name?
Are you... an architect?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
No, I mean
I know he's around here someplace.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
That must make it tough.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Good lookin'?
What's a mook?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Where's Puffy?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Ted, are you okay?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hey.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
But but what about Steve?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
What?! No please, sir --
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Oh, still sore about this.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
And?
Smoke.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
That is correct.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Max.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
You're sure...
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Bob?
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Hey. Nice tie.
What's this about?
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
What journey?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Meet me at base. Over.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
What did he say?
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
Ray --
What'd you expect to hear?
What you call myths, we call our history.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Cuz you're a cop.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What's that?
1868...
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
What ya want?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
The what?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
There you go with those moves again.
Lieutenant...
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Uh hum.
What if he's not?
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
It's just as I thought.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
I'm still second best.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
You don't have to do this.
I sit. I think. I play games.
Want to play the game?
What truth?
Now?
I hope you find him.
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Remember one thing.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
I know!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Great move. Great
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Time to go.
I was a victim of circumstance.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
GET LOST!
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
No bother.
I called your house.
My wife's house.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Do you expect me to believe you?
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
Kill him.
Hetero.
Sleazy...and demure.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Where's Kuato?
You're Kuato, right?
Why not?
Let me buy you a drink.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Quit while you're ahead.
Yeah, sweetheart?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
What are you doing?
Oh God, Doug.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
That a problem?
All right.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
You know, up the jeep trail.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
You're full of shit.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Like hell you are.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Use the fucking bomb!
Come on.  Get away from it!
Yeah, geography.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Ms. Vin's sister.
Objection.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Chinatown street gang.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
What other case?
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
...For ten years, now.
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- Find him?
My mother find you?
Racist asshole came at me.
What went down?
Y-yes, sir.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
Five years.
And its purpose?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
I'm nearly out.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Was there an argument?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
What is it, Gordon?
Phillip?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Teresa Banks.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
I don't know, Sam.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
I don't know what to do.
Oh god, Laura.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Where are you going?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
No, you should forget about last night.
You're not mad at me?
What can I tell you?
How did the car get back here?
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Did you make me a tape?
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
We're on our way, Baby.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
It does matter. We're in love.
What's going on?
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
You mean the ones you pity.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Hiking?
Fish eyes?
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
...school's fine...
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
I'm fine.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
What is the truth?
You know what that would mean?
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
...of Anesthesiology?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Ed Concannon.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Mr. Concannon...?
Anything special about the case?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
...that's all right.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Why is that?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
'Code Blue'...
Yes.
Thank you...
Yessir. I'm sorry.
What?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
What happened...?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
What is that to you...?
Joe...  Joe...
Yes. Price...
Kathy Price.
Who are you protecting, then?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's locked.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...fifty thousand dollars?
Yeah.
Hi, Mickey...
Come on. Let's get a drink.
...I'm going to need your help...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
Right.
Yes.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Don't you live at home?
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Must be somebody in there.
Yes, but...
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
What's up?
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Tomorrow night.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Home.
When do you think it'll be done?
You're not crazy, by the way.
Seemed, not was.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
I know how Chase really died.
No, not really.  I...
Now?
Black's fine.
You may not like what you hear.
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Fifteen.
There's still a way.
Fine.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
Believe what?
Congratulations.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
I couldn't have done it without you.
Figured what out?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
That's not why he's sending me.
Can we talk?
Do you have your ticket?
Fine.
It was so real...
Jesus, you never told them?
Yes, sir.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
Sir...?
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
Immortality.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
That's enough.
Why'd you jump?
How would you know?
They tell you that?
That's not a satisfactory answer.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
It's outta here!
Joy, rapture...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
They are much more than that, sir.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Need a hand?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Sorry to hear it.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Gas?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
You hitched yet?
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
But I'm wild at heart.
...Asshole.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
What?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
Yeah.
Under a hundred.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Sail?
I mean tomorrow.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
Got any plans?
Just tell me what you want.
That's your business... I don't care how.
In the head.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
Yes.
You got nice tits.
No.
Whattya mean?
So?
I didn't see nothin'...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
I just mean...
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Tripp.
What's this guy's problem?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Shut up, James.
How are you -- is it Joe?
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
I've been trying to finish a book...
I know.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
Is that really it?
That's really it.
They're glass. The buttons.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Washed up?
Isn't this...?
Maybe...
When we fall, we fall hard.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
When?
I think so... What about you?
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
I'm kidding. Hello?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Oh?
Listen, Antonia --
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
As a heart attack.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Where's Emily, Hank?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Where you stand?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
That's weird.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Hey, is that a school?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Is it because of Anna?
The birthday party.
What's that?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
What do you mean?
What are you looking at?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
Their sound is quite musical.
I can't.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Were you watching me?
What's up?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'm adjusting okay.
It gives me headaches.
I'd keep away from him.
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
No.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
No way.
Bad idea.
Honest? No.
Have to talk about something.
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
I couldn't say.
They usually tell me.
What did you think would happen?
Is this the first one?
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Why?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
We're little kids.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Nothing.
How do you feel about that?
Are you okay?
I'm all right.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What's weird about that?
Neither do you.
What about them?
You're still here.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
What's the problem?
Look, you can go now.
It's not what you think.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
What?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Being here, with me.
I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.
Are you serious?
Not ever?
Guess that makes you pretty special.
I say we call it quits.
What's going on?
You okay?
Yeah.
She-hit.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
I haven't worn mine in months.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Need some help?
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Well, that's that.
We've only got one suit.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
'Fish'?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
4800 feet.  It's official.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
Which one shall I wear?
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
At what?
Well, what?
Somebody must live here!
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Don't be so humble.
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Are you feeling better?
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Why are you looking at me like that?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
What do you mean by sensible?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Looks like the weather is changing.
Why don't you try?
Don't you ever paint men?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Whose boat is that?
You know, I don't love anybody.
Zuria?
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
Why?
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
It's not my time of month.
No I don't.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
He's told you?
Often?
And you like that?
Where do you meet?
Where?
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Not my fault.
She's dead isn't she?
She can.
How?
And that you're stupid?
Her headaches.
Alright.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Why?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
We went to chapel for vespers.
What do you think it's there for?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Frightened.
I hate him...
Yes.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Marty, what are you doing here?
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
You have proof?
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Yes.
Do you still go to church?
I can beat that.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
That's ridiculous...
So, someone else could have done it.
I've already told you what I thought.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
Not simple, no.
What?
Was the child full term?
Your niece!
Like keeping her home from school?
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Nothing...
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Saint Peter?
Listen to her singing.
Begin what?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
She's been touched by God, yes.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
This is permission to take her apart.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
The baby?
You wanted that child out of the way.
Eh?
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Are you now?
Shurrup!
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
I beg your pardon?
That's not your Grandfather.
A butcher?
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Sure. .
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Should I say it?
I don't think that bit's right.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Are you pulling my leg?
I see.  Do you like the play?
Oh aye, a sledge.
They ought to be.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
And what do you do about it?
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Where are you off to?
Eh?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Hello, Grandfather!
Yeah ... so what?
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
What are you doing there?
Hiding.
What little old man?
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Hello.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
I've got the stuff. Come here.
He belongs to Paul.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Eh, what's all this?
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Then take her down.
What's wrong?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
Computer, what language was that?
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Yes!
Hard to say.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
What?
It's clear.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
What do you mean?
Still unconscious?
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
What do you mean, no?
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Don't count on it.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
Yeah?
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
But?
This ship is full of cat hair.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Now what?
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
I'll get you out of there.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Minh...
Seal everything now!
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Shit.  When?
Deal.
What?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Okay, we're in business.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
How's it going?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Hello, there. Who are you?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Just like that, eh?
It wasn't meant to be.
Paved with what, then?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
I'm in love with Lloyd!
You have no right to say such things!
... and Karen.
You sat and talked until it was light...
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
That's not true!
Then say so.
Yes, Addison.
Yes, Addison.
We never met. That's why.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Of course I knew.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Bill...
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Thank you so much.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
I love you...
Cut it out.
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
It's all over.
Addison-!
Don't calm down.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Don't be condescending.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
Never try to outguess Margo.
Groom.
So few come back...
Also Addison deWitt.
Ah...
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
Don't run away, Bill.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
Lemme fix you a drink.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
The same size?
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Miss Harrington...
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
How long does it take?
Oh, no...
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
The show must go on.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
They certainly don't waste much time.
I don't intend to be.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Eve... don't cry.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
- an understudy's performance.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Right here.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Hello, Miss Channing.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
They're your fans, your audience-
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
With tears.
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Eve.
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
You know, she probably means well, after all...
I don't think I could be.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Well...
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
Anything you've got.
Republican?
When?
Goddamnit--
How high up, which Republicans?
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
Who?
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
I didn't do anything wrong.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--so?
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
One minute but then--
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
No games, Irwin; give.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Who by?
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
--I'm not your source on that--
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
--what do you think?--
We can't talk inside either?
--I'm not here.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
They are not my clients.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Ratfucking.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
Where?
Where in government?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
Are you sure?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
So?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
What else have you got?
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
Haldeman.  Right?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
All right, I got some scotch.
Why is this?
Me too.  For the most part.
What?!
Stifler told me.
That's nice.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
That's not why we're going out.
You got it, stud.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Pontificated.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Dad!  I know!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Kevin, this is serious!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Victoria...I love you.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
I'm such a loser.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
That junior chick?
Keep it down, dude.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Also like sex with my wife.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Andy! Holy shit!
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Don't you want to change?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
We don't both have to die.
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Shit. I feel sick.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Now!
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Did I tell you that?
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
By pulling my hair?!
It's the best fork of all
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
You'd lose your security deposit?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
You're a princess...
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
What do you mean?
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
Come on.
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
Can I have your autograph?
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
You're like New York. You're an island.
Why not?
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Oh, right.
Nice car.
Don't be funny.
M'hm...
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah.
Okay.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Hey?
M'hm.
M'hm.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Really?
Let's just do it, all right?
Are yuh?
Yeah.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
I didn't follow you!
It's his name.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
What's- It's me, open up.
Oooh.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Yeah.
Yeah, where is the spider?
Okay, let me have this.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, I had the radio on.
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Oh-
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
You catch Dylan?
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Yes.
Whatta you mean?
May I see your license, please?
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Forget it, Max.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
She was going through my pocketbook!
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Oh.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
...of possibly working together.
Yeah.
It's the way they do things.
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
No, what?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Not this time.
What what's about?
Oh.
Oh.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Don't you miss it?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
And?
She left a note.
We live next door.
There's a test, you know.
Not as a rule.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Yes.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
She left the fucking gate open.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
It's a Calder.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes I did.
You lose this?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Sally did all this herself?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
No you're not.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Easy tiger.
I've never done this before.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Yes.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
I like you.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I'm so sorry.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
How's he doing?
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
You're not serious.
I'm sorry.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Oh?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
I wasn't finished.
I never like to talk about my work.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
Like Joe.
A notch above the storage room.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
Oh Soph...
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
You dance...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Yes, what else?
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Good night.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
You shouldn't.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
You all right? What's the matter?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Here.
I don't understand --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
No -- I don't want anything.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Who?
I mean -- her apartment.
They had to pump it out.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
No doubt about it.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
I don't want to talk to him.
Are you supposed to?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
I guess so.
I'm fine all over.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Who?
Where is your apartment?
I'm not through with you yet.
How would you like to go tonight?
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
To me?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
I dig.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Hi, Baxter.
What do you want?
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
She going to be all right, Doc?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
Well, I have things to do --
Family?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Can I ask you a personal question?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Kubelik.
A.W.O.L.?
That guy really must've belted him.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
What for?
You fool -- you damn fool.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
I never said goodbye, Fran.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Remember what we talked about?
I wasn't trying.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
All set for what?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Yeah --
Esprit de corps --
Two whole drums --
Moonby what?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Which part is that ?
No.
North ?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
What'd he say?
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Well, get in there.
What the hell is it?
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Ours.
Who is he?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
Do you know that jungle?
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
What do you mean?
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
You've gone crazy.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's the pain?
What Truth?
How did we get here?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
You knew him best.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
What's this tiger shit?
You think?
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
Why?
So Kurtz is alive.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Well , who's in command here?
215  CONTINUED:
184  CONTINUED:
39   CONTINUED:
Six months.
My dad was a Navy doctor.
What are you doing?
That's not what I meant.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
I'm here to do my job.
Too bad we're heading west.
Have to get these wet things off.
Stay still.
I already have.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Shut up!
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
Thought that door was open last night...
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
It's Sam Wilder!
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Don't be silly. How bad?
No.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
How old are you?
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Carol the waitress?
Okay.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
Stop asking everyone.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
This one has a special meaning.
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
Hello.
How you doing?
Boyfriend?
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Yes. I really would.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
One night with me!
Help!
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Good evening.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Terrify me?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Not it at all, really.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
I'm on the scent.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
How did he know?
Hello, Robert.
What?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Right.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Just Electra?
How did you get into the business?
More or less.
Why not?
You went from high school to the Agency?
But you knew what they were training you for?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Because I want to know.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Where did you learn it?
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
We split the money?
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
I think I got one today.
How do you know they're not?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
It happened to you before?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Why are you working today?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Taken.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Some.
Anything.
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
So how's your work?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
How to make a buck!
Because it's in English?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
What's that? Free!
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Have you ever stolen anything?
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
So why didn't we?
Afternoon!
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Tell me some bad news?
So?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
You don't understand, I can't!
Good morning.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
I don't want to get in trouble.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Hi, want to take up dancing?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What for?
Why are you doing all this, what for?
What's the Bugler?
What would you like, beer?
Run into Josh?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
And you broke into that room?
A kind of freedom.
And the students?
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
You are responsible...What has happened?
It could help with a new car --
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
He wants to show now.
Late night.  You?
I could take after Dad, too.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Get yourself a glass.
I know you don't want help.
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
I know. Don't say anything.
Looking for intelligent life?
You're not in a very good mood.
Oh. Just not at school...
Yeah --
Hey.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
Excuse me?
You're worried about your college applications.
I should have told you sooner --
What are you thinking?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
Up to?
Does it have to do with Jamie?
This week.
Like what, sir?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
This... is the number one single?
I beg your pardon?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
You remember me...?
Eileen, Chinese food again?
How are you?
Dad, you seen the drill?
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Huh?
I'm going to be at the dance.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
A gold mine?
So what? We'd be rich!
Professor? Professor Brown?
Pardon me?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
How did you know?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Well, it was there.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
What theater was I at?
Suzy!
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Jack.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
You still in school?
Hi.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Yeah.
You know what I think?
Are you sure?
You said that once already... Too late now.
Look at all this junk.
I don't know.
Yes.
I just don't want to go.
This your place?
Just thinking.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Maybe.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Arachtoid.
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
So where's Buckaroo?
Let him go.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
You wrote his scripts for him?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
No... Can I come in?
Hold on –
What do you think happened?
Yeah, but Charlie –
You'll be back?
I'm at the Earle.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Physician, heal thyself.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How about the coke?
What was she like?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
Who?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Was there anyone with you last night?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
How did you feel when he died?
But you didn't hurt --
Fine.
How's your new book?
Did you think it was so special?
What did you think?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
What happens to them?
Yes I am.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Nilsen?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I went over last night, too.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
Where the hell you goin'?
Homicide.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Did you check all four years?
Naa..
Saddle River, New York!
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Who did this?  Who did this?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
A primate?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Yup.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
I don't really have any problems.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Me? Why?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
So what?
A what?
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
Hanging on every word.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Ten, nine...
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
What seems to be the problem?
I'm afraid to ask.
You're loosing your cool
Mr. Freeze.
I was just hanging around.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
What happened to his wife?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Impressive
You will rescue my wife
Where is my wife?
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Actually, he took the car.
How are you feeling, young man?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
...A bat.
All the answers are numbers.
Mystery.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
What's wrong?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Wait. You can't go.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Just ones this beautiful.
Excuse me.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
Fast work. You just moved here.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Chase?
Who is it?
How could I forget?
...or death.
A man with a death wish.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
B-12.
How high up would you say that is?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
What about the girl?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
As far as I know.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
All street mimes should be executed.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
I missed you, Lieutenant.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
How'd you know it was me?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
You are on drugs.
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Ali?  What's wrong?
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Two dollars please.
Big day today, huh? 78
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Howls he getting on with the family?
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Shut up, Kevin.
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Butt-snatch...
Beavis.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Does that say Xanax?
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Talk ta me, Bork.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
That's better. Yes?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
No, Jane.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
They make gypsies look good.
<u>You</u> left me.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
What?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
Did you get the paint?
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
Our cemetery?
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
No, Lydia, we're dead.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Are you a spirit too?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
... I will.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Stepmother.
The attic room is locked --
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
In a day or two, yes.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Yes, sir.
Would you care to take it, sir?
There's no need for a hospital.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I would like to watch television.
May I ask your name?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Yes.
Yes.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
To watch...? To watch me...?
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Yes, I understand.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
I feel very good in here.
I agree.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I understand.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes. I like to watch.
Some pictures...?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
I agree.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
Yes.
Yes. That is surprising.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
But you won't sign, correct?
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
... Would you take me on a tour?
It's that gardener!
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
This is not what I requested.
No, sir.
Right, Chief.
... So what does all that add up to?
... Well?
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Thank you.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The monkey.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
How was it?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
I'm sorry for everything.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Mr. Juarez?
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
No. I understand perfectly.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
I'm right?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
What'll you have?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
You wanted to be partners with me?
I've fallen in love.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Hello. Wendy.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Can I be anyone I want?
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Thank you, Floris.
Do you dream often?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
How do we do that?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
What's the play?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
I'm getting better all the time.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Good-bye, Maxine.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
Then what do I do?
I likes yellow.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
You still know.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Yes?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Yes sir
Oh.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
Back stiff?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Morning.
Mama let me help you.
True.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
You?
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Never found out.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
I don't want to know.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
She was only-
Who is she? Where she come from?
You shaved.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
The?  Who the fff--
What tied the room together, Dude?
What--
What's a pederast, Walter?
Kill that poor woman.
Uh-huh.
He's handicapped, huh?
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
...Also, my rug was stolen.
No.  Here.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Excuse me?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Delayed after-eff--
Jeffrey.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
No, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
The what?
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
What the fuck is going on there?
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Walter--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Who the fuck is that?
Yeah.
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
What's your point, Dude?
Huh?
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
This driveway.
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
He can't walk, Walter!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Yeah.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Fuckin' A.
WHAT?!
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
I'm not--
Two years.
You're hurt.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
You don't have to hunt to do it.
What do you want me to do?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
So?
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
What's going on?
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Not that I'm in contact with.
Tell me something, Skid --
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Whistler!
I don't buy it.
You're not going anywhere.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
Hold out your hands.
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
Deacon brought me back.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
How?
Domini?
What're you doing there?
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Oak?
So says her website.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
You said the name "James."
Nothing. I dunno--
Whatever you want.
Absolutely.
--hours before--
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
What about night?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--I saw what I saw.
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--turn the camera off--
This isn't about us.
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Spite.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
Let's get inside.
What is all this shit?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Jesus.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Shoot.
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
Why?
Does she, goddamnit??
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Yes.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
Meurice--
What?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
Thanks.
We don't seem to be communicating--
Uh-huh.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Ya catch any fish?
Right. Sorry.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What day is it today, Angie?
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Are you Detective Williams?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Is Sandy part of this?
Look at these. What are these?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Yes? What is it?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright. 
Yes.
See my nipples?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No. I should go.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Do you like my body?
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
I did. are you?
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
No thanks.
Go where?
Heineken.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
You really want to do this, don't you?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay. thanks.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
That's what I thought.
Okay. okay.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I can't dance fast.
Are you feeling okay?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
What time are visiting hours?
Well.
He comes over to study.
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Where do you guys want to count?
Five-thousand per kilo.
Que va hacer?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Excuse me?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
What the fuck is that?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
I don't want to talk about it.
Not really, no.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Because they caught me?
But you must.  It's the only way.
Where do I put this!?
Are you comfortable with this?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
Derek Foreal.
Today.
It would be my pleasure.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
And Diego?
Diego?
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
How are you doing, George?
I don't think so.
I don't know.  My name is George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Jesus Christ.
Pablo said no?
No, that's alright.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
You swear?
It's alright, Dad.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
For instance, something like this?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Nice weed, huh?
No shit, Kevin?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
Second district ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
With an unloaded pistol?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
To show them to the UN, right?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Did they argue the day before he died?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Can you?
I've got work to do.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
No -- but I can get it for you.
She was here?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Intense.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
What happened after that?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Did you suggest any?
-- And what did you suggest?
That's enough.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
October twenty-seventh.
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
Where did you meet him?
We dated for about a month last year.
Did he make your life miserable?
Yes -- he did.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
Who told you that?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
You know I can't talk about that.
Yes.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Sorry.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
Can I see you later?
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- take these off.
What are you going you doing?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
No, Your Honor.
But Your Honor--
The witness will answer the question.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
If you want me to.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Is that alright, Frank?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Please -- not now.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
That's too bad.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
It had to get there somehow.
It's not that long.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to read them.
Bar across the street.
Nobody did.
Carolyn!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Oh, yes.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
That's it.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Where are you staying while you're here?
I doubt that.
Why?
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Help cook?
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
And did you?
You drink bug repellent?
What?
Francesca?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
You really don't need anyone?
No.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
My mistake. I apologize.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Wonderful. Uh...
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
You want to eat something?
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Near the church.
Trouble. Why?
I had a temper.
I can't do this, honey.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
What about your husband?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I'm positive.
Franny?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
'S up?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Shit.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Why?
What else does she say?
Bill!  Bill?!
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Please...help me...
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
What building?
Shit, that was fast.
Not that I remember.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
You shouldn't have hit me.
Know what?
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar!
I didn't expect --
She's doing the work herself.
No!  They're still on their way.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
The hell I can't!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Not on duty, sorry.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Okay, sure, Mick.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Me?  Why?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Maybe.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
How long have you been with him?
I don't understand - ?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
How much money?
Yes.
Yeah.
What time did you say they would be there?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
An accident.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
I'm still here.
Hey.
Hey.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
What do you mean?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
So it's time to go home.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Look, maybe I should just...
-- sir? --
You are a friend of his?
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Did you?
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
People do amazing things when they're scared.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
You got me pretty fucking curious.
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
And that's it?
My husband's out looking for him.
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- he accessed the account --
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
... And then some.
You telephone, sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
... new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Go away.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
If I can help you ...
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Jack!!
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Christ! You do know it all!
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
And you're mine.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Where do I get it stamped?
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
No, really.
Well, all wars do -
Cut it out, Sam.
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Leave me alone!
I'm going to open it!
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Don't worry.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Tuttle?
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Try next of kin.
That's it.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
Damn! Blast!
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
You want to take my console into your office?
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Hello ... hello ...
But I could be anybody.
Sign here please.
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
What's his name?
You're not going to die.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
You never know.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Yes?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
Fifteen minutes.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
No.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Whatja doing?
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Do it!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
What?
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Stomach again.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Keep it to yourself.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
Hold it down, okay?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Which would you prefer?
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
As good as humanly possible.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
What?
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
This isn't friendship.
Speaking.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
So who's the guy?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
But thanks.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
We could...
No stop where he's all besieged.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Is everything all right?
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Why so glum?
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
It's not opinion.
Hi.
I like "godsend."
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Whoa, this was a mistake.
They said it would be okay if...
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
How's it going?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I didn't think you'd make it.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
It's incredible who's here.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
Hi.  It's me.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
How can you say that to me?
Why?
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Are you nervous, Walter?
A girl with a body like mine?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
What's it called?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Yes Walter.
I know what it is to be ignored.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Are you ready?
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Nice night out...
Murdered...man?...
Are you alright?
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I know, man.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
Man look at that get up !
You...made that?
Yeah.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
A show..how soon can we go?
Yeah, why?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Huh?!!!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
I- don't know what you're talking about!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Well I'm overjoyed.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Good night Walter...
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Man has a complex.
Would you sleep with them?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Dying.
Hi, Buffy.
Maybe.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I do?  I guess I do.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
Didn't you get my message?
I didn't expect to see you.
I'm going to the dance.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Pretty shallow of you.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Why do you keep saying that?
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
We'll cover it later.
Here?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
It was necessary.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Buffy...
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
All right.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
That's the plan.
The mark of the Coven.
Hi, Grueller.
Could be.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Omniplex?
What happened?
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Wit-tay.
Oh, yeah!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Smell of booze much.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
How ya like that?
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Death is like spring training?
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
I know what it is.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
You don't have to...
I'm Crash Davis.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
I want to be had.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I got released.
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
If you believe in Voodoo.
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
You're a cocksucker!
He did know.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
I was playing naked.
I was great, eh?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Why am I a fuck?
No.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
Pussy.
I ain't hitting a man first.
I'd kill ya.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
You were never my guest?!
That's right.
You were wandering around.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
...been right, but who knows?
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Yeah.
Stop -
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
All right, Ace?
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
...very difficult to get in.
No, I don't wanna come -
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
I lost control?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Okay?
No, a...
What people?
What are you -
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Hello.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
This woman's an institution.
I-I'll do it.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
Yeah.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Hi. Nice to see you.
No, he didn't.
Huh?
Okay, okay.
No, you don't.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Yeah.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
I was with somebody.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
Oh, sh-
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I want you to let me go.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
This is not the way to treat people.
...worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I just wanna get out of here.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Mm.
Yeah?
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
I understand.
Go get a bag, man.
Pitch-black?! It -
Hey!
Now move along.
Here we go!
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
It's in all the papers.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Of course, Remo.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
I'll be right out.
Mm.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
All right.
Tell me.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
He gives a fuck what I do?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
I'll be there.
Yeah?
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
Yes, you did.
No, he's not.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
It's what you want?
Get the fuck out of here.
Yes!
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Come on.
What's the matter?
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
You do?
We'll go later.
Right.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
He's sittin' by the phone -
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
Listen...
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Why?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Well, how come I laid nine?
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Get up.
Come here, come here.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
What's takin' so long over there?
She asleep?
They're havin' a good time too.
You must have drunk too much.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Hey.
How you doin'?
Since when do you talk like that?
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Yes, uh...
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
In women?
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Selina, are you okay?
We're waiting.
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Even the skylight?
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
Spooky.
For when the time comes..
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
How much?
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Like you don't know...
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
But I'm blind.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Don't you have children?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Lady, don't let him do it!
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You don't understand.
Will you let me explain!
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
What do they need her for?
Hey drop it, okay?
And that was the end of it?
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
What bank?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
It's locked.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
You timed that beautifully.
I thought it was inspired.
Who's in back?
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Do you have to point that?
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You could've hit me.
Did you hear that?
What's happening?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
What's your point?
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
You won't live to see it.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Who are you working for?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
Stay there.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Don't worry.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Who are you?
Government business?
I thought so.
So let's call this the usual.
Yeah?
Who the fuck is he?
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
Piss off, Dave!
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Tell me about him.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
You mean that?
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Do they know?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Don't.
You do something for me, Dil?
Afraid so.
Come on...
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
Died...
Got to be somewhere.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
Love you, Dil.
And you'll never leave me?
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Yes. Now.
I promise.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
He's all right.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
I heard.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
What do you mean?
And what happens then?
Peter.
I'm sure.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Thank God for that.
How is it a farce?
Thank you, handsome.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Could you?
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
She's a friend of mine
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Like what?
Depends on what you believe in.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
What?
Don't think that way.
Go to sleep now.
What?
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
What if I did?
You didn't?
I never know nothing.
It was fun while it lasted.
That fucker's dead --
All right -- where's the letter?
Oh, come on!
I could eat a horse.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
Adam --
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Reggie -- please believe me!
You lied to me so many times --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
You mean spies and things like that?
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Thanks very much.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Describe him.
Café.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Bartholomew?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
No.
Back where?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Reggie?
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Sure.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Tuesday.
Why?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
No sense messing up the streets.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
I don't believe it.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Forty-five thousand.
And the last one?
What do you mean, no?
But his mother --
Yes.
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Voilà what?
Why, do you think we're going to?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
I don't think I follow you.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
Go on.
So they think he left it with you.
Who is it?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
How do you know what they're doing?
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Stop that!
What is it about?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
I think it's funny.
Not my imports.
Hi Jody.
So?
is there anything you do?
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
Daddy you scared me!
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
I want you to head right home after school.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
No I wasn't.
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
What happened?
This will relax her.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
You know where I can find her?
I am.
Of course I'm scared.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Mark invited me to the party.
No.
Why?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Jody. Wait.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
That's what he said.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
Attacked how?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
The word is Mob.
Who?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Yes?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
You ok?
Just thinking about something.
I got to go.
You can have both if you want.
No.
You can't bring it.
I said no.
Maybe it won't stay in.
help me get in the truck. 
 Oh, shit.

Shit!
Where do you want this stuff?
The guy's a fuckin' moron.

Well, he told me to collect cash.
...moron.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
For cryin' out loud.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
You want cash?
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...

You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog was mean before I met him.
Come on, get in the truck.
What the hell's goin' on?
You stole this truck!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
...the ice cream for money!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
That's...
 

I was thankin' you, asshole!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
Well, then, that means it's call...
...up!
Come on, old...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Come on!
God, man!
...Pete!  Come on.
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!

 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 

Okay.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
...yeah.

Come on!

...or nephew or some good old boy...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...truck.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...miles.
That is loud!  I'm 
I think you oughta cut a...

Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
 All right.  Okay.
...-natic.
What?
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Go!
What the--?
 What's it say? 
...-ta get outta here!
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.

You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.

Who put the big hurt on...
Patriotism is its own reward.
Yeah.
That was quick.
What'd he say?
Vaughn.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.

...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Doc-...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
"I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."

No, go--
Grateful?
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
Do you know what'll...
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...

You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Hit him.

There.
What about these two?
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-fall.
Not tonight...
Hello.
...and unharmed, de-...


...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
...somehow. 
Video lock.
Hit it...
...now!
What's going on, colonel?
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
...colonel?
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
A man named Tim Ma-...
...-son.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Tie a fly...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...back...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
...-son.
Mason.  Mason!
Do you recognize this young man?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...beer.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
'Course you do, Jake.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Honest?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
She's fine.
What does this mean?
Oh, my, yes.
What are you talking about?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Sure thing.
In the garage.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
Then what'll you do?
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
No.
Didn't you call?
What pictures?
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Where?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Do you know where she might be?
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
How did it happen?
Another satisfied client?
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Never forgave him for what?
That dam is a con job.
What dam?
The Valley?
I gave everybody the night off.
It was in Chinatown.
As little as possible.
Just... I have to.
I saw him.
You didn't tell me.
You bastard.
The police?
What does it look like?
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
No...
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
Where can we go?
Oh no.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
There's just one question.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
And Mulwray isn't?
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
I said, the northwest valley.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
He was expecting you?
Yes. No.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
They were partners.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
She ran away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
You don't say?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Then why don't you change jobs? 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Father, I have sinned...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Let's hope they like it there.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
He made an awful lot of money.
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Sixty-two thousand -
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
Has he said when he'll finish?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Almost two to one -
Emily!
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
A chicken?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
How old did you say you were?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Would you sing for me?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
First of all - 
Why, Brad?
All right.
Brad, you are drunk.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
That must have been love.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Thompson!
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
You're kidding.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
What?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
But can we date?
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
He's your fiancé.
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
You only brought one ball?!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
She called me.
Seven months.
She called me Brad.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
It would stand to reason, yes.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Let's hear it.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
You know what pisses me off the most?
We're not playing in the street.
Exactly. They drank it all.
Jesus.
You know.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I want to rent a movie.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
Jesus!
What?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Get to work.
I don't; you did.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Leave her out of this.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
How do you figure?
Like ten after.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
You know him?
How do you know that?
One seventy-nine.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
What's that mean?
He died in the bathroom.
We were going to start again, I think.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Jesus... go ahead.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
You!
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Why do you say that?
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
HOW MANY?
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
I feel sick.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
What did he say?
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
What's this?
What are you talking about?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
No way!
Is he staying here?
He really wants to play metal?
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
You're gonna be at John K's party?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Glad you could drop in.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I love you, too.
What the hell are you doing here?!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Two...
Four...five...
Nice and easy...
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Hello, Gabriel.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I don't think you do.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Maybe lead to a flare up...
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
It was great.
Yeah?
Gabe!
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Never could save a thing.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Tucker and Walker.
Then where the fuck is!
You're looking at him.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
So this is the young man?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Well - I'm back.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
Let me get up.
Yes, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Religion?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Sixth is faster.
The ride is free.
Bottega.
Most of the time.
Max, the cab driver!
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Quite an achievement...
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
It's home.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Two...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
It's a mess.
Yes.
I don't know any Rwandans.
Please.  Don't do anything.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
I never learned jazz.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Let's go.
No.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
Don't start.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
In case he asks.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Answer the question.
Slow the hell down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Geronimo?
I never told her.
Look, I'm sorry --
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
What was your horse's name?
What's the charge?
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
You saved my life.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Surprise me.
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Can you prove any of this?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Shoot.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Is this your dad?
How'd he die?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Murdered?
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
A water main broke.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
We're going to Queens?
What about them?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Where were you the day he died?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Did you kill my father?!
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Geronimo is down.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
That's great.  Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
What's that?
I'm not sure what you mean.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
<u>Why you</u>?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
I want to believe you, too.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
David --
With me.
You mean --
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Am I one... or many?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Ellie -- are you okay?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
I flinched.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Yes.  Very much.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
You're trembling.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Meaning...
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
What went wrong?
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Go hard!
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
We saw the broads.
You can't do that!
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Somebody say somethin'?
Well, whatta we got here?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Like an elephant.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Luke. Where you goin?
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
That fool. That damn fool.
Kick a buck.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
It's good medicine.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
What Friday?
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
Who is this?
You're calling me a crank?
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Who?
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Is it an ongoing case?
We'll show that to...
Then what do you need me for?
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
I heard. Good police work.
Just horseshit luck.
I like women like that!
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
You're not envious?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
One of your suitors?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
No.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
What?
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Letty.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
What if it's got a pattern?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
For a price.
A small price.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
What else would you do?
Then it's over.
Michael, I...
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Tell me all.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Not yet.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
Are you OK?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I guess so.
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
Especially now.
Who?
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Yeah.   We just go home.
Why not just steal another one?
Because you're the closest.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
That moron.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
Good idea.
All right, knock it off.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Everything?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
What hotel?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
There has to be.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I'll drive.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
It's my idea.
It's good.
The hell it is.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Uh huh.
How are we going to do that?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
It's for you.
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
On guard!
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
And if I use them to kill you?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
You're not married, are you?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Let's end this here.
What do you want?
Jen...
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
Have you questioned him yet?
Then, why did you come?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Care for a hot dog?
No onions?
Mister Funboy.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I can see her.
Miss her?
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
I don't think so.
I'll be fine.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Junior.
No.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
How are you today?
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Need any company?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Am I bothering you?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
I just came to say goodbye.
Hi.
I'm sorry about that.
Any ideas who it could be?
Greg McConnell.
Are you shitting me?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Okay.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
I don't know.
Well... not exactly.
I did?
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
That's one way of looking at it.
Excellent.
You think he'll like it?
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Want to join me?
Same time next week?
Yummy.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
No.
One.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
I'll think about it...
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Loser.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Any day now.
Yippy.
Shut up.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
With who?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Kind of.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Ronald?
To my triumph, of course.
Come again?
I think you have your answer.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
What about her?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Do you know when she'll be back?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Yes, you already did.
What time is it?
Nope.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
What do you mean?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
I got my wish anyway.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I think I should.  3000W?
Something's haywire,
You're shouting at me.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Certain wishes do.
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Daddy!
No.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
But why?
A lady threw it to me.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
I'm trying to.
But she's such a nice lady.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
And does he kill people?
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
And Amy mailed them?
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
I've been working out.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
I mean where on your body?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Hey, did you get contacts?
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
I think he called you beautiful.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Hello?
DON'T call the police.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
I think I just got my period.
I'm cleaning my stove.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
I guess you'll find out.
About Mark? Carlton?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Knock what off?
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
You look different. I mean you look good.
So pay them back and apologize.
Oh, it's nothing.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Briefs.
No, why?
Is it that funny?
They do? Oh no...
Peter I love you too but...
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You're some catch Lloyd.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
What?
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
We only live a few blocks apart.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
What are you talking about?
What's he doing here?
The other one?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Good.
Who is it?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
You see it?
Shut up!
You know something about me?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Horrible...
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
A month.
I'm not certain about...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
The Washington Post.
That shelter was in this bill.
Alan
Choices???
I can't believe he'd do this.
We think so.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
It's a homeless shelter.
What are you gonna do?
He's only doing what you told him to.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Oh my God...
Will he be alright?
No.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Why?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
This is from the people of Burundi...
I can't say.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
`Bleed for your king.'
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
That was quite a thing you did today.
You're leaving?
I don't mind.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
So what do you do the rest of the time?
I know.
What about the intro?
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
How long do we have to watch him?
NOOOOOOOOO!
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
What'dya get?
It will?  How do you figure?
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yes sir.
But...
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
No.
What are you doing?!
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
No.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Uh-huh.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
YAWP!
A madman.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh..
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Put more into it!
How do we get out of here?
He's the owner...
They are...they are everywhere.
You're going to have to get a new one.
Who gives a shit about aft?
That's where my boat's moored.
Maybe we lost them.
The thieves.
The "come back" kind.
A meat locker.
Yeah...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
I think he knows that Joey.
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
What is it man?
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
She fucked me too.
You want 'em?
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Yes, Albert?
Damn right!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
What the --!
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
I know! I fuckin' know!
That's new, isn't it?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
I have to go.
No. None of that.
Yeah.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
You mean...?
Yeah?
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Where's it gone?
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Nick, she won't say why.
You Biederman?
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Biederman!
What kind of beer would you like?
You're going hunting?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
I'm just so lonely.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
From Nam?
What are you, God?
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
We gotta play with more bullets.
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
No.
No.
What's that noise?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
No.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Never one.
You're full of shit!
Yeah.
The fuck I did!!!
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
What's this?
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
How do I look?
Need help?
Not the 'T' word.
You my partner?
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
They're going to rob that bank.
Can I ask you something?
How then?
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.
Hey, I'm eating.
Yes, sir.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Hi.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
I didn't.
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
But I like the new one better.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Now run along, Daniel.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Oh!
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
Tired?
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
Why don't they come --
Mary! Come back ...
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Come in, Sheriff.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Just someone from New Hampshire!
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Me?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Where are you going?
Ellis, what have you told them?
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
I'm a cop from New York.
Put it down now.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
...I've missed you.						*
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
'Roy'.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
I'm here, cowboy.
This is --
No.  I never smile any more.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
How are you doing?
Yeah.  So how are you?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
I'm sorry...
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
Where you gonna go?
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Look... who's on the phone?
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Do you still want the operation?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
He's makin' threats in there.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
Who's this?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
What is it, Sam?
No, not until after they killed him.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
Let's go, Sonny.
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I am.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
I forgot she's in here.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Did Pop come down?
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
What is it, Choco?
What?
Hello?
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
Okay.
I've already formulated a plan.
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Cunt.
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Cool it, Choco.
No. What's the big deal?
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Talk to me.
Ya back is got.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Did you ask Sal?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
I didn't.
Gotta go.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Wake up!
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Yo, I'm gone.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
He's just being nice.
Nice!
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
...peanuts.
I'll do.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
C Duracell.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Can ya dig it?
What?
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Depends.
Can you pay me now?
I would like to get paid now.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Where are you going?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Just coolin'.
You deaf or what?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
Ya like him, huh?
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I don't know.
I love you.
Hey!  Watch it.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Four colors? Neato!
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Ooh gross.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
The name's Walter.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
Collins is a great man!
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
You're it.
You're it.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
How do you know it's for us?
Who's your partner?
You can't marry my mom.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
A raft.
Hey, it's Jessica.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
What? What did we do?
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
Sorry, Charlie.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
What are you doing here?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
What?
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
How was that?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
And...?
Knock knock.
Who's there?
So what do you keep in there?
My Lord!
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
So, this is Leto the Just...
Yes, Sire.
My Lord?
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Will we see a worm?
What's in the box?
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Those sounds could be imitated.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
It is my home.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Do you want me to get it for you?
I don't understand.
Who do I play?
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Let me take you to the hospital.
You'll be sitting on the right.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Last night was quite a romp.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Um, okay... roll camera
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Isn't he?
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
You met Basil Rathbone!
It's a damn good role.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
I'm no good.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
You're a fuckin' mess.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Would that work?
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Yes?
Could we moovf to table?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Is there a script?
Are you a fruit?
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
No! I love sex with girls.
Oh.  Okay.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Huh?!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
Wow.
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Isn't that the same thing?
Yeah, so... ?
Yes!
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Yeah.
What if Shari's the dream?
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Mr. Pekurny.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Right, right...
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
What's the difference?
What?
But Al is your husband now!
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Hi, Mom. 
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Are you sure about this?
Go!
What are you doing?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Shari...
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
Where were you?
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
You're in show business?
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Who is it?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Look, we gotta talk.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
You know what your problem is?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
How'd it go?
Mostly Tammy fans
Looks good to me.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Uh-huh.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
And when did you do it?
Exactly when?
Which door?
Could you get this? I can't
Yep.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Okay, let's say
I'm not like you.
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
What's it to you?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Captain, what do you want?
How what, Wendell?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Dudley's guys.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
What?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
What little studio?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
What do you mean?
Say what and so what.
I never truck with no sissies!
They shot him in his library.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
White's a mindless thug.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
What's on the call sheet?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
Sid, how are they hanging?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
What'd he give to you?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Listen to me--
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
A direct one.
Who are they?
What do they have to do with this?
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Wait. What do I do?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What'd I tell you?
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
I intercepted phone calls.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Yeah.
What the fuck?!
Drive.
What about newspapers and magazines?
So what do we do now?
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
Listen--
Reynolds.
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Oh my God.
Is it okay?
Do you see anything you like?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
I know, but--
Because my life is being ruined.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
To buy lingerie.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Have you been working with Rachel?
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
Robert--
I've seen it.
You <u>swore</u>!
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I was missing you.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
How's the trout?
Brill?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Other than Brill.
Other than me.
You're not.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
That's temporary.
I can't.
We'd rather not--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Seat 74.
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Dad!
Where've you been?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Who won the fight?
Did they take your clothes?
What about jewelry?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Bobby--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Jerry?
Yeah.
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
We found the originals.
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
No sir.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
What about the tape?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Now is that clear?
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
As the wife of one of our party.
What am I looking at?
This is not very good, is it?
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Don't.
Now.
This is - what is this?
It's a folk song.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Shall we be all right?
Dance with me.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Don't talk.
Oh dear.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
So you can shoot a pistol?
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Where did you find that?
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
Well, then ask him his name!
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
I see.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
What did you say?
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Candaules
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
I can already see.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
I'm still here.
I'm not sewing anything else.
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
You get Hardy.
What are you up to?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
It's what I've learned.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Go away.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
How awful.  What will you do?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
I'll come with you.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
What are you talking about?
Why?  Are you German?
We've got to catch him in the act.
You don't call, you don't write.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
I don't want to waste your time.
You have a car?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Do you mind?
For God's sake.
But Roki said--
We going somewhere?
And--
I go in alone.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
That's because I wanted them to!
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
To us. To the Mask.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
And--
You can't be too careful.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Yes. Yes.
What about the rules?
The eight billion. From them to us.
Peoples China Bank.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
There's always a surprise.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Jesus God, it's going through.
The disc is still in there.
Jesus.
The key to success is using the right tools.
This is big enough.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
What's she doing here?
All of 'em?
Which one?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yes?
You're a lawyer?
Right.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
So what made you think it was?
What medical records?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
What?  Who?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
So what are you thinking?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Why not?
Fuck Kurt.
Say you were wrong.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I guess I did.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Nope.  Maiden.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Have you been to the water board?
Yeah.  A real moron.
Yeah.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Ten?
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
What?  But you been working so hard --
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
What's that?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
And I miss you.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Where's my paycheck?
What?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
What?
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
You know the Jedi Master?
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
Our destruction?  Who?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Sit down, and shut up!
What are you so grouchy about?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
They're moving away.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Never heard of that system.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
What are you staring at?
I was worried about you.
Thanks to you.
About what?
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
We have no use for your kind.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Jabba the Hutt?
Why not me?
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Do you have a name?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?
Go easy, Stevie.
Humans?
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
You told me he was dead.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
All right, so I made another deal.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
A medical team will be standing by.
75% power.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Where are they?
Where is it?
Me too?
Yeah, kinda.
Looking to get out.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Don't follow me.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Of Merlin?
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Father...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Why can't you be my champion?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
Why?
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I?
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Hello?
Here.
Just five or six people.
What is it?
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, she'd love it.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
She is going to be well?
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
And those lies she's been telling?
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
He didn't mention?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Where's Regan's father?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Oh look at that.
You like it?
Hey, where'd this come from?
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Captain Howdy.
Regan, why are you reading that?
Well you know it's okay.
You like him.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
So something please Doctor, Help her!
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Hi Chris. Great party.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Do it again.
In time.
What's that?
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
No.
No momma.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
Shut up!!
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
I don't know.
Give me the keys!
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Honey ...
Beasley.
They're falling out.
They gotta go.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Huh?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You got weird kids, Frank.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
No thanks.
You gotta go.
Frank?
I don't know what you mean.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Sure, why not.
Let's get it over with.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
Yeah, fine.
You recognized me.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
He's drunk.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Okay.
No, you take the right.
All night?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
We're not getting paid then.
What's it for?
I don't know.
What channels it on?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Jack!
How're your hands?
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
So she's got a few sniffles.
So run a little longer.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Changed?
It's orange!
Come on.  We don't have much time.
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
Uh... good.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
You two could play checkers.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Great?
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
I can't sing it anymore.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Don't worry about it.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
The name's Baker --
He leads, I follow.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
The Stratford.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
How do you do it? Every night?
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
Nina?
He called her.
Long story.
You're kidding.
You can always get another girl.
Another five years, huh?
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
What did he do?
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
What do you mean?
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
-- Castor?
They're too tight.
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Get rid of them.
Commander, what are you doing here?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
What about me?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
You're wearing your suit --
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
Oh, that Karl.
Excuse me?
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
And I know people.
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
Mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Got it.  Good tip.
Maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
She is relentless.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Hey, is that really necessary?
It’s me, Jack...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Where’s my car?!  Where’s my Ferrari!?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Yes you do...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Why not?
You can’t do this. You can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
Are we finally being honest?
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
What kind of man does that!?
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Why not?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Wait a second.  You want me, don’t you?
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
Well...Annie for one.
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
Say it, Jack...
You really are incredible...
But you always seem so certain.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
Think bigger.
Annie goes to a great school.
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I don't think She's real big on hate.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
What did you wish for, honey?
About me?  How sweet.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Yes, thanks.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
For science.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
What are you doing?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
You <u>were</u>?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
What are you doing?
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
-- and why we need you.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Yes, Alan.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Difficult? He's impossible!
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Doctor, what's wrong?
We can't take a second more.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
What about Dr. Michaels?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You have no right to blame Duval --
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Then don't drift down further.
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
What's this, sir?
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, geez.
...The heck d'ya mean?
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
Ya got that right.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Uh-huh... A what?
Can you be any more specific?
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Yeah!
...Yah, okay...
Huh? Yah?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Okay.
Where're you going?
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Yah.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Well, they -
Where is everybody?
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Well, how the heck are ya?
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
No, I didn't...
I'm sorry, Mike.
I always liked ya so much...
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
What'd he say?
Yah.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Not on your feet too much?
...So?
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
I'm tellin' ya.
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Oh.
Does this sound strange to you?
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
I'd like to thank the academy...
It becomes an addiction.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Looks like this is goodbye.
How did you find me?
Really?
Look, this is a bad time...
So you're staying in tonight?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
You feel nothing?
Do you care?
... A person.
Can I come in?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Marla...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
Tell the other person how you feel.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
There's always that.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
They're called "cigarette burns."
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Huh?
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Look at your hand.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
I feel sick.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
What?
... is over.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You want out?
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb?
Why... why... why... ?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
I swear on my life, I won't...
Maintenance.
Excuse me?
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
You have to tell us now.
You were there?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Another premonition?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
I'm not following you --
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
How do you know?
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
What feeling?
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
I don't.
You're the fuckin' devil.
What are you doing?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Yeah.  Why not?
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
How you doing, Brewer?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
That guy's not going to make it.
Are they going to torture us?
You're gonna love it.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Look, Co...
Not yet.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Typical...
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Let's do it.
My parents were divorced.
Well, there's nobody special!
No really..I can't.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
He's not a moron.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
See, I told you!
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Tragedy?
I... I was just leaving.
.....Me neither.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
So how do we do this?
Now what?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Have I died?
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
That's O.K.
Well what am I gonna do with it?
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Who?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
No, I...
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Serveza yourself!
Yes.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Who?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
What?
Maybe you better stay, then.
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Look at that.
That's dangerous, you know.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
You think I'm a fake.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
That's three games to none, Carl.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
It is true.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Fine.
Look at me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Who are you?
Nothin'.
I, umm, came to see you.
Of course.
So wadda you do with your girls?
You look good.
I kissed those girls.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
She fucks it all up!
What are you going that way for?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
Yo! What you goin' for
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Probably.  One of the many.
God I admire you.
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Would you like me to change anything?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
What?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Ask anybody.
So where do you know Alan from?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Breathe easy...
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
No idea.
You find the source?
Where am I?
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
You may be right.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Cash. I'm impressed.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Then he has.
Right.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Why are they after you?
That's Brazil.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Do you have a passport?
'Magic' today, huh?
Shoot.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Thanks.
Yeah.
His bride. Cute as a button.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
John who?
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Hi.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
How do you know about that?
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
Act natural.
Don't worry, I can take it.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
They just left, sir.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Cabana one.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Your call is come through.
I commend him on his choice.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Irwin...
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Just give me a hint, all right?
How could you call him?
You were going to can me, right?
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Oh... I have some questions.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
You okay?
Aha, just what I suspected!
Hey, they blew me.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
I tried to help you...!
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Polo.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Fine!
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute.  You're funny.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
No - no.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
What's your name, asshole?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Il est en retard.
What happens to the schedule?
We must follow it.
He is not wrong.
He got off on six.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Yeah!
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
What is that old building?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Butch called.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Frank...what's wrong?
I love you, Bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
No, I don't.
About what?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
Uh huh...
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
29 years...?
What the hell...
How could this be happening?
Sun spot?
I think I'm losing you.
On the job?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
My father didn't die in a fire?
You used to be on the job?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
You're all just jealous.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
What's this?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Did you stay here last night?
This is too painful to look at.
And, what about us?
What happened that night?
Hi.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
Never should've let her play.
But, Dad, we...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Uh...yes.  But...
Wait a minute. I just...
Where'd you get this?
Why?
Boy scouting.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Why didn't you cremate him?!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I'm here.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Good night, beautiful.
You're talking about my lady.
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
I'm now begging you.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
About Jessica.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
Never.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
But she might be in trouble...
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Well...how do you feel?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Hi, Sean.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
Can he really take us home?
Elliot?
She wants a divorce.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
That's awful.
What was it like?
Do not inhale.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
It's your best play, Nicky.
This could be it.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
We're able to surprise each other.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
What else?
Two-all after six.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
Joanne Bourne.
I am really, deeply sorry.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
They're only gonna lose.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I know, Pop.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Oh yeah?
A grandmother. God bless you.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
It's a complicated subject.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
Why do you care?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
And the Father replies?
And he has finer moments now and then.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
A little drastic maybe?
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Someone waiting for you?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
I haven't come to you.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Enough.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a man of God.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
"Hell!"
What do you want?
You've done me a great service.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Have you read his magazine?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
Er, no...
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
That's the last.
Something's not right.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
What are you waiting for?
Often.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
You okay, Jerome?
You had to be a right-hander.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
Call German.
Come on--we're taking off.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Where are you taking her?
In case you get back before I do.

What about the car?
My medication.  I left it back there.
I'll take care of my end.
What about your wife?
We'll try again.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Better than old times.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
$250,000 right off the top.
Is he straight?
I couldn't have... much longer.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
I mean it.
Why didn't you tell me?
A man helped me open it...
He must have.
I can handle it.
What do you want to do?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
I want to say something.
You want to try with me?
You and me.
I don't know.
So what?
Who was it?
Are we going to make it?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Can I help you?
Gonna knock down a wall?
You were with him?
What about the vault?
What do you have in mind?
He took the day off.
What's it to you?
That's what I want.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I've got to stop.
What do you want?
What about?
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Why?
Why?
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
No, don't Jack, don't.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Yes.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
And what was that?
Is he coming here?
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Working at Woolworths.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
I mean, what for?
It just would. He was always the same.
Since when did he drink whisky?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
You're a bastard.
Meaning what?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Yeah.
What's that? A hundred?
All right. Two hundred.
...Polacks...
You ever get 'em?
They killed the goose.
...this shit...
Some contest board...
Who?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
That's what I...
They...
They have...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
We're just "talking" about it.
Yes.
What?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
I'm sorry?
Yes.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Yes.  I'm sure.
...you don't have to come in...
...I thought that we were only talking...
In the abstract...
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Uh-huh.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
It's a waste of time.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Why don't you think so?
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Will you excuse...
Did they...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Who used to say that?
What?
Would you excuse us, please...?
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Could I...
...no...
...do you want to go downtown...?
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Murray...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
Then put me on the board.
And what if you don't close.
Not lately you can't...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Why?
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
Excuse me...
Well, hadn't it?
You robbed the office.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Abso...
The check's no good?
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
I'm sorry.
When?
...yes...
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Me.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Gimlet.
Three days.
I'm not.
I'm...
You cashed the check?
They got, listen to me...
You closed him yesterday.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
I have the stuff from last year's...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
John...
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Do you like them?
I'm not hungry.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
We have no money for a rug.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
You're not my father!
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
The children can stay.
Goddamn bitch.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
I never met them.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
We have time.
I've always taken care of you.
He's an Italian?
 And he agreed?
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Am I a prisoner?
Kay... Kay...
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
Where's my wife?
Rocco!
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
What was it, so I'll know.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
No questions.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Yeah, but don't worry.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
What the hell are you talking about?
Do you gamble?
Do you owe markers?
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Senator Kane.
Whose orders are these?
Sleeping inside me.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
There are still things I have to do.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
You were unfair with them.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
I'm not married.
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
Mornin'.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
What did she mean by going flooey?
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
I liked it.  We all did.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Does that surprise you?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I never thought you were.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
How long were you...?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
It's not like her.
Is that --?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
A very lucky thing indeed.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
What won't do?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
What was that?
Just take off the fucking mask!
You okay?
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
Yes.  Perfectly.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
More your line.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
Your father was a schoolmaster?
I was going to take a swim.
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
One more night --
No...
I'm on the move -
Your girl works in there ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
C'mon, man ...
How you doing, man?
Most of 'em are late-model...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Any more ...
Yeah ...
Cool. So you're living up North?
Nah. It's a scratch.
So what are you gonna do?
About what?
What are you doing here?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
What are you doing here?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
Now what -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
Where we going -- ?
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
What's wrong with her -- ?
That what you want?
Ready -- ?
No worries ...
Hello, Otto ...
Tell me...
And the moral of that story is -- ?
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Who's "Eleanor?"
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Not really -
Not really --
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Tell him. It's okay.
Anybody!  You understand?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
My bag. My bag.
Jezuz Christ!
We've got to help each other.
What happened? You okay?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
I gotta talk to you.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
There are cops all over the place.
Nah.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
Yeah, yeah.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
She's sharp as a marble.
Why not?
Thanks, Chuck.
Gone.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
You and Morgan throw?
No, I had to talk him down.
What class?
Oh...
Hi.
--That isn't funny--
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
Some other guy?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
You want us to give you cash right now?
That's one aspect of what we do.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Fuck do you want?
Really?
Okay. How?
I think so.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
Will.
So who won the bet?
I didn't see you at the reunion.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
--And confuse him--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
He won't be a failure!
Why there?
I got one of those too.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
About thirty million to one.
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
What's the point?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
I might understand that.
That's very presumptuous.
What did you think?
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
How'd it go?
Well, are you going out again?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
The wrench, why?
It's not your fault.
I know.
Which one did you take, Will?
I'm Will.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Yeah.
Not a chance.
I swear to God.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
No.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
What?
I know. I just do.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
No, you don't want to hear that.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Any gas?
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
How many men?
Two.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
What you figger to do?
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
Casy! What you doin' here?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
I didn't mean nothing.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Well?
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
But what about this?
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
What do you do?
It's what I do.
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Remember high school?
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
I'm a professional killer.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Seven it is.
As long as I get the laugh.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Like love?
Yes.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Will you come with me?
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
You don't understand...
Say more.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Yes.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
No.
Okay.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
It's fine.
You have a headache?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Of course you will.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Ten years. What happened!?
He sells BMW's?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
That's too bad.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Whatever you want.
Would you like to see that?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
Did you ask him to come visit?
I'll come.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Who is it?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I should go get some of her things.
You've got to stop doing that?
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
You've already made arrangements!?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Huh-huh. You?
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
No. I am a "tubab."
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
Where does this go, Diane?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
She calls him Tommy...
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Of course not.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
That's what some folks say.
I don't believe it.
Tom?
Don't you go to school?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
Yeah?
She's an editor.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Jude, you okay?
IT WAS MY TURN!
What stuff is that?
Now that's cool.
Yeah, cool.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Damn!
I want it to have my children!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
And what's he do?
Dead.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
No. No one special.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
I'm Crash Override.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Dade.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
What's happening?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Mr. Belford?
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
What is it? What's wrong?
Purpose of visit?
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Real charmer.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
What's going on?
Not without Jamie.
Shit!
Go!
Mom, please
Found it.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Honey, I don't think their home.
Why shouldn't I?
Four plus Myers.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
Double scoops?
Hi.
Jamie, what happened?
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie, wait for me.
You don't believe that do you?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't look pushy.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
What are we doing?
Why?
Oh Christ. Doc...
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Sure.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
He can still watch.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Fancy.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
I wonder where they went.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Jesus!
You all right?
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Where?
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
After the movie.
What did he look like?
I saw him...
Laurie, you come with us...
I'm scared!
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
PROBABLY going.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
Ever done anything like this before?
What did he say?
...any sister talk?
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Wow, it's the red one?
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Now I ca-can't remember.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
And it's just in one ear?
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Yeah?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No, I don't think so.
Well, thanks a lot.
Oh.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Oh!
I was looking for you.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
You bet.
Where're you going?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I didn't say that.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
I think they're fantastic.
Oh, great.
Do you miss Frederick?
I think he'll find that satisfying.
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Mh-hm.
Hey!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
What?  You're kidding!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
So how are you?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
No, I haven't.
Oh.  Oh.
Really?
Oh, God!
Oh, wow!
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, yeah?  What?
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Why are you so upset?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
We could skip the Gavotte.
Say it in English.
Then who's buying it?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
And who is "they?"
How you doin?
How was America?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Impossible.
First things first.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Seen what, sir..?
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
No. 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
Yes.  How did you know?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
How could you know?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
...long overdue.
...Franklin.
Make them eat the figurine.
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
...might I make a suggestion...?
You want another drink, honey...?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I am on the track of...
Then we cannot go.
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
For approval.
What is your point?
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
Man, she's losing it...
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Your Secret admirer?
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
Oh, I have to hear this.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
I was talking with someone!
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
I said I was sorry.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
I don't really like your friends either.
S'okay....
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
We killed them, didn't we?
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
Answer him dick!
Let's kick his ass.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
How was the funeral?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
That's three things.
But my name's not...
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
What's that?
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
Come on, sit up.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
I shall call him Diello.
What??
John has fallen in love with me!
I'm coming with you.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
I understand... I won't-
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Thanks.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Do you know where you are?
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
What things do you think you've done?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Last week...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
Bernie, how'sa kid?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Turn that thing off.
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Lie, you mean...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Yes.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
"A little mistake"!
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
He's pretty... remarkable.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
And the rent is okay?
-- hospital.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
Oh, great.
Do you have a family?
Why are you mad at each other?
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Here, take this out to the table.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What?
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
How were we -- were we cool?
Did you hear what he said?
How was lunch?
Oh -- great.
No.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
The cab's waiting!
What about cable?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
No.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Promise?
I'd like that.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Central Park.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
That's all?
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
I'm leaving.
Thank you, Thomas.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
This cannot be.
Leaving?  For how long?
I cannot explain.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
If it's good advice.
I'll be fine.
You didn't answer my question.
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
On the back it has--
How could they get by him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
No.  The money, please.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
What?
He needs a doctor.
Use more ice.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
I overheard him with the girl.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Donuts here any good?
Are you out of your mind?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
Where is it?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Kevin left without you.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
What do you want?
What happened?
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Go.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
What's wrong with the radio?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's right in front of us.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
What?
He has lots of disks.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
I guess we each have something the other wants.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
We, who is we?
Who are you?
And four children?
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
You said you had no whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
You fucking see that!
Here, have a sandwich.
Very soon.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Perfect timing.
You are the manager?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
Our cards, please.
What cards?
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
What about us?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What does it matter.
I want to know.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
What's wrong?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
Where has all our beer gone?
Paul, are you there?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Jesus H. Christ!
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
This thing's going nowhere.
-- I did: down here.
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
What? Deep down inside?
Why not?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
This is the best we're gonna do.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
You've got your own TV show?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
You're hurting me.
-- the sadistic prick --
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
No, no, it's just --
What?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
House 2, Guests 0.
-- the window and door grates --
-- confirming everything we already know --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Don't know that it does.
Believe me, we need to.
Excuse me?
What will they tell you?
She's down...
Why?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
What are you talking about?
She's gone!
I'm fine.
What?
Maura, what is this!
It was a shame.
Why?
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Thank you.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
A prize?  For what?
Wow.  Thank you.
You're apologizing?
I miss you too.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
But I said I was sorry....
Count of three?
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Welcome to Rome, sir.
My life is not some deal.  I...
Don't you just hate kids...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
A little petting is not the issue!
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
What have you been doing?
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Cat got his tongue?
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Thanks for sharing.
Why does this have to be so hard...
Something short.
The Daddy-Oh!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
About seven minutes.
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Confused?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
...I'm sorry.
I know that, Amy.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
What a beautiful thought.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Phony, huh?
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Awwww, buddy --
...You don't?
...It is?
And Sid says you stole it!
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Norville.
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Yeah?
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
You're fired.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Damnit, where's my car!
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She finds him.
...Her mother needs an operation...
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
Where?
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
I think you need some help.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
She can never be cured?
You're single?
Yes.
But it's so far away...
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
A mental case?
I've never given it much thought.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You want that?
What about her?
In other words, I'm on trial.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
I'm, uh, going to bed.
So early?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
I... I think I am...
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
You think I --
What do you mean?
I'm not surprised.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
That this was going to be a key party?
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Fascist!
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
A key party?
Thank you Janey.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Here you are.
Forget what?
You ask what the point is?
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Um, Libbets Casey.
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
You going to tell dad?
Yeah.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Who said so?
Yeah?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Hello, Charles.
And?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Right.
Hey Wendy.
The ones you built?
He's dead.
It feels warm.
Yes, sir.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
You did your homework, Officer.
Who's that?
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
No.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
What happened at that signing?
Did she?
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
No way.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Will.
Huh?
After that she left the party to go to him.
Thought I smelled something.
Who?
What was it?
Thought you might find that.
But she was an attractive girl.
You gave her gifts.
What the hell do you know?
Where's your back-up?
Your lips, they didn't move.
You said there were none.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Your melancholy eyes...
More.
I didn't realise.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
And you never cried -
How do I look?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
What do you mean?
You want death? Is it death you want?
As did the one who made me.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Lestat!
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
But why did you tell her?
You promise to care for her then?
Is that bad?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
No.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
Karaoke -- perfect.
Don't even think about it.
Yes.
Nice move.
Cancer in a box.
Karla!
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Voodoo.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Oooh, the mainland --
Hello?
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Why? He can't help us.
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Cool.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
Can't talk right now.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Drunk again?
We will see who is the first to die.
) You feel the symptoms?
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
What are you doing?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
I have forgotten it, dear.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
What would I be thinking?
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
Really, this is idiotic!
I don't understand you.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Her family name?
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Hero?
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
He hates all my race.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Well, naturally. Of course.
Splendid! Is he sick?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Big –– see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
I'm all right.
Well then, how do you know?
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
George! George!
Anything I can do back here?
Maybe you were born older, George.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Violet Bick!
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Why didn't you call me?
Just a minute –– just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Eighteen.
Too young or too old?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
About what?
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Huh?
My hair's getting wet!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
I can't wait to get there.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Don't!
We better go back in.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
We're carrying weight.
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
Sean!   Catch the rope!
I never heard of a 908.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Do I have to?
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Too late, it's written.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
We don't know that, do we?
What makes you think there might be?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Fooling around?
Mmmm.
Sean's awake.
For me?
I know what you're going to say.
Do you?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What're you doing?
We're alone.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
It's still a good idea.
Two of them are still missing!
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Terry!  You okay?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's a crock of shit.
No class.
What's that mean?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Not tonight.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Eat Cheerios.
You're going sailing.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Go on, Doctor.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Thank you.
Hope I make it through both.
That macho pompous English --
Honey, I gotta go.
You called, Doctor?
Are you scared?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Make up your mind.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
You want me to stay?
Finally.
Come on.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
But you --
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I thought they were clever.
How's sleeping beauty?
Should be coming out of it soon.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
That's because I am the shark.
When did this happen?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
'Course they're also so rich.
Are you really?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
Now what?
Buzz off.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
The world's southern most reaches.
Reach for the limit I always say.
That's impossible.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Sure.
You want to show this?
Come on, sweetheart....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Can I make sandwiches...?
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Yes, I did.
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
Make a list.
Then don't come any closer.
Close the door.
Beginning of what?
We'll be there....
Are you all right?
The fish.  Check it....
Can I ride one sometime...?
I like Grandma's cooking....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
All you all right?
Okay.
Nothing out of the ordinary....
You're not a pain in the ass....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
There's nothing to worry about....
It got him....
Why'd you come out here?
I can't....
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
You're not going to bet it all....
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
Why?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Still chasing fish?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
They put bombs on dolphins....
I am...You must know something about him....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I'm coming...How close is it?
I don't like it....
I didn't ask you to....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Then give me that Zippo.
What do you want it for?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Sure.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Bits.
You ain't going in alone?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
What are you looking for?
Yes, Sir.
No.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
No.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Two or three years ago.
You want something, darling?
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Okay, this is working.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Oh Jerry.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Now what did you lose?
You think so?
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Hello?
We are?
Thanks.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Oh God.
It's my fault.
You want...
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
Denver is where he should be.
Mmm.  Hmm.
Yes.
I got it.
At last I find you.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
No.
--  the kwan.
Great word.  Towel?
How do I know?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Jerry!  You made it --
I have to ask.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Oh, tell the story.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Don't be silly.
Pardon me?
You'll lose.
Funny.
I'm scared.  What is it?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Oh, my God.
What?
Her new boyfriend.
You hate to swim.
That's him. That’s Eric!
It's not safe.
I don't remember
What?...WHAT!?
You couldn't have made that jump.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You mean it?
PAUL!
Where's Dad?
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
I don’t know.
Eric!
We could co-write a paper.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
I want to be an astronaut.
We're safe!
That's hard to believe.
Amanda!
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
You are an academic.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
What?
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
How close do you have to be?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
What?
What is that?
Do you see any family resemblance here?
What do they want?!
No.
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
What now?
They are?  I'll be damned.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - like birds - -
Dr. Grant!
No. We can't.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Listen, ahh - -
Tim.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You're sure?!
We gotta do something.
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
It's safe?
Please!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Your silence intrigues me.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
That's not funny.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Hello?
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
Who?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
Fascinating.
Yeah, what is it?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
How's that possible?
Where's he going?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
What happened? Where's Jason?
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
Will you do me a favor then?
Another one?
It's my last and final one.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
You wanted to see me, sir.
Well, I --
In a small way.
What's funny?
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
What of it?
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
What's the matter with you?
-- Just doing our job.
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
I could always apply there.
You look tired.
Get the hell out of here.''!
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Did you see her?
Did you fear for your life?
Are you gonna start it up?
What's that?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Why? She's a junkie.
Sure dear, yes.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
What? This?
Can't you get him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
No.
And I don't think that was Tom.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
You and I -- a relationship.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Where, how?
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Some mistake perhaps that --
It's in the report.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
We grew up together. Kids.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Show.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
No.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Yep.
Did mommy ever see this?
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Yes.
No.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Is that...permanent?
Were you?
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
What about Billy?
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Ted, do you love him?
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Only can I still see him?
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Wow!
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
And?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
What?!  She wants what?!
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
No, but--
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Three.  And add some basil.
No.  I don't think so.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
But, I am in charge.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Did you receive the letter?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
I am afraid.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
I accept it. What is suffering?
Will we be in this war?
No. This war is almost over.
Where is Alsace?
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
Britain chooses not to.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
You will always!
It is a story, you decide.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
I do.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
We cannot.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
You killed him.
I'll sue you.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
They could try to tranq him on land.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Never been to Maine before?
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
In Maine?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
You okay?  Kelly?
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Okay.
He's mooing.
We gotta get to Hector!!
Well...
If I'm ever in New York...
No.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
We set?
You talk to the married couple?
I got nothing against--
Was he swallowed?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
With what?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
What is this?
Are you okay?
Did you get him?
I had a great time last night. Again.
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
It's ten after nine.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Sorry?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
No. He won't come after me.
Why not?
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
You're all right! Where is he?
Get me out!
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Yes sir.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
And the questionnaire...?
Then please - do this test for me.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
A moth... How did you predict that?
Killed outright?
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Why so briefly?
No.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
He kills w-
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
So you ran away...
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Yes...
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
What...?
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
Are we safe?
You still have an aversion to the water?
One called Magua arrived.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Who were these people?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Le mot d'ordre?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
He did.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Be careful with it.
Doc eat already?
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
Your suit, Becky!
You did good...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Sixpack?
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Okay.
And it killed Bo?
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
You got money in this tub?
Yes sir...
You read Russian?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
You let him get away!
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
What's wrong?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I thought this was a pub.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
I don't know what you mean.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Son, have a look in his locker.
What are you doing?
It's not him, Dad.
Right, his leg's going now.
Out the back.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
You got it all?
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
I'll see ya.
I like your bar.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
At what, exactly?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
What do you mean?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
Please.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
I do, sir.
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
We're not running a dating service here.
Sergeant?
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Skinny?
Nice job.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
What's that for?
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
You little pissant--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Something like that.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
You get much of that in here?
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
This girl is a friend of yours?
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Seems like we have another one every week.
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
No.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
Fellas.
Sam--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Thank you.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
And my father?
Of course you can.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
They've got my Amado.
We haven't talked since high school.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Most people did, yeah.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
You've got your mother, your kids--
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
How long have you lived here?
Yeah?
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
We start from scratch--
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
You'd do a good job.
You don't need to cuff me.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
So when did Buddy leave?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Please.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Will you come to him on your knees?
And are you afraid?
Did your husband know Quaid?
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Harry.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
When do you want me to start?
They won't tell you anything.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
No.
You said you weren't with him for love.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Yes.
I've got to help him.
Don't look.
Good.  There.  Yes?
Somebody killed him.
You believe that?
Oh, I've got plenty.
What are you, my mother?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Why'd you come here?
I like to know why things happen.
D'Amour --
We've got to get you to a hospital.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
What about?
My God.
Have you been in?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
I did it for Dorothea.
Oh yeah?
Oh Jeez.
Is that all?
This is where we killed him.
Can you do it?
I don't know.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Is he the Puritan?
And he's dead?
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
You'll do it?
What are you doing here?
What about you? Why are you here?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
What do you do?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
Hi again, how's it going?
Hans was very attentive to you.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
No, I was looking at you.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
No, yes, it does...
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
And marriage, does that get easier?
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
You think so?
Do you ever see him?
Yes.
Do you like massage?
Lydia?
That's not what I'm talking about.
Is there anything I can do?
You know, eat healthier.
Oh, come on.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
It's ok.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Do you want I send it to your room?
Hospital?
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Hmmm.
Yeah, like...
What're these?
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
I can take care of myself.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
You'll do it?
He spoke to you?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
What's that got to do with you?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
So...what did you think of the tape.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
And the point is?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I don't understand what's going on.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
Nothing yet.
You have to say that.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
A lot of good that'll do.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You know what?  You can go.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Yeah.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Need any help?
Engaged.
She's alright.
Okay.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Gotta wait til the press conference.
No.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
Mom tell you to do this?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
What?
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
You were trying to make me look bad.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
I don't know.  A lot.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
What do I have to do?
Oh.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Your legs don't look broke.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Would you watch the damn road?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Why not?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
You weren't at my game.
I never asked you to choose.
Never had to.
Yup.
What are the doctors saying?
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Not for Quincy McCall.
We won the championship.
Funny.  I never did.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
One game.  One-on-one.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You know, people.
What?
Sorry.
We need to talk.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Yeah, hey. Chad.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Honey.
Yes.
You take cream or sugar?
yeah, good, ok.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Well...is that illegal?
Eight o'clock?
You wanna make a deal with me?
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
You don't know how crazy I am.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Claudia.
Ready to go,go,go?
Sure, why?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
What's up?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Braces?
Yes I do.
I've been a good worker --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Where is he?
Get a girlfriend.
She loves you.
Yeah.
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
Who?
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
No.
All it takes is one second?
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
Is that still lingering?
In aid of what?
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
Does you mother still work?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Is Linda here?
About three weeks ago.
Calm down.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
I AM CALM.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
You're here.
Ok. What's your name?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
Been drinkin' today?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
As fast as I can.
Was there anyone that I know?
No one else that I know?
How long with Paula?
...say it, Jimmy...
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
I really don't know.
I don't know what I've done.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
Do you still have to do homework?
They look pretty smart, I think.
You don't want any water?
Are you on drugs right now?
Shut the fuck up.
Linda --
Hang up the phone.
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
mmmhmm.
Pink Dot.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Bottled Water?
Do you have that?
Yes. What? Yes.
We need more dog food --
I'm fine. nothing.
Go to bed.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
You can do it.
Hang himself?!
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
A simple theological discussion.
No!  Stop --
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
And why are you so glum?
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
D'Artagnan, unready?
Do I look all right?
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
But -- are you sure?
Die?  What...?
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I heard your playing.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
I decided it this morning.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Continue.
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
We're by Ozone...
What the hell happened?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
And who are you?
Are you alright?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Zydowski.  It's about time.
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Yeah?
He said he was following up some lead.
Speak of the devil.
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No...
I've got a better idea...
A bank?
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Don't you guys ever knock?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
What about him?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
Could he handle a direct contact?
What have we missed?
How are Molly and the boy?
Not the Bible?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Why?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
The mark? Yes.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
I have work to do at the plant.
Who?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
I don't know...
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
You'll let me go now?
Dr. Chilton.
It's Will Graham...
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Do you know something about that?
I don't want to do that,
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
I call him a monster.
And you said?
Tell me about yourself.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
You haven't smoked in two years.
Can you quit?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
What's the problem, Molly?
What do you want?
Yes. Who are you?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
And Hobbs died?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
No.
What were the yards like?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
Fight what?
Why does it feel good?
Pretty well.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
I'm sorry, George...
How long would they let me sleep?
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
What was that all about?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Five.
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
You're NOT DYING!
I'm gonna quit.
What?!?
So?  What do they know?
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Do you?
There's something about him, isn't there?
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Is that...?
Do you always look at it encoded?
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Yes.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
The agents --
What are you doing?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
For what?
You -- you're too fast.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
Do you understand, Neo?
How?
The beginning?
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
How...?!
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
You're the Oracle?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Why?
What?
What does that mean?
No.
Zion?
What are they doing to him?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
It's locked.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No, all we got is $40.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
May God be with you.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Look at her.
So?
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Waddaya think?
What happened to you Flash?
Don't promise...just deliver.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Back so soon.
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Hey, shut up.
What's a'matter?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Wha?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
Sure...He lives there?
Count it.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
You could say that.
Friends of yours Michael.
How much?
Can you spare it?
You ate?
That's your name?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
-- But he does seem very nice.
That was 'Joe'.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
It's for the party, Dad --
Do they, m'dear?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
...See you tomorrow night.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Yes.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
No.
Perhaps you could remind me.
No, I don't --
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
It's going to be great --
I'm all excited --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Is there any more to it?
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
Mind if I throw up?
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
What are their feelings?
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
He said that?
Rass!
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Yes?
She's in a great deal of pain.
Has her pain abated?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
More than you love peanut butter?
I love you in an evening gown.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
We know so little about each other --
Will it?
That's it?
No.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Of course.
Are you sad, Bill?
Dinner?  Absolutely.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
Okay.  Goodnight.
'Fish'?
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
Yes?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
I think you heard me, Bill.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
He is --
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Not exactly.
I am not a dream.
Yes.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Get what?
Hi, Bill --
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Uh oh --
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
You're terrible.
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
Raise away.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Where's Joe?
I don't understand.
I love him.
You and 'Honey'?
What's the way?
Did I say something wrong?
Why not?
21.
38.
39.
78.
47.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
I'm sorry... um... ?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, I remember you.
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Yes.
Have I told you what this man did?				*
They treating you alright?
Did you?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Who?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Yeah, I hated it.
I told him about your car.
What's wrong?
Did you?
What?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
Well, that's me.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
It's good.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
You know it?
Yup?
Guess I've told you about my condition.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
So was he scared?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
What do you mean "bad news"?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
It makes all the difference.					 *
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
Yes you do...
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
25% discount on the load.
Make it 35.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
Cost less.  That's the point.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Where would I go?
If they attack you...
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
What's your take?
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Then you should.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
Where's Riccardo?
How'd they get onto you?
So?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You mean with the flowers...?
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
So lay it out, my brother...
Then what were we talking to you for?
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You ain't coming to work?
Yeah?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
For what?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Oh hell, forget it.
Forget it.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Where'd that come from?
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
You got a comb?
Don't need a comb.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
Sounds like they knew you.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
Gin's okay.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
You bet I do, sir.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
How's your hernia?
Who?
Dad...I'm...
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
What?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
His name?
Hey, you can't...
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Peter...
Yeah...?
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Which way?
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
Pretty rough so far.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Well, I hope you like it.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
The what?
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
You really think so?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
Oh, I like that tone.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
All done, chief..
I thought you were going to dinner.
Where is it?
Magic...
Your room.
Mmmm.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
'Thief in the Night?'
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
A change of plans?
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
And six billion in the world.
I'd like a little more conviction..
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Twice.
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
Excuse me?
Very.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Yes.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
She must still be on the property.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Luther, say again.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
To friends.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
I'm walking.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
The message is for Job.
I didn't say that.
Claire...Hey...
This stuff is so sticky.
This is Kittridge.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
<u>Are you intact</u>?
I donít think so.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
Who else is left?
The arms dealer.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What are we downloading?
What kind?
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Give me the God damn gum.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Tell you what?
I guess.
Can you lose him?
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
And get a doctor.
Why don't you take a look?
Jack you're so wicked.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Yes...  Itís him.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You're welcome.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
You did this once it didn't work out.
The guy died.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Maybe.
He did?
Here.
What are you doing here?
Why you looking around so much?
I don't know. I got a feeling.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Excuse me.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
Bus hit him.
Why what?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I'm telling you your life!
No!
Son of a bitch!
Get all of me. Take everything.
What?
What did you do?
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'll come to the wedding.
But he wants me to come!
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
Thank you!
What do you want to do now?
What's the matter?
I'm freezing to death.
Loretta?
What!
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Maybe you're right.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
You never have dessert.
What?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
Where's pop?
What? He's in Sicily!
He's with his dying mother!
What about the moon?
Oh.
I know.
I don't know.
Don't fight.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I came right from the airport.
So.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Then why are you eating alone?
May I walk with you a ways?
Yes.
That's my house.
My God, it's a mansion!
Is who down there?
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
You got me.
How do you know she is a witch?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Am I right?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
No one live there.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
What?
Too late.
Je...sus Christ!
Well you could say: "Dennis"
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Bloody peasant! 
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
... Well, we did do the nose.
The nose?
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
Blue.
Don't be such a baby.
When's your next round?
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
But, Mother ...
Herbert.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
No ... just keep him in here.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
What?
Oh ... hello ...
We must examine you.
You got my note!
Bravely ran away, away.
How about yourself?
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I see.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
Do you know who you address, sir?
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
And that is my last word on the matter.
By whose authority?
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Nobody has any rights over me.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
See what?
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Aye, ma'am.
What are those?
To keep out the cold.
John?
I came as quickly as I could.
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
The question is, do we need her?
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
What's her excuse this time?
Why not?
What is it?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
So how did it know my name, then?
It turned itself back on, Nick.
We can't...
Nick, what is it.
Virgin sacrifices?
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
You don't get it, do you?
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
Christ...no time...
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
And then keep on driving?
But I don't understand...
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
Adam, where are you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
Yes...what is it?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
So, what did they say?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Wow!
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
But it said #12.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
But, this could be serious.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Mulholland Drive?
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Yeah, they showed me
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
No...
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
What's going on ?
Why should we trust you ?
Leave him, he's dead.
I'm working on it.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
What are you doing ?
We drown.
Is this really the time ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Just stop it. End it here.
What are you DOING here ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Is it over ?
Not yet.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Well ?
Excuse me, sir ?
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
I was.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
What's next ?
Look he figured it out !
How can this happen ?
Do you want to go out with me ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Hi. I brought some wine.
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Umm, where do you want this?
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Don't mention it.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Okay, no problem.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Totally groovy huh?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Do you have any pictures if her?
More than anything in the world.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
That's okay.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
There's water in your bathroom.
You're over reacting!
He said it was a gift.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I think it's cool.
You would.
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
...I dropped it.
You mean,  this ring?
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
No?
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
But...are you engaged or something?
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I should do this myself.
I'm just tired.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
It would be fantastic.
Hey! Oh look.
Vada!!
Of what??
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
It's there.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Yeah.
Rock?
Do you want to?
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Dad?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
I like the freak show.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Maybe black means you're happy?
He won't give it to me.
Can we look around in your camper?
Big Ringo fan.
No, I'm divorced.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
What are you saving for?
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Uh huh.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Here.
Pacifist!
Bed wetter!
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
What?
Hi Vada.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
It is not.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
No.
You better not either.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Try less appropriate.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
He'll see right through it.
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Such as.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
You never eat when you're despondent.
Big weddings are so strange.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
You miss her, huh?
Michael? What ha...
What happened?
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Right here.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Then why are you listening to her -
Yes.
She's fine.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
He knows better.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
Whose word?
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Yes, but we're just singing.
Where are you going?
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Come on. He's a crook.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
Replacement party.
Have you seen a woman about so high?
What kind?
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
When did you start singing?
How long have you been with them?
No, I don't.
Do you like him?
Yes.
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
I don't know who you are.
Wrong.
Older.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
What?
What?
I can do benefits
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Where are you going?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Probably a little too long.
I'm Opal.
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
You go to school together?
You do?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Where are you from?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Naw, she don't mind.
Are we in a big hurry?
Mickey!
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Susanville, Soledade.
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Whose ratings were higher?
Not to anybody. She sings.
All right, Mickey.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Do you miss Mallory?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
That's indescribable.
No.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
And a snake-eye glare.
They've hypnotized the nation.
How immediate is immediately?
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
How so?
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
I can't do that. Five guys.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Give her a beer.
It sure is.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
They say your dad's 'round town.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Any other family?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Went to college, huh?
Yes, aren't you?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
That's right.
Let's go, Duff.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
How old is your boy?
Your boy.
Thank you.
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
I can see why.
What about him?
What's wrong?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Everything you cook is good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
Don't look so scared.
Don't deny me, Duff.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Good-bye, Frankie.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
What happened?
Great.
That's right.
Better get him to a hospital.
How often does he get like that?
Going back, huh?
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I guess not.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Oh yeah?
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I know.
Hi.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
What the hell is that?
Alright. Let's talk business.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
And then?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Prepping your trip.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Can you read my mind?
I don't have a girl.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Right...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Yo.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Where the hell have you been?
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
You're late.
Case... are you okay?
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
What's my end?
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
A regular Fagan.
You okay?
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Case...
Is he going to make it?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
I'm still going in.
Well, do you?
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Yes, it's lame.
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Anita!
Cuuuute!
Hidden camera.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Do I want to be crunched?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
But I don't want it straightened out.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Do you even know these kids?
What if I say no?
That's your story!
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
God, I can't do this.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Better person than I.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
This seat taken?
Are you--scared?
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Wow - I-
Where're we taking him?
Coming...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Come back here!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
You two got a thing going, or what?
It was okay.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
I'm sorry...
You mean a shithead.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
What is this place?
Jess?
Hi, guys.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
You did it the other night.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Just until we get things under control.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Doesn't matter.
Then maybe you're ready.
Take us there, Kristen.
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
We've got work to do.
A sad choice.
Mary Helena.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
This is stupid.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Really, no.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Hi.  Can I come in?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Yup.
Yes.  Always have had.
Okay.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
I thought I'd give it to you.
Sorry about that.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Bella -- this is Anna.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
What's your name?
Mr. Thacker?
Yes?
Ah... yes, enormously.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
That's not fair.
What did she say?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
What?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Which floor?
Yes.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
M-m-m-ma'am?
Yes, Billy?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Will you come with me, please.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Is there anything else?
Sorry to have bothered you.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Oh, I had them removed.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
H-H-Help!
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
What for?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
What for?
Lobotomy!
Giving up?
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
What's this?
Right!
My turn.
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
Oh, what was that?
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
I don't, Doc...
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Big man!
There they are!
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Oh, yeah...
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
No.
You're sure...
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
Your great aunt.
Amazing.
Who's this?
Why can't you just tell me?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Do you want me to do it?
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Yeah.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
Very funny.
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Just since yesterday.
Yes?
Oh, hello.
You don't have any idea?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
Does Dwayne know about this?
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
A phone message.  Only--
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
What if he doesn't like me?
And he is living proof.
And you are?...
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Well, where are they?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
I want to be a teacher.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Pigeons... .
Edie... Edie... ..
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
Get away from me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Jimmy...
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
About Edie?
Mind your own business, Father.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
You can!
You all right, Nolan?
What do you think?
I'm just resting my feet.
Really?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
You was a Golden Warrior.
Hit me again.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Forty-five bills.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Listen, Johnny—
You want to know somethin'—?
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Look!
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Ahh, she will be yours.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Oh, if there is only time!
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
No. No! No!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aannnnaahhnn.
Glenn Michaels.
Yes, it is.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Adele?  You in there?
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Nice disguise.
You at least bring the gun?
Outside of that.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
Yes, she did.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
They look like plain old rocks.
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Daniel.  Listen --
All right, but...
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
You know who this is?
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
How do we do that?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
What were you gonna do with me?
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You know I saw you on the street.
Why are you mad?
You're not dumb.
You getting serious on me now?
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
Take your sunglasses off.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
You goin' right back to work?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
You gonna write me a check?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
The flight?
You busted out?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
What's wrong with you?
I'm looking for Maurice.
You like to sit down?
No.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Was it Foley?
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
He waved to you?
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
You gonna go get him?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Ten gees.
You liked that?
Sir, I --
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Sorry.
Well...sure.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
What do you get for winning?
Oh, this is Betty.
We're all going away.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
I can't. It's all too much.
We're going to take you home.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
How'd you know about that?
Just take a look at it. 
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
You think so?
At my age? Don't be silly.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
The hat business is in trouble.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
I remember that dress.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
Dancing with you.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
What a great kite.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
What's inside?
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
What're you doing?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
What are you doing?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
I came to say goodbye.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
Who was that?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
He pissed me off.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Aren't you giving an exam?
Drew!
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
Fuck you.
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Continue.
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
I'm a law suit.
Correct.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I've considered that.
I still am.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Absolutely.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Mom?
Were you recently promoted?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
Uh.... No. Not really.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
We won.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Good school. What year?
How many do you know?
Who?
Yeah... ?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
He was doing a great job.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Don't wanna miss this.
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Tell me that was you.
Power cells.
Entered our minds.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
We can, can't we? Trust you?
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Just come with me!
You'd die for them?
What, switch what?
Hey, who?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Like what?
Little ratty-ass.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
For your own fear.
79 kilos.
This does not help us, Johns.
Just shut up, okay?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
You know who Muhammad was?
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Suleiman!
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
I'd rather piss glass.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
So which one caught your eye?
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
I apologize.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Remembers what?
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
The evidence was very meager --
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Yo!
Which direction?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Hmph.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Huh?
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
If only we could get a fix.
All right --
Climb off me, will you!
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Scarecrows?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
What is that?
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Mind your tongue, madame.
What about it?
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
First time?
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
Must be somebody?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
I didn't like it.
Vancouver, B.C.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Would you mind?
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
Dance? Here?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
No percentage in that.
They're going to arrest me.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
Killaine...
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
You-killed-him?
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Please answer my question.
What this?
Where's you get it?
FLorida?
You understand perfectly.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I expected nothing else.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Very ridiculous.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
But even if you were in love with me.
All right. Get him.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
You asked for it.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
What?
Where?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
How are you two getting along?
Would that make me a heel?
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Not too hard, is it?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
Do I know who lives down there?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
Pretty big chance, huh?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
What about me?
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
And if you didn't believe me?
I'm interested in who handled it.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
Who's the girl?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Be nasty.
What a shame.
Yes.
It's fine, thank you.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
I'm not sure I can face it.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
I have to be up early. 
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
Did she talk about me?
You approve!
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Thanks.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Dad.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.
Ah, Susy, it...
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
You gonna pull?
You're a fucking dead man--
What?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Good move.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Got it.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
You had enough?
What?
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
What have you got in mind, General.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
You don't know anything about me.
Storage, I think.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
I... I would take advantage of it.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
You looking' for some company?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
I never joke about money.
Three hundred.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Uh-huh.
And why do you say that?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
It's a very good year.
Did you sleep well?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Of course.  How much?
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Any good?
Hello?
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Was someone rude to you?
Okay.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
Real genuine guy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Do I look okay?
What's that?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
But don't they have it in English?
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
Yes...
Why?
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Who did you think?
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Dummy.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Yeah, what?
Kit give me nothin'.
What's your name?
But I always eat like this.
They will serve salad.
Me?
You're not accompanying him to New York?
What is with you?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
I killed him myself.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
I only dog paddle.
Probably he means no harm.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
How many could you handle?
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
-- where?
Will this do?
What is it?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Rise and report.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Shall we track them both?
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
I thought he was with you.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
We're really in a terrible rush.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
You are ready, then?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
Kill me quickly.
You've made your decision then7
Don't say another word, Valerie.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Congratulations.
"Honeymoon,
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Oooooooops!
Do the books!  Do the books!
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
What???
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
You, Blum go Motel.
Finder's keepers.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Of Siegfried...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
What did you tell the people?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
What?
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Back where?
What do you mean?
Not at all!
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Yes.
Here?
What should I know?
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
What thing could we be in together?
Is Mary... in trouble?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Does that mean we can't...
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
This is the old highway.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Sorry.
You can't go up there.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
For what?
I have to go, Sam.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
You have something most girls never have.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
A man should have a hobby.
You go out... with friends?
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
Why do you ask that?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
You should... mind it.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
You slept here all night?
May I see your license?
Why?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Barefaced.
I don't know what you've been saying.
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Leave me alone!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
You here again?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What is it now?
Did you hear?
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
That's what I said.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Fine, thanks.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Heaven knows. A lot.
What is it? What happened?
Have you got it? Is it completed?
What was her name?
Where to?
We flopped the first time out.
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Dysfunctional --
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Yes?
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What is it, Rose?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Am I hurting you?
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
All right, what do you know?
Open that door, damn you!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
So am I.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
I am ahead of you.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Is she all right?
No reason at all, darlin'.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
You're so sweet.
Is this ill right?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Well, it's Billy.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Well. What kinda job is it?
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Yes, dear, what is it?
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Yes, go on.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I was going to tell him.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
You think it's that good?
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
Yeah.
What's the plan?
What?
What about him?
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
That's him alright.
Where we going?
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
You could start over again with cash like that.
You going rogue on me?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Can't be worse than you.
Let's get this thing done.
How'd we do?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
We're screwed.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Why the beach?
The gang's all here!
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
There's still good in him.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Fine. Together again, huh?
The same as always.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
I thought she was with you.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Good luck.
What did he say?
All wings report in.
Over there! Two more of them!
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
I know, father.
Come with me.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Uh huh.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Weiss.
Brad...
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
"Transylvania"
Free to try and find a game
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
I just dislocated my finger.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Yes.
...What?
Don't want weak legs.
...And he called the reporters --
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
That so.
It's not your house --
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Owe you what?
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
He got lucky.
My side.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Cost ya a buck.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
No -- Just me.
Did you hear what I said?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
How old are ya?
How old?
Yeah, Kayo.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
'Bout an hour ago.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
What's happened is freak luck.
It ain't your locker no more.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
What kinda business?
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
It don't matter.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
You ballin' her?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Well, I'll be...
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
So where is it then?
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Maroon, right?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
Surprised?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
So altruistic.
What the hell is that?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
When will I hear from you?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
I think you oughta read it to her.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Juliet!
I come for my lady Juliet.
Goodnight.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
I have.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Nurse.
Of course.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Hazard pay...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
It's quite satifactory.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
Here's yours.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Whoever hired us.
I swear...
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Then I guess we're set.
Nobody's going to do that!
Of course.  Don't you?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
I borrowed that, too...
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
How could you have done that?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
What the hell happened here?
Ready to roll, partner?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
What are you gonna do?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Okay then.  I'll do it.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
I don't know...
It's the right thing to do.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
That's not what I mean.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
You said that last time!
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
It's gonna be o.k.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
Dwayne's dead.
It's NOT too late!
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
Why don't you get to the point.
Well, I don't know...
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Two thousand...
What's that?
Has he?
Hi.
Hi.
Nothing.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
A satellite dish?
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
I don't believe it.
Sally, do you love me?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Yeah.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
I guess we can get started.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Uh, no...
Don't you have to be here?
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
A lot of men come in here?
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
She's not his type.
About what?
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Whatever...
We're out of here.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
At least around here it does.
Are you hungry?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Is this about the funny money?
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
I knew you were lying.
What'd I say?
Hello.
Well, hurry up.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
You sound like that all the time.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
Is it hot in here?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
What?
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
Get it out of here!
I wouldn't do that!!!
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
End of the line.
What?!?!
I could use a little vacation.
Put your arms around me.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Who the hell is that?
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Shut up!
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
You talk very fast.
What about them?
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
What?
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
You want more?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
I am from outa town.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Hello.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Han?
It's Griffin.
Yes.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
And in a "V".
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
I don't think that's why she ran.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Getting nervous?
You're going to be very disappointed.
That's fair.
Twice...
Five hundred.
I'm a work in progress.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
You humiliated me!
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
It's probably because you got him fired.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Grandma!
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
You couldn't.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
It's not true, but it feels true.
Actually, he sounded nice.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
I know.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's probably just the flowers --
Are his folks nice?
How amazing.
Magic.  It was magic.
Mom!
It's you.
Which means --
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
All righ...
Why not?
I don't know --
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
When's the latest time you were out there?
You'll find out.
Dad, could you close the door?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
I don't get it.
No, I'm not, but --
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
English muffin.  How do you do it?
Will she scratch up your back?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
How's Jonah taking it?
Hi.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
You're welcome to one.
Well?
How goes it?
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Are you sick, Mama?
Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Can be what?
How do you feel?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
A meeting?
I waited up till midnight.
Hunting.
Alone?
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
The what!
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
First rate, ain't it?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
How?
This man sounds like a real catch.
You don't understand.
It gets me through the day.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
I'm kind of busy.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
What's wrong, Danny?
Colette, go.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Nice day
He doesn't have one.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
If you say so.
No last name?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
When?
What're your taking down?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Bullshit. He's a liar.
That's because he doesn't have one.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Danny?
Please ... don't do this ...
This the guy?
Yeah.  What about him?
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
He's the only one I told.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
And you've got wiener breath.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Resistance?
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
That must be four thousand yards.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
Some.
Over three-hundred.
Good luck, Captain.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
PUSH!
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
You alright?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
I think you're right, Keith.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
What are we going to do?
Sure, Reiben.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Up.  We're moving out.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Thank you, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Who cares?
Damn fool.  Sir.
No, no he's not.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Keep it.
Hey, sis.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
What's a scam?
Please?
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Oh yeah!
They really applauded you today honey.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I just had a phone call.
Dad.
Did he ever get rough with you?
Bon voyage.
What happened to you?
No, but you stole from them.
I made their lives better.
Thank you very much.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Well...
Would you hold this for me?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Job?  Being a great date.
No, I'm serious.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Oh.
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Be friends?
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Okay, this is important...
Am I wrecking my car?
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Your letter came yesterday.
It was wonderful.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Yeah.
YEAH!
Uh... okay... um...
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
How do you pay for one of those?
Seriously, Lloyd.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
She's very successful.
Very talented.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Lloyd.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Ooop, excuse me.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Now you're back.
Sir, the list is correct.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Yeah, what's that?
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
You want these people.
What's that?
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
Of course I'm on it.
Like this?
Good.  How's it going?
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
I was just the accountant.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
That's very generous of you.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
thought he was doing AA.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Hello? Ted?
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
Can we talk?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
Home--where he lives.
I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
But you’ll never get away with it.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
What's your subject?
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
She dumped me.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
He hates Oliver Stone.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
I know that.
This is all too familiar.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Jesus Christ!
Yeah, right.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Sid, I'll come with you.
Yes, goddammit!
What about rehearsal?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Her old boyfriend?
And white.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Take it off.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
What was that?
Do you work for her now?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
What?!
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Always.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Jennifer needs me.
Stop following me.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Your life?
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
I am Gale Weathers!
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Need to get in that building?
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Gale he's got Dewey!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
You're not happy with your part.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
I'm hanging up right now.
Roman that's not the line.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Who the fuck is this?
You ready to party hard tonight?
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
Ready?
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
I thought she was dead.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
Oh it did?
You know what my dad will do to you?
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Or even a good porno.
Who did you call?
I don't think so.
Why do you want to know my name?
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't hang up on me.
Yes?
To talk.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
No...
What?
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
You never know when or where a story will break.
So is Dewey your real name?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
She staying with you?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Where is she?
What? What?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Why would she lie about it?
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
I have no idea.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
...out at the airport...
Stu was with me last night.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
The why'd the police let him go?
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
Wanna another beer?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
No way.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
Give it to me.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
What the fuck is going on?
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
I... I don't follow.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
You just met me.
I realize that.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
There must be something.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Oh, that's all.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
How is this legal?
How do you know all about this?
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
I'm fine.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Perfect example.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Did their son see it happen?
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
You all right, sergeant?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
I say NO!
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Well, the reward still stands...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
How'd you come by this?
Talk!
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
You all right, Ethan?
Say it. We're beat!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Because she's my...my...
He just couldn't wait...
But I just bought a good blanket.
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Why didn't he make his move back there?
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
They'll be back...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
You crazy?
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
It still worked in town.
Hey... the fuse.
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
We just have to make a new beginning.
I miss Tommi so much.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Where have you been all day?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Where have you been?
What?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
Ellen.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Will…Where is Mercutio?
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
And your relations?
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
It's a comedy.
And his ears.
Partners!
Of course not!
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Romeo.
Another little problem.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
Be good to her, my lord!
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
What do you love so much?
And--?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Who is there?
Moonlight!
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, Will!
That's my line!
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
My lady Viola.
I have spoken with your father.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Good morning, my lord!
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
And break her heart and mine?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
A theatre poet?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
What's his name?
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Serve.
I'm only asking what you think.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
No.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
So I gathered.
Are you recording it?
That's all?
Right.
Well, she had problems --
Have you seen Hugo?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Yes.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Sshh.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Forget it.
You'll wait in the hall?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Who said there were four?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
It wasn't like that.
Sorry?
Right here?
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
Yes, sir.
That one, last week.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
No.
Shall I answer it?
And he's a patient of yours?
You know about it?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Yes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Sorry?
Offering it for debate.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
My keys.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
She's got a...
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
You going to answer it?
Want me to?
Like what?
I guess so.
Well, are you?
... just, you could look very heavy...
I never get my hair done.
And you need money?
How long you had this?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
You going to tell him?
Whew.
And what?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
Did you?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
George...
-- what?
That sounds like me.
He still having parties?
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
God, there's Lester...
What for?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
That's too bad.
I have to see you.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Who?
You're different.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Yeah, baby...
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Okay.
About what?
When is that?
I'll call you.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Never mind. Where've you been?
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
How come you took your own car?
You did fuck him, didn't you?
What difference does it make?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Baby, don't do this --
What're you here for?
You need a cut.
It's an unusual trade.
When?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
I know it, I know it.
All night.
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
I mean, how did that happen?
Yes I do.
No.
I'll call you back.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Well maybe I can get you something.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Jackie, what're you doing?
I know, I'm sorry.
Five times a day?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
How much?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I would say so, yes.
What did you do?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Johnny!
-- no.
I don't think so.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Jill.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Do you have something against traveling?
Call me Les.
I'm hungry.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
Yes, Dad.
What?
Who's Tony?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yes.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
All right.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Yes, sir.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
No, we don't mind.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Yes.
Did you find anything?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Stop it!
I'm gonna go now.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well...
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Right there.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
What if I say no?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
And you listen to that?
What you do?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
You bastard!
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Like this place?
Shirelles.
Amateurs 2
Van Cartier.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
I... I brought you something.
She won't?  Why not?
Experience!  Right?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
I see.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Your cell is more than adequate.
So... hi there.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Out of the question.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
It's done?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
But, Bishop...
If we could speak alone.
Who took the meat?
Bring Young Masbath here.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
Chosen me?
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.
No, I couldn't...
Should we go back?
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
All I saw was their lantern.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
How are you?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
There is no such thing as magic.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Why would you do such a thing?
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
What?
Blood.
What... what are you doing... ?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
Katrina...
What was that?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Go home.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Thank ye.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Don't tell me what to do.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
Sure, I guess.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
You got that shit right.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Childers.
I want to be baptized.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
Are you well?
They still around, your folks?
Who did you kill?
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Naw.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
Yeah.
Why?
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
Is that right?
You will? For sure?
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
I know he does.
Mama?
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Yes sir.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Do they know about you?
I'll be.
Right now?
Thank ye.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Do you have family here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I reckon not.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
What about me?
Do you smell shit?
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Where will he go?
Why?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Will that be cash or charge?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
I'd love to.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Huh?
The Queen of England?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
Two, right?
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
What do you mean?
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
What's this?
Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?
For keeps?
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
The refrigerator?
You mean Rashid?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Jesus.
You going to sit here all day?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
In Manhattan?
Here and there. Around.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I didn't expect to see you again.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
Yeah, I can believe it.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Drawing's a good thing.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No way.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Yeah, it might be.
No wonder he was angry.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
How do you want that cooked?
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Closer to eight.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
You're implying th...
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
Yes.  Initially.
I have told the truth.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Cigarette?
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
Does it now?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
I don't think so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
He had no reason to.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Yes.  And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
You're welcome.
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
What happened?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
You're right, Joe.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
But suppose it doesn't?
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
I told you - it's a sure thing.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
Right.  We have the same blood type...
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
You've flipped your wig!
Where are we running, Joe?
As far away as possible.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
Men?
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Blow where?
How can we?  We're broke.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
All right - so what do we do now?
What'll I tell him?
Good night, Sugar.
Interesting.
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
What do you think you're doing?
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Josephine -
Well, I'll come back later.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
No!
What for?
Where did you girls play before?
We could pass for that.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
Daphne...
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
I don't like no witnesses.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Where did he conduct?
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
You can't trust those guys.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
Men!
Would you mind terribly?
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
My fault.
Why?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Your face is familiar.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Your view of what?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
You're society girls?
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Yeah.  Real hot.
Would you mind moving along, please?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
It's all right for a bachelor.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Complete washout.
Oh, no!
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Is it that hopeless?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Tomorrow night?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
Refresh my memory.
Thanks, Charlie.
What for?
You don't owe me no nothing.
I should get going.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
It was such a long time ago.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What’s his problem?
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing.
Hey, you!
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
I’m sorry?
Hi. Hey.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Oh, cut the crap!
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
What’s he do anyway?
You want me to let him in?
“Not yet...”
I always wondered what happened with us.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
And you say all them people is dead now?
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
What about Sounder?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
You could? How?
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
David Lee...
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
You bet we is!
Goodnight, Daddy...
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
You know somethin', Daddy?
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
That's right!
Ready to go, Mama!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
Who's Miss Johnson?
It's the heat.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
I wanta get some things.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Is there something I can do to help you?
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Will they give him a trial?
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Doggy.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
About what?
What?
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
I can't believe he's dead.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
YOU DO?!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Help yourself prickfuck!
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
The N word?
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Yes I am!
Mrph?
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
SHIT!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Be careful, dude.
It's okay, I am done for.
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Yes?
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
The F word?!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Who's my cream puff?
Don't call me dumb!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Cool!
What is it?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Excuse me?
Magnificent, magnificent.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Were you going to give it to them?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
Really?
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
I don't know what we're facing.
What's that?
What is happening around here!!!
I'm going back for Taylor!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
You're not from around here, are you?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I'm getting to like it here.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
Son?
I don't like to talk about it.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
Get that outta your mouth!
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Won't your father help you with that?
I'd rather you didn't.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Do I want you?
Do you talk with your mom?
I could let them go for ten.
Nothing.
You got any broken bones?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
We would have sooner or later.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
I'm not here to bowl.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Hold on --
They told me about sixty hours.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Thirty yards.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Thank you, Colonel.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
How drastic?
She should've known better.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
I see it.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
She wired this system.
They switched us over.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
I love secrets.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
You bastard.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
You don't trust me?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
You get it straightened out?
The refridgerator.
You think?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Three to six hours.
You ever given an injection before.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
You think I'd really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
How do you feel about snakes?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Yes.
C'mon --
For who?  The fish?
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Why are you looking at me like that?
You're staring at me.
Where's it coming from?
You holding up alright?
This answers one of our questions.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
What is that?  That noise?
Beth left?
How do we decode it?
The three of us.
Push her, c'mon.
What does Norman already know?
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Please.  It must have flown here --
The others, sir?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
No, they didn't say --
Who's everyone?
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
How can you store an energy field within you?
That's where my father was killed.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
I'll make a report later.
Here come six more... grid two!
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
This isn't going to work.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
What an honor...
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Johnny, this is Zander.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
A funeral.
Good for you.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Why not ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Are you the boy for me ?
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Shhhh...!
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
What ?
Oh, my, what's that ?
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
What do you think you're doing ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Yes, sir !
Sergeant, secure the boat !
<U>Why</U>?!
<U>Answer</U>!
Yes.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Forward motion, Captain...!
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
And whatever you sensed out here....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Why did you quit?
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
You like my play.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
But, but but but...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
No, I don't...
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Hi.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
You can do it.
I can't get it to come out right.
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Is it...
Good morning.
Yes...
Now you're talking...
Not without a rolltop desk.
What is it all about?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
We did...?
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
I wasn't doing business.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Well, then, what's he doing here?
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
I will.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
Fourteen year old girls.
It's Marty on the Coast -
How big is this horse?
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
That's right.
Sure, what have you got?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
She's a...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
I'm very sorry to...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
Who is that...?
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yeah.
Yes, yes, but...
...I...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
I know...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Doug, the traffic light...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Doug...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I can't find the writer.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I know the feeling.
I want to make a good film.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I'm gonna nail it.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
I didn't say anything to them.
Mmm.
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
Not with my mouth open.
Mom?  What's wrong?
I'll miss you so much.
Hold lunch!
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Before you.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Something's up wi...
We're not discussing your age.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Me too.
It's temporary.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
What did you do?
Look, I...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
However many.  It's not enough.
Not personally.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
See, I know that.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
My advice to you?  Don't die.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
It was a veal stock, I thi...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Well, they will be.
I needed some time away.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
What?
It was God's will.
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
My Jesus…
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
I know!
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
We're not ready!
Twinkeys!
What's tomorrow?
Oh. What happens now?
What do you want?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
Scooby?
Yeah?
Dad?…Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Thanks.
Gee, you're home early!
That's good.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
I hate reading.
Great!
But...you called.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
That's good.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Is he with the girl?
We don't have time!
Let's move it we got company!
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Who's Ryan Cooper?
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
I have your word, Mister President?
Where are you trying to reach him?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
What?
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Didn't they tell you?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
You aren't sure!
Yes?
Do you recognize my voice?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
That's right, sir.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I don't think so, sir.
I'm trying to, sir.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Why can't you cancel it?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
Yes?
Call them every five miles.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Check target approach.
Primary circuit is live.
Release first safety.
Yes, Major.
He's dead.
He's dead, all right.
What do you mean?
You tell me.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
I'm okay.  What's up?
Let me check.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Slides go with it.
Typical male.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Oh.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
It's your birthday?
Yeah.
That's the rock star thing.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Okay, okay.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Y- s-sure it did.
What?
Yes! Free concert!
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
I can come visit?
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Are you talking to me?
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Whoa!
You make videos?
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
It's a mistake to think that.
I know. It's okay.
Taking care of business.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Who were you talking to?
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
No.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Look, why do you care, huh?
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
It's a piece.
About things that are important to me.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
This is ridiculous!
Oh, yeah?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
My goal is to make art.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Wait, away?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
So how's college?
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You do not!
You do not want me to do your cover.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
About what?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Whatever.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
No car.
You know the fuck not.
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Positive.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
Let me explain something...
Shut up.
Oh no...
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Is that you down there?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Your help.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
As for instance?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Into what? A lampshade?
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Oh, you --
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Nice job.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
It must be my new shampoo.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
This is where you live?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Come on, Joe.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Yes, I did.
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
It is not.  Get out.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Yeah?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Of course it is.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Just a scene I cut out.
They've come for my car.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
The other guests?
What are the notes?
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
Why do you say that?
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
This room has not been used for a long time.
How come?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Haven't got a thing.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Paramount studios.
This is the staircase of the palace.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Why did she have to show up now?
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
Home?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Why not ?
What's that?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Miss what?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
What?
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Nurse! Nurse!
No!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
I've got things to do.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
How do you know?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Where is Earth?
But what for?
What can I do for you?
No, MR. Danvers.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Tuesday.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
It sure is.
You...um...you never got married?
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
Call me.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Do you really know Superman?
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Kitchen. . . Technician
What about this week's check?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Columbia.
First question got to be "Where."
Hey, boss.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
What will it do?
Anything.
We back in Metropolis?
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
But the other night...
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
85,000 dollars.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Let's go to my place.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Uh...home...
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
What else is ballast for?
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Mush!  Mush!
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
To ski?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
		DELETE IN CUTTING
General --- ?
I've never been in a place like this before.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
What's that?
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
This wasn't in the plan.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
You think he'll find us.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Thank you.
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
No.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Not unless you can fly.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Oh.
You and your real estate.
You think he's for real?
Bet he makes it.
What's the temperature now?
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
Meteorites!
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
You're happy, aren't you?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
A night on the town instead of under it?
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
I guess I got carried away
Twenty-four.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
Luthor  --
And what does he do again?
I...don't think so.
What happened?
Alison.
Case?
Why are you telling me this?
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
A while.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Yes.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Berry-picking.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
I did.
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
Dolores.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
She...she was a friend of mine.
What do you mean?
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
You can't come here.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
No.
How does the family survive?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
You remember this?
What do you remember about the accident?
What's that?
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
Yes.
I don't know.
Will you mind your own business!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
See my mother?
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Sidney is a liar!
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Match me, Sidney...
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
How?
He means that much to you...?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
You're incapable of the truth...
I don't think so.
What would you think of me if -
That's the third time he's called today.
He wants me to break a leg?
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
You ought to be used to me by now.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
You're talking very fast.
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
Yes, but why?
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Why did you call me?
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
What?
Smile?
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
This is tactically dangerous.
Remember what I said, you can't...
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
They took him from me.
You look like handmade shit.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
Respect your elders and your betters!
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Where you from, David?
I guess it's possible.
So, what does the Russki want?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Your manner.
Yes.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
No. Ours was damaged.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
I don't understand what you mean.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Do you know what's in this archive?
Show me.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
And ask him about his private life.
Sure.
They said I was dogged?
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Yes, Chuck?
Aren't I worth waiting for?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Anything else?
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Good field-dressing.
Kyle?
My whole life has been combat.
I want it to be over for you.
Don't say that.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
I know.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Admittedly...
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
It was an accident.
A game?
See you around.
Don't even think about it.
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Can we talk?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
Who is it?
What do you think you're doing?
Who's responsible?!
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
We searched the house.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
I saw them kill him!
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I didn't know what else to call you.
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Hey there, Nickie.
About me?
Really?
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Tell me where we're going.
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
It was a different floor then...
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Hm?
Dinner's in the oven.
You did?  How is he?
What makes you ask?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
No.
What gentleman, Maria?
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
I wasn't expecting you.
You know you can.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Sure.
Why?
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Nell --
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
Maybe they're Mary's.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Is there something about the house?
She was unhappy.
What did it cost?
Yes.  I've missed it.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Well?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I don't think I want any.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
As soon as you get dressed.
We think?
Hey.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
Been to the Boat Show.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Did Jenny know?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
What?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Same.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Had a feeling it was you.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Why did you come here?
Ashamed.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
That's what was estimated.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
I'll bloody well ask him.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
He alive to see this?
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Yeah?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
So what.
How'd you get in here.
Hello, Ed.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Boy.
You're an enthusiast.
Birdy--
Ah yes, a music lover.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
That right.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
All right.
How ya doin', Ed?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Uh-huh.
...You know... who *who* is?
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Just coffee.
Where you going?
Who?
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
Uh-huh.
Could you come with me please?
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
I'll go down and speak to him.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
We need light in here, stat.
You're kidding.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
I think I should come with you.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What's that?
What does it say?
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
What's going on?
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
We will.
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
We're not supposed to go back there.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Margo, you haven't heard?
And John?
Gone.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
The planetarium!
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
One.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
Certainly a nomination.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
That's correct.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
What's the hurry?
Let's go now.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
How are you, Mother?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I don't understand.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
What do you do?
What am I doing here?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Special Agent Scully --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
What is it you find incredible?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
I know the name. Why?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
Not according to the men in blue.
What?
What do you think?
I'm on the roof.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Jesus, Mulder...
...thirteen fifty six...
Something's not right...
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
What are you implying, Scully?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Why are you whispering?
Evidence of a massive infection.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
All the equipment is brand new.
What?
You hear that?
What are you doing?
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
We're going to the morgue.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have his number.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
I have answers for you.
Why are you telling me this?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
My god...
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Don't bring it home in this.
Sing a song of sixpence.
What's wrong?
Agent Novak?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Where the hell are we?
That went well.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
Thank you.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Already there.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
Here he is.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Yes.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's go away.
What are you going to do?
Wer ist da?
Harry.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
I don't know.
Must you take those?
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Yes.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Can you tell me whose...
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
See much of him before that?
I can't say that I have.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
What?
Listen, Callaghan.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Well?...
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
They wouldn't know me.
I know a very good dentist.
Very popular, sir.
Did the police believe you?
You told them, didn't you?
...this way.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Dr. Winkel?
Coming to the point, please.
In great pain?
Speak English?
You remember me? Upstairs...
You saw it?
Could he have been conscious?
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
What else did he tell you?
Mr. Martins...
Why?
Everyone ok?
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
One kilometer
So from there to there?
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
No one follows that midrash.
Watch your language....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Fucking Danny, man...
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
What do you care?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
Why?
That's stupid.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
No difference.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
You shouldn't.
I told you, I'm good at this.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
What'd you say?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
He has Israel.
What were you, following me?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
A forty-five.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
From the Rhineland originally.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Hello...?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Not too fast.
Why? Why would she?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Do you think I...
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Oh, fuck you...
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
It can't be true!
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
He seems to have won it.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
What else is there?
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
How do you know that?
Don't.
Lira?
Then tell him to wax it too.
Yes?
Where did you get that?
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Why?
You don't have that one, do you?
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Don't you have a heater?
Tea... or whiskey?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
I'm going back home.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
... Not at all.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
What?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
What?
How was your trip?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Way past it.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Will he understand Spanish?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
What was that!?
Mordechai?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Esther!
So don't show a picture.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What should I charge?
So, how was I?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Good looking?
What about me?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Who?
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Why?
Come to look around?
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Then you found the leopard --
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
That was unfortunate.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
What are you getting at?
Yes. The lipstick.
That's easy. Me.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Who was the other man?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
What! You can't be --
That’s right.
That might depend on where you’re going.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
Laurence!
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Are we understood?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
When did you get back?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
You don’t say.
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I don’t.
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Simplify and damn.
To get me killed...?
By your Austrian?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
What about an untrained pup, white...
On the bed!
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Carlos De Moraes?
Recommended?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
My rates...
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Clients come and go.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Is this Friedman?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
Have you?
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
I... How long have I been here?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Excuse me?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
What do you think, huh?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
They lost their son. Why?
Are they still operative?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Very generous of you all.  How much?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Now?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
We must sound the retreat!
Do as I say!
I am ready now...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Yes, probably... maybe...
And when was that?
Arrest them!
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
God defeated the English, not me.
What about you?
But where are you going to be?
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
The voice was in your cell?
And may I go to Mass?
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
You did well...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Well...?  Shall we go?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Who... who are you...?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
What do you mean, they won't come?
So your memory's coming back?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
I don't think so.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes, my lord.
I need to confess.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
My father's.
He never says his name.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
How are you doing?
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
When's your baby due?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
What?
Henryk's in there.
Can you help?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
That makes a change.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
In the attic.
There is something to be said for silence
Baines is packing up?
The Alps.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
You'd have to organise it up here.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
It's my mother's piano.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
That's right.
Yeh, go ahead.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
They're still looking for him.
You sober?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
Then you'll do it?
You just worry about your end, kid.
Everything go all right?
How 'bout Lonnegan?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
You think he'll show?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
Yeh.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
I'm not sure I know it.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
I'll square it with the fixer.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Where you goin'?
What time you get off work here?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You move right along, don't ya.
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
Well, what did I tell ya?
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
What happened?
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
You weren't hired to miss him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Nothing.
Well!
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Then what are you hiding?
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
How did you ever remember me?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
There. 
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Where did you hit her?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
A new invention?
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I'm asking you.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Get anything?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
That's ridiculous.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
Where were you?
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
What did you do with the rest?
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
But what if you need more money?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
No word at all?
It might.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
Hello, baby.
Who is she?
How many drinks have you had?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
That's jolly.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
He's just been for a walk.
You dog!
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
He was down in the shop.
I'm going to tell her.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Mimi!
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I hope you're well.
No, Mr. Charles.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Trying to put it off on her?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Who fired you?
Where were you going?
Baghdad.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
There's nothing we can do.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Where'd they go?
Missile!
What am I supposed to do?
Get off him.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You're out of your mind.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
Take the binoculars.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
It's a mine, isn't it?
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It's a fire fight.
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
They're going to kill us!
Think there might be more Iraqis?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Why do I have to stay down here?
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
Wes might be right about that.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
First Wes, now you?
And you; you've got it all together.
Yeah.
No!
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Can't you--
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Which way do we go!?
When did you make the switch?
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Now you need me.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Oh, Jesus!
triple three, triple three! easy.....
4732...?
I'm not hungry.
Now?
I haven't done anything.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
I was lost.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
You don't know that!
Officer Reilly, vice.
What're you talking about?
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
This is where the van was parked.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Which one's which?
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
It's from an IRA.
"Punks", huh?
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Glass, what is it?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
He is!
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
You okay?
Reilly, Vice. I-
Goddamit, Reilly--
Sir...
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
No!
He's really not a bad fellow.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
You say I am a crook.
Monescu.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Please.
Monescu!
What?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Yes.
Yes.
I remember.
Not particularly.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then I mislay my checkbook--
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Then a little nap--
Marvelous.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
Giron...!
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
The ship will sink.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
We're too late.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
You told me to change.
An accident?!
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Sure. Count me in.
Almost as good as you.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
I'm Jack Dawson.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
So don't marry him.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
May I cut in, miss?
Fabrizio said you might be up --
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
It's getting quiet.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I'm sorry.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
I can explain--
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Baloney!
Feeling a little better, I see.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
How about a little game later?
Could I see you a minute?
No gentleman would do that.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
I thought you were one of my friends.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Good-by.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
A little.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can live that down, can't you?
Nix, the law!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Thank you, sir. 
It's your deal.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
How about you?
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Here's your fifty.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Hello, Denby!
Oh, there you are--
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Well, he has a straw hat--
What happened to you?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
I wish I could.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
Why?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
He's certainly good-natured.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
God damn son of a...
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Where'd you get that horse?
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
That's just my game.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
Better.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Very instructive
He's drunk.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
Then what do I do?
Not half as bad as I feel.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Where do you get these questions?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
What's wrong?
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Florentino!  He's getting away!
It's that woman from the coach!
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'm sorry.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Do you feel better now?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
His newspapers?
Political considerations?
Gone fishing.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
I see...
Something with an engine? Not oars?
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
She married a hockey player.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Who knows? Fog, night...
Interesting presentation.
They point, I shoot.
... Does this do anything?
Bourbon. Neat.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
- Shut up!
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
If I were you -
What?
Blood or Dutch?
This has got to be a mistake.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Who's in charge here?
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Damn. It's doing it again.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
How sweet.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
It was nip and tuck.
What is that?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
I'm worn out.
Since this morning.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
Hattie is a different person now.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
When did you talk to Harry?
He is in his pigeon cage.
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
But Mom, I can't find him!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
What happened to you?
What?!
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Woody!  The rocket!
Ha-ha!!
Miss.  G-6.
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
What?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Last present!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Home is where the heart is.
Go away.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
We're too young.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
What is he planning on telling them?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
I was just waiting for the right time.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
This is different.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Caroline --
Did you tell Dad?
Hi.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Depends who it's from.
I'll put this in the back.
David --
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
They're going to walk right past me.
So go shower already.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
If I can.
Does this offer include my partner?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
My work keeps me young.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Who are these guys?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
What's your name?
Where's that?
What?
Ssshh!
So why have you told me about it?
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
What? Steady like?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What happened?
Now?
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
But try too hard --
Nightmare.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Screenwriter?
I can't believe you did that.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
you'll need one more hit.
Your favourite dish.
Yeah.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
That's fair enough.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Following new course. Warp seven.
Bob?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
The power was within you.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
Ah, Captain?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Spock.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is it possible?
A "t."
The emergency channel, open.
The ship needs its Captain.

It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Dillinger?
Hi, Alan.
My dinner.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Right on the money!
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Alan!
You're alive!
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
A User -- in our world?
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
But-what if I can't...?
Nice...
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
You seem fine now.
Harry!  Where are you!
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
I still don't believe it.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Put a tap on her phone.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Yes.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
What were you doing there?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Hello?
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
What is it you need me to do?
Has he looked through it yet?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
What do you do?
I don't remember.
You know when you sat behind me?
So he really loved her?
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
Uh-huh.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
I don't believe so.
Why?
Why Cancoon?
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Yeah.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
You got it.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Is he big league?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
I'd fuck Elvis.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
The police department?
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
I really don't know.
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I've seen him.
What are you talkin' about?
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
We gotta get him outta there.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Put it in your pants.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
What was the Jew-boy's name?
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What's she doing?
And your only goal is...???
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Change what?
No.
You're afraid of germs?
1995?
No, 1995 is the past.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
What does this mean to you?
You want me to rob him?
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
I'm not crazy.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
What's that mean?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
What?  What did you say?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
He no!
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
What do you want for free?
You don't fear death?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
It will.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Hey!
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Genuine Draft?
You didn't hear something?
Do you have to call me that?
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Where'd you learn to do that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Like they're made of polyester.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You know what I want.
No.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I can't.
From?
Because I know you're full of shit.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
To get my car.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
You killed him!
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Who the hell are you?
I'm a solid man.
Wait a second--
No.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
The time wasn't right.
Drop it, Jake.
You think that's a lot of money?
Yeah, well, me too.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
It's not like that.
It's the truth, Jake.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Christ, Jake, please--
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
But you was going to fight for me.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Stand up.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Soda.  You got any soda?
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
What do you want for free?
What?
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Who the hell are you?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
A lot that means.
Bobby Cooper.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You're talking like a madman.
You love her, but you hate her?
I need thirteen.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
So?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Accident.
What the hell happened to my car?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You believe that?
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
I'm just going to my car?
Nice place.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
I have an idea.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
You could leave him.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Nothing.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
You'd never understand.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Where?
What do you mean?
In <u>cash</u>?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
But I thought --
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Why's that?
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
One way, or round trip?
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You didn't hear something?
I axed you a question.
Yes?
Four.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Like what?
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
I mean if you knew karate?
I know now.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Rain's coming.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Books. He's my biographer.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
No?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
I could run off them whores.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
But... if he doesn't miss?
Did you... kill him?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Well, how about it?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
No.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
He ain't killed.
First one I ever killed.
You... gonna take... the money?
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
Yeah... you said that last night.
I seen him.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
Tom?
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
More.
I don't like the question.
His pistol must of jammed.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Keyser Soze
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
How do you do?
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
Tough break.
You watch your mouth.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
How are you, Keaton?
You're lying.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Who is he?
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
When does he post bail?
I'11 find him.
I know he was good.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Why didn't you say anything?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
Why lie about everything else, then?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
What does it mean?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
I'm just an M.D.
Through, through his book.
No.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
I thought I would need it.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
...I made a reservation at...
...What difference would...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes.
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
That happens.
Exception!
From the magazine?
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
Maybe I can do something right.
What happened...?
I've got to work...
You're talking like a drunk.
Yes.
I...do you want me to leave?
No...no...
Is it over?
What are you going to do?
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Uh ...
...he's a good man...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Been a long time, huh...?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
You use their witness.
The Doctors.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What did she do?
...yeah...good...
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I know.  I went ...
Yes.
Another, Frank . . . ?
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Should I?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
He won't talk.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
No.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
I want to know who you are.
Why?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
Scottie, what are you doing?
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Scottie!
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
Would you like some coffee?
I hope we will, too.
Do you know where you're going?
I don't like them.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
A grave...
What else?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
And it's a all real.
Madeleine --
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
More than you think.
It wasn't your fault.
It's where you belong.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
Uh-huh!
How's your love life, Midge?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
I think I can lick it.
Just wander.
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
But you said grey, sir.
I didn't hear you.
Multiple reasons.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Wait!
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Are you sure this was an accident?
I'm calling the police.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Have you ever done this before?
What?
So that's what we're doing.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
They won't figure it out.
Have you thought about what I said?
My god.
So. When is the wedding.
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Call 911.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Easy Boyd.
I said, what have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What?
What are you going to do?
Hear what?
Not a prayer.
The hell I did!
I don't hate women.
False.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Are we supposed to?
May we have the rings please?
What?
This is ridiculous.
Government cutbacks.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
He just doesn't talk a lot.
That's absurd.
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're leaving in three hours.
Take care of those chairs.
I will.
Of course.
I love you.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Okay.
What okay?
What's the word on the chairs?
I'm working on it.
I won't even discuss it.
Do you love me?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
But...
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
What?
You did all right dad.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
It means she's insecure.
He's your brother.
I'm getting married...
I don't hear it.
The first day.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Where's Boyd?
"You Send Me."
Shut up Micheal.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Give them to Refugio.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
You're lying.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
What will the lady say?
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
And in the vegetable plot?
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
Nothing.
What are you thinking about?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Kill him.
Why?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'll be ready.
No.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
How did you see me?
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
What happens if I can't catch him?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
How do you kill it?
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
How should I know?
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
You catching my drift?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
A little less than yesterday.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
I don't need a baby—sitter.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
What does that mean?
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
What the hell's going on?!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Which way?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
What do we do now?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
What are you saying...
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
It won't hold.
It won't hold.
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Twenty thousand dollars.
...the... 
Who's gonna tell'em.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>Nashville</u>...?
What are we going to do?
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
How's your wife?
That's not bad at all.
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
We're locked into Albania.
...you the Press Office?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
What do you want the kid to say?
Remember the Maine...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
I'm sure they do.
What do we have that they want?
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
In the Folk Music Section.
Mmm.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
...a masterpiece...
...what happened...?
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
Deal's changed.
It's too clean.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
You like it?
A beret.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
With their berets...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
No, I think..
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Start unloading.
Sell?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
What was that?
So what's the problem?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
He never told me...
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
And what do you want?
Well, why stop at that?
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
Do you think you're ready?
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
Hi.
Why?
Any better and I'd be guilty.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Would you like a closer look?
Thank you
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Sarah listen to me.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Can this be stopped?
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Mom.
I know that.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
No.
I've never even met you.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Thank you.
No.
What?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
Why are you here?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
...no...no...no...
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Oh...
What?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
I don't know.
She's awake.
How are you?
Not the focus.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
After that.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Think I may have cracked it.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
You didn't?
Where is she then?
Are you lonely?
Sweetheart--
I'm sorry...
Do I have everything?
I...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I was there.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
The leaves...
Look for antiques...
Huh.
I'm cooking you dinner.
Mmmuh...
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Michael, Rowan should -
Nothing was ever more false.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
My...mother...?
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
What is it...?
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Michael...  Do what you can.
FAST.
It is from love.
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Only you...
Oh god...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
What else did you see- Michael...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Do you love me, Michael...?
You look a little green.
Mm-hmmm...
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Your beneficence.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
Rowan Mayfair.
You really love this guy...?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
Yes it is...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I don't know...
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
Why did you let him in?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Who the hell was your father?
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
Get them together.
What gives, Don Corleone?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Yeah? You like?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
I guess.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Watch your tone, mister.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
I have absolutely no intention--
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Don't write that part.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Where are we going?
Whatever.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Come on.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Yellow pages?
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
You promise you'll finish school?
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
Rules are rules.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
As much as possible.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
Me? The King of Coitus?
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
People pay good money for that?
How quaint.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Talk to me Artie.
Take your time.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Ray, you heard him...
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
Are you crazy, Ray?
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
The teeth, were they...
What did you do then?
Thank you, Jimmy.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You are.
You're out of your mind.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Get off my property.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
No you don't.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Do it to ourselves?
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I'm here.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
You think that's wise?
Forget it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Just like that?
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
You can't...
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
That was about as grim as it gets.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Hi, Sandy.
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Always hoping.  Or this...
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
At least I tried something.
Jim, are you all right?
What way is that?
So... what happened?
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
French?
Yes sir.
No, sir... just a businessman.
When are they coming?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Why did you say that?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
You a woodcutter?
You gotta promise to feed her.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I just wanted to test it first.
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
I'm not going in there.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
I'm getting her out of there!
I've seen pictures.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Hey, Sam...
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Maybe.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Who else knows?
It's all over, Paul.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
They kid a lot.
Oh? Anything else?
Where are you taking us now?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
The... bullets?
We had some lemonade and he left.
But... You may not be well enough.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Where's my baggy pants?
Johnny, what the fuck?
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You'd lie to protect him.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
God, Fred...
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I have committed no sin.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
You might have killed him!
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
If she?
If any!
...resourceful!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
I thought you said she was dead.
Are you ready now?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
A home --
I have so got brains.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Ohhhh --
I don't blame you for that.
...along.
Yes -- there --
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
No -- No -- No -- No!
Somebody pulled my tail.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Yes, you.
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Stop pushing!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Whozat?
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
No, sir!
That's right.
Let's.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh - look out.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
You new?
Who’s she?
Construction’s not exactly my line.
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Who?
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
...what?
Was this all about the oil?
Valentin Zukovsky.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Hi, Jon.
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
Because --
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
I¹m not.
What if you¹re wrong??
Damn straight.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
They're following us.
What?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Those cars.  What year is this??
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
What about you?
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
What do I get out of it?
Not bad for a gimp.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Like what?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Mind your business.
Where are you going?
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Hey, you're good.
I'm from L.A.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
We'll have to go after them.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
You okay?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
That was for Anders.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
I wish I could go.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
How long have you been in Alaska?
If necessary.
I've seen a lot of rings.
The intention of registration act -
What are you going to do?
He helped you?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
And who might you be?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Still happy you married me?
Darling!?!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Yes, sir.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
A piece of what?
But, sir...
Frederick Frankenstein?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I thought you wanted to.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
What wockers?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
What is this place?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
Tonight?
Throw the second switch!
Who are you talking to?
Original.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
Where is he?
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
That sound good, boss.
There's only one way.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Would you like a sandwich?
Well, this explains the music.
Oh, doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
It wasn't me.
It looks that way.
I'd be so nervous.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Nor to Elizabeth.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, I will.
Foooooood!
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Yes?
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
