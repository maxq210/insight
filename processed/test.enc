You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
No.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Where've you been?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
What if she never starts dating?
Otherwise known as an orgy?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
You the new guy?
Thirty-two.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
What'd you do to her?
You makin' any headway?
I just upped my price
It's about time.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Nope - just came by to chat
Who's that?
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
What'd he say?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Excuse me?
You know who The Raincoats are?
Okay?
Like you could find one
Busy
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Because I like to torture you.
My insurance does not cover PMS
As a parent, that's my right
Macbeth, right?
Say it
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
She said yes.
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
There'll be a time.
Father...
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
How did you manage it?
I have to disagree.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
How old are you, Senor Colon?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
I'm coming with you.
What about Oleg?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
I can't take you to my place.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Vodka tonic.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Watch the news?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Two heads.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright.
Well, that's great.
Promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Any chance we can do that again?
Hi, I'm Honey.
In here, says he wants a million.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Yeah?
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
I'm trying to tell you.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
He knew all along.
What??
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Right. Just a sec.
Yes?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
What is it, Hal?
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, it is.
The antenna has to be replaced.
CONTINUED
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Yes, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
True.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Hey, what about me?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
How about it?
No chance.
Where's ganz?
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done.  End of story.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I don't give out the details.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Must be billy's girl.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
Just tell me about the money.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Where's luther?
We missed.
Partnership?
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah...
Jack?
What the bell happened?
That's what you say, Cates...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Who are all these?
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
So do you...been a long day.
A cop...
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Three more hours...
Hard man to live with.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
...would you like a drink?
You are a monster, Zorg!
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
What's she doing?
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Yeah?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
Yeah?
...Hi.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Don't you open your messages?
It's my wife.
Finished what?
Which one?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
It's up to you now, Angel!
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
It's not?
Have you identified it?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
What the fuck... !
I'll consider it.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
I'm camera shy.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Leave him alone.
Alright, Tom.
We do.
What's he talking about?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
You got absolute zero.
Don't think I won't.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Look, you cocksucker...
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Max.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Wha... ?
Who is he, his name?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Uh huh, pleasure.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
You don't have any other choice.
Okay, I follow you so far...
You told me to look, so I looked.
No.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
It got to be too much for him.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
I remember.  You just left...
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
We have matching luggage.
That obvious, huh?
No...
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Is there something we can do?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
What the hell was that?
T-T-Thanks Alice...
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
What's wrong with me?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Something wrong with the stairs?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Excuse us, dear.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Alice!
Had kind of a long night.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
Mark, are you okay?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Is there any way out of it?
Yes, Griff?
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Right <u>at</u> him?
But - what can we accomplish?
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
Are you alright, Wade?
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
You don't believe me?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Chub says you're fired.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
You might not kill it.
You played for the Sox?
Safety on?
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Yes.
Yes.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
What do you want, then?
I want to go home.
Want to buy?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Did you get his number?
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Alright. I'll think about it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
You're not using it today?
It makes me sad.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
What?
This town sucks.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Nothing.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Yeah.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Alice...
I'm sorry, honey.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
How?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Leave my daughter alone.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Stop.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
One.
I might still have a few chips left.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Felt like a large asteroid.
Dunn.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I'd use the word insane.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
That's not possible.
That's okay, ROK.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Both pilots!
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Ted, what are you doing here?
But Ted, you're the only...
Yes?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Yes?
Do you feel all right, sir?
The cockpit? What is it?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
William Harcourt?
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
How the hell do you know that?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Which one is that?  Raw what?
This is mole.  It's good.
I believe he is probably lying.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
I'm going home.
Where'd you get this?!!
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
That where Anderson worked?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
What kind of test?
Yeah, Sykes?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
How can I go?
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
You got your vest?
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Can't lock up...
Okay, let's do it.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
HOW MUCH TIME?
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
Still nothing from the colony?
One of us?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Save it.
Seventeen meters.
Now many?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Fuck you.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Gone.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Why not?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Why?
Did you know? Had you heard?
Well, what does it matter to you?
Sir -
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Humiliated?
Yes!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Tell them to go!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Wolfi!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Wolfi.
Oh, Stanzi.
I'm not telling you.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Oh, yes.
He's adorable!
Upstairs.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Excuse me, but how old are you?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
That's not what I hear.
They say you're in debt.
How many pupils do you have?
How many?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Wolfi!
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Madame.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Do you have a daughter?
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
But what is it they don't like?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
Are you ill?
Who?
Oh, yes.
And that's all?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you have it?
I am so ashamed.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Mozart -
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
All Vienna has heard that.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
Yes.
Ballet? What ballet?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Of course.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
How did he look?
He said 'Jack'.
Did he say a wolf?
Yes.
Yes.
He's here.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Will you think about it?
I was awake and he was in my room.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
The next corner we can get a cab.
But...
No.
No.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Did you hear that?
Jack?
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
Shut up, you zombie!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
I wanted to see you.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Dr. Hirsch?
What here?
He's on the telephone.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
No, thank you.
Matt?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Yeah.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
You understand?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Line?
Doesn't that come next?
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
No.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
You're protecting somebody.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
But I haven't . . .
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hello, Helen!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Oh no...
But if we take their money and supplies...
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
So what do we do, General Lee?
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
Perfect, Cole.
Sorry.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Yep.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Still smells fishy.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Missed you, cousin.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Cannon or Gatling?
Which one, right or left?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
So?
What do you say, sir?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
That would have made an impression.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You can shut up now.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Bob's upset.
You've killed your fair share of men.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
But still died.
Jesse, is that your hand?
What?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Where will you find such a girl?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Sparkling rocks?
Yep.
Me neither.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Hmm.
Let me see that.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
You cocky little bastard.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
This time we'll make an exception.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Good.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Stop it. I'm...
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
You just haven't been looking.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Why? What's wrong?
We never really shared one.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Uh huh.
Call me please, Patrick.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
Maybe it's just the light.
What?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
When?
Patrick?
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
Jean? Sorbet?
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Why?
What?
Well.
She's my...cousin.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Your address?
Who do you ask?
You sure?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yeah...Yale thing.
No. Not really.
Hang...out?
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
People just...disappear.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I've questioned him.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Al.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
Isn't that -- extreme?
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
Teddy was killed last night.
You can't just walk in, either.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Look at this.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Milo?
Here we go.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
No.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
Is it your software?
We could move 'em up here.
...Hello?
I do!
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Milo. What's up?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I think you should go.
You do?
Lisa.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Why were you snooping in my office?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Why?!
...You got my E-mail?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Who're these guys?
You seem surprised to see me.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Yes?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Be careful.
What's the other?
What?
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
What's wrong with your hand?
I'm sorry?
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
Not in the Nineties.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Are you crazy?
That's not mine.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Ow! You shot me!
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Sea bass.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Blow me.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Umm, that also has already happened.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Seriously?
You don't say. How real does it feel?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Have we met?
Quite a collection.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
The Institute ... the funding ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
My father always wanted a boy.
Do you?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
What on earth?
That's what we were working on.
Was I?
You followed me.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
I thought you didn't.
No idea who. No idea why ...
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
I see.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Privately owned by ...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Steed
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
You're better than I expected.
Rules are made to be broken.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Maybe it had something to do.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
God, you're a slob.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Um... that's very relaxing.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I can't trust you!
I don't believe you.
Let's get naked.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Why?
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Yes.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
So, Larry, how have you been?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Really?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Are any of those right?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Oops!
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Olivier's in that, right?
Under the table!
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Who was that?
What's this?
Who?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Did you do it for Tim?
Just come down, John. Just --
What, you've never seen one before?
Why'd you come here, Brian?
Roll the hose.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.
I know.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Huh.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Hi.
Okay.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Did you pull me out?
No.
Your brother was a good man.
I have a job.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
So, you surviving without me?
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
I was ahead of my time.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
I'm busy.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Didn't think you'd make it.
So what are you doing here?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Let me think about it.
I want 15 on the Mets.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Yes, Sister?
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
I'm not smiling.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
What's wrong with him?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
De-la-croix.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
That ain't funny.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
I'm wid it.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
This has to be a big mistake.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
I love you too, Daddy.
How long has my father been like this?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
You okay?
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
You've said that already.
For what?
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
How so?
Hi, Mona.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
So they can be on TV.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
How did you get this gig?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
You've never had any formal training, either?
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Not her, the one with the little...
I heard ya lady is wild.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
...too late, maybe around...
What do you want to know?
What else?
Why don't you answer?
You can go now.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
And so I am.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
I don't know.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Papa?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
There's no need...
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
I didn't shoot West --
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
You know it's not like that --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
What happened to "degrees"?
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
That bad?
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
Nevertheless --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
That is the most unprofessional --
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Something like that. You?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Something wrong?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
That bugs you too?
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
No.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you talking about?
I don't think I want to hear this --
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
He said what?
Dunbar says you were.
It won't work --
Thank God...
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
So?
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Who is she? Where does she live?
Someone stole my backpack.
Yes.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Fine, you do it.
Stop.
I never knew.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
What's your name, Giant?
You think I'm up for it?
What did he say?
When did you ever work in an office?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Dad!
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Oh.
Daffodils?
Wait! I need those!
This is why you don't show work in progress.
'Fraid so.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
You never told me how your parents met.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
You first.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Do you want to stop?
That's not a burn.
What? What are you doing?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
Leave him!
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Good. 
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
You're asking for my documents?
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
Put the fucking kettle down.
John.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Oh Jesus.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
Yes.
They go.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
In the world.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
So uh...
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Get out
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
Thank Christ for that.
I don't have nothing.
No.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I don't want anyone to die.
I don't know.
Okay. Thank you.
It's more like a date.
Is the flight full?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
You take her to a doctor?
What do you need?
Hey.
What happened?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Better than what you give.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
You sayin' you'll do what?
Teh... Tehronne?
Two days?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Itches.
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
I'm here with you.
Where you gonna be?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
What I love.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Shit. Who hasn't?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
You get a call from Rose?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Yes'sir.
Thank you.
You a preacher?
This ain't gonna work.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Are you wasted?
Ronnie. Please, baby...
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Thought you had a man for that.
Short shift?
All right, how's the new partner?
Nick!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
What's he saying?
Big enough.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
Yes...
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
Who am I supposed to be?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Yeah.
What...?  What if I say no?
I want a gun.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
You had my help, detective.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Death.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
You could help us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Just thought I'd...
You got a machine on it yet?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Got it.
Yeah.  I got it.
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
You equipped for random questions?
Do you have something against science?
Number three.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Let's hear it.
These aren't just...
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
What if you change your mind?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
How do you mean 'exploited'?
It's a good job.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
Dead.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Like?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
But then how can you...
This feels stupid.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
What?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Hi!
Yes?
My office.
Get out of here!
So far?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
Do you own a car?
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Take it. damn it!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Watching television in color.
Thank you.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Um-hum.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
All right.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
No way.
Okay. I like that.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I'm really sorry!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Is this because of the radiation?
How do I leave here?
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Like one of Mom's?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Juneau.
No.
Yes. He likes windows.
The recovery is very impressive.
What?
And thanks for always being happy!
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
What?  What is it?!
Sure.
How do you do, ma'am.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Thirty -five years!
Oh, no.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Hi, honey!
If he tells, it won't come true!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I forgot some of my stuff.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
What's it to you?!
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He left with Sophie.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
To get some frozen poultry.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Buy it from me?
Tower, say again!!
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yes.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Anything you can tell me?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay?
Not yet.
Jeffrey nothing.
Well.
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me, don't you?
I love you Don with all my heart.
He's comin' back? What for?
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
What?
Yes.
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
God, you scared me.
Yeah, I know.
Am I bothering you?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Where are they?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Yeah, but.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Look under the body.
What are you saying?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What happened?
Yeah, well...
What the fuck are you doing?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Would someone please come over here and...
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Nervous?
A bit.
Where the fuck are you going?
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
So what do you think?
He isn't to be touched.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
What?
You... oh god, why?
My, my...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
So what are you thinkin' here?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Who the...
Witness?
What the...?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Hey, Murph.
This is some crazy shit, man!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hello? You there?
Don't do this my son.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
I'm lookout.
You think we're going to be chased?
Dignan, calm down.
What about what that guy said?
Well, then cut it in half.
See if mine are in there.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
You owe me fifty bucks.
As long as he gets out OK.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I'm not. But there's --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
What time did he say to be here?
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
Uh-huh?
I don't know.
Come on.
Yeah.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
How does that feel?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
We're renegades from despair.
Future Man.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Was Future Man adopted?
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Like silk?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Yeah.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
I can't believe you said that.
I think we might of scared her.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
How long has he been in there?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
Just get in the car, Bob.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
I never agreed to that.
Come on, Bob.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Where's Applejack?
What's that?
Wait a second --
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Can't get it. It won't... 
Where is he? Where is Rob?
You Hoto?
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
...this is Conklin's computer.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
I can't let you do that either.
Because you're afraid!
Front. Use your teeth.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
-- what? --
Conklin up front.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
You drive.
-- where? -
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Who is Pamela Landy?
Say it.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
Abbott?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
So when was I here?
That's a lie!
Why am I alive?
We need to get in there.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Good luck.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
He was a modest man.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
What news of the north?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
No, M'lord.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
A common thief.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
I'm dreaming.
I need you so much! I love you!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
Why did you?
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I must... consult with my father.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
No dances, just tell me.
We're gonna be late again.
Can't he come out for one day?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Weirder than this?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
What the fuck are you doing?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Different? How?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
Know what?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
And you are...?
Huh?
Meant no offense.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Lenny? Come on!
Shut up, Tommy!
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
I'd better be going.
What do you want for Sam?
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Yes, something.
And Mademoiselle?
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Please.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
How did you get in?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Put them on the table.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
It's been a long time.
When will he be back?
This time they really mean to stop me.
What happened with Rick?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
What of it?
I said, ask your wife.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
May we proceed with the business?
Yes.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
Manages what?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, it's my party.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
What friend?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
What is your nationality?
There seems to be no secret about that.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Get me the Radio Tower!
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Just a little something of my own.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Fix raft first.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
I had it on the island with me.
Sonofabitch!
I can't even keep fish alive.
You can't go now.
This isn't working out.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
I got married.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
And how was your Christmas?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
What happened to your pants?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Can you find her?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Hello?
I beat the odds!
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
I need to do it.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
These *credentials* are against the law!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
And that I can drive a truck!
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I know.
People watched the movies in their cars?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Nothing.
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
I can't go nowhere.
I never said they were boring.
That's true.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Did you grow up around here?
Have you enlisted?
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
So. What should I do now?
I'm stayin', Homer.
In other words, scurvy.
I am not a doctor.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
But you don't look very happy.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
It look nicer then home!
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
Silicon Valley?
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Sort of like a letter of intent.
We had to finalize the deal.
Ten percent. Of how much?
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
You're a superstitious fucker.
We were back on.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Whoa. What?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
You can't cheat an honest man.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Excuse me?
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Something stupid.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
He's gone.
Uh-huh.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
How do you know I will?
Lily... Jesus Christ...
Jesus... Take it easy.
What about what?
Your mess.
Then shut up.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
Uh...
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
You going to have the time?
King ain't gonna like this.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
In over your head?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Special Agent?
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
That's it?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
The Indian rope-trick.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
All right. As what?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
How's that football story corning along?
How did you land that?
It came my way. 450 a week.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you trying to read my palm?
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
Marion. It's a book.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
You were talking in your sleep.
I hate public transport.
Great.
Found a job?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
They mean it.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Of course I recognised him!
I'm Lucy.
Over the river.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
No thanks.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
How many aces are left?
Five.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
How?
She's not in the gaming business is she?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
I just want the job.
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key, goddamit, the key!
What the hell?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
All right, then...
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
-- automatic channels open --
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Doolittle! Help me.
Oh yeah?
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Ah... pity, pity...
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
I'm on a break.
That's not why we're here.
What're you talkin' about?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
What the hell are you doing?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
I don't get involved with guns.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Mommy, I'm scared.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
I won't be staying.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
How well do you remember the lab?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
Well, not me personally.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Any idea when she'll be back?
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Thank you.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
No.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Not right now.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Hey, Sketchy--
Max--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
How'd you get her out of town?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She was the one--
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Dude, this is all I got.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
They're what?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
It was stolen!
I got...
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Grounded for the rest of the year?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Yeah.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
What did you say?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Why is that?
That was a compliment.
Why?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
And what?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
What?
Come with me.
No. Frank.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
I know, Dad.
Why should we care?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Frank.
I think he saved my life.
Yes.
Four times... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
A sign from whom?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
But you were punished.
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
I was just being honest.
What?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Yep.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Mrs. Leeman?
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
We was robbed.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
Ohio...
The bitch.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
So help me, Gladys.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Nothin' too showy!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh! What is it?
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
"My dear"...
Send for my car...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
What kind of a dog is he?
Oh no, I can't do it.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Go ahead.
Was it -- swine?
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
I thought everything was working out fine.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
What is it?
What are you going to do?
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Good morning, sir.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Don't we?
How are you feeling today?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Good day...!
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
Yes!
Merrick...
...Yes potatoes... but...
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
How is your tea, John?
Yes.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Right! Where is he?
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
We never went to bed together.
"The fifth one this week"!
We mustn't let him land!
Just give me a hand.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Do you believe I love you?
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
I see the world.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Is there nothing men can do?
No. 
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
I'll tell you what...
Why?
Don't talk nonsense.
Aaagh! Rape!
I didn't mean to!
You told them I raped you -- why?
What?
I met this girl...
No! Let go, Snorri!
There is another way.
I think we should go...
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
He hasn't.
Can't make enough swords!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
YOU do it!
She knows it was our fault!
You went berserk...
Well, go on! Go berserk!
Yes, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
Thanks, guys.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
And I just liked you so much.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
I'm sorry.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
I'm not a stalker.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
You like that?
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
Thanks.
No, not at all.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You'll call me, right?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Egad, were you horrified?
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
Yeah?
Not yet. Not married.
I remember that speech really well.
You know what I did.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I do sort of live with somebody though.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
What if you stay this time?
Says you were a bully...
Doesn't sound like me.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Clementine.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Naomi.
Well... I did.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
So you don't mind?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Oh, hey, Patrick.
That's a good one.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Well, what should we do?
And after that?
I know what it is.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
I have a family, Mary.
Stan? What's going on?
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
You don't?
About...
What guy?
I have to go, Julian.
Going north?
Bonanza Jellybean?
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
From what?
We have a man down...
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
Hear what?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
His peritoneum has ruptured...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Any survivors?
No one?
It's insane.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
You have something, Dr. Weir?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Skipper...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Who?
Miller...
Go ahead.
You've got to listen...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Can you see a body?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
He's engaged the override.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
What is it?
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I mean...
He didn't.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
What's wrong with me?
No more cracks about how I look.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
He's not responsive --
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Apparently I can disappear.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
How's the IPO?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Of course. Of course.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
I can... make it work.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
It's just business.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
They're not home yet.
Is everything okay at work?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Hey, Mike?
Take that back.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Poor guy.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Are you Linda Barrett?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
That's him! He did it!
What variables?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
It couldn't be.
What do you want?
Dartmouth?!
Yes.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
What's that?
Well, you'll find out next year.
That's a nice shirt.
Thanks for coming to get me.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Do you really have to go?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Naked!?
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Where'd you get that knife?
WELL? What are your plans?
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
Right!
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
We should go! We should go right now!
They'll be back.
Where are you two going?
I think I know where a CB is.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
They're right here.
What tunnel? Where?
You all sure about this?
We just smeared a skunk.
Just an observation.
What now, Geronimo?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
I'm in.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
How much you got?
How much you got to see the show?
What's going on between you two?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Nine?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I wouldn't do that, son.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
COME ON!
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Am I too heavy for you?
Yeah, I'll go.
Not without you!!!
Oh...
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
He's not here.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
Showdown.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
I know that, Dad, but --
Are you... are you hungry?
I'm going back to the hotel.
Good.
Why?
They'll mend.
Okay then...
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Kaminski.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Oh my God, I look awful.
I should've known...
Huh?
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
I guess.
What's that?
Frances, You're crazy.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Fine!
What happened? Who're you?
I live here.
But I want to. I'm trying!
'But how do I know you love me?'
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
The speech? Real good.
Mama...
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Mama, what's...
Why are these all opened?
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Normal. Average.
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Frances, I'm warning you...
No!
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
What kindness?
Friends? Do they live around here?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
What is this?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
They just caught the man who did it.
I've been preoccupied.
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
For what?
Electricity.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Your men are right to be afraid.
Do you share my madness?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
You can only do what you can do.
What's the matter with it?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Sure.
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Are you wet?
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
One night on the town.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
What was that?
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
What about Kate?
What's your name?
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Not a chance.
Yes.
Where is the little lady?
She's dead?
How'd she die?
Yes.
Yes.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
You won't let him touch her?
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
He backed down.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
That happens, you'll get it back.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
What's going on?
Where are you taking us?
Yes.
Yeah, we got a bible.
I'm sorry.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I wasn't scratching!
Whiskey!
What the fuck was that about?
All I'm saying --
This isn't gonna work.
No, I didn't.
That's what you look like.
He needs our help!
Who's...  Lieuten --
Got it.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Your prerogative, Senator.
I'm fine, sir.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
No, sir, WHAT?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
So I'll get a fair shot?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Fine by me, sir!
Entering my scan now...
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Uh, question, ma'am.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
You'll think about my offer?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Sir?
Time.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Chances of recovery?
This has nothing to do with you.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Well, now I feel so much better.
Do you, uh, know...
'Cool?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
"Dad."
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
The first female President?
I don't know.  Seems...
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
He stole my report! That's my report!
You okay?
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
I'll take them all.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Wish me luck!
Can I use some?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman...
Well, I think you're cute.
They didn't make it.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
I think we should leave now.
What'd they say?
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
This is it?
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
You go first! There's no time!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Yes. Good was done this .....
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
And note the sucked in gut.
He's a miserable twit!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
No I didn't.
He always has to make the big entrance.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
What do you mean?
Shit! Go!
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
No, I'll kill you. .
I am SO SICK of being right.
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
We're doing episode 31?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
But I'm the Commander!
Jason..
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
How does the rolling help, actually?
What?  What did he say?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
Gwen...
You're kidding. When for?
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
Then how did he find out about the device?
But there it is!...
Wh... Where are we?
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
Well, what have you thought?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
We've got powder but no ball!
How old are you, Captain?
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
Lafayette is a child!
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Oh, come now...
Partially...
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
Any word from Canada?
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
They help me understand why we fight.
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
I only meant...
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Martha... what?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
What the hell are we doing?
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
George, I'm sorry.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
What are you doing?
All people have rights!
My daughter, I ask only...
You're kidding me, right?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
Calm down, Bear...
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
What about her?
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
You know Laurel Canyon?
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
I can't do it.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
What three hundred grand?
What?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
I'm in the movie business.
You have a card in here?
Something shouldn't be there.
Leo spanked a waitress?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
You pack a gun?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Who?
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Personally?
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Martin, look at me.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
I'm up twelve grand today.
How'd you know I was here?
What're you doing here?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
I want to know.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
What took you so long?
Whatta you doing out there?
Pick 'n' Save.
I don't have a dog.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
What is your first name?
Ready?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
How long?
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
What is it?
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
What?!
Don't lie to me!
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
What's slow?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Why not call for help?
Who?
He needs a doctor.
Same. Any luck?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
But where's the damage?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
Murphy to Epps.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
What?
So you killed them?
I must be in the wrong business.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
What now?
We could call for help.
Pretty low all around.
Ho-ly shit.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Leave it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
What are you trying to say?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
What do you mean?
Huh?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
Yeah, right.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Did you sign up yet?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
So what should we do?
I want to do him!
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
Ew, look at this...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
Ew ... when did you get that?
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I totally, totally hate you.
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
But those are our people...
You're gross.  See that guy?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
You're insane.
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
How repulsive!
Just some people from work...
He came into work.
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
Wow... finally.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Indian records?
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Wow!
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
So is that your boyfriend?
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Yes, that would certainly do...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Yeah, but still...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
No, of course not.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
...What do you mean?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
She's not at home?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
How; we don't know where they are?
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
I do need to see Starling.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Goddammit!
Good news?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Certainly.
I won't.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
So this is what you do, huh?
Are you all squeaky clean now?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Is this the spot?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
This is the one that looked at Dana.
Command me, lord.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
What now, Brainiac?
Who was that?
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Does it have any favorites?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Hi, Louis.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
That's a violin concerto.
That's too bad.
Don't scream.
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Yes, it would.
That's "Peck!"
What do you mean "bad?"
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Ray -- Something's here.
How do you know?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Why do you play at being drunk?
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
He killed his father and then my family...
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
What the hell was all that about?
Serious stuff...
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
This is our oil from our estates?
Narcissus!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
No -- why should I?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
Was she married or something?
All right.
You do?
Where are you meeting this person?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Yes.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Come in.
What?
What did she say?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
Benjamin?
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
No.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Are you listening?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I'm in the bathroom.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
What?
The Singleman party, sir?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
But it's light in there now.
All right then.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Pardon?
What's wrong?
What do you think?
It's all right.
Sit down.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
I know that. But I'm --
What are you so scared of?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Get away from that door.
Did you get us a room?
What?
That's fine.
Thank you.
Why don't you watch?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Always?
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
How many times a year.
No.
See if you can guess.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
I wish you'd tell me.
Yes.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
May I stay then?
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
No -- actually I'm not --
Can I talk to you a minute?
What else?
Oh, no.
No.
Have you thought about graduate school?
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
What?
Sir?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
It's Benjamin.
Benjamin Braddock.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Need any help?
I could take care of her.
You can't.
Who?
Chasing around.
You were very different yesterday.
Oh!
And -- and --
Yes -- tired...
Am I quite strange to you?
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
I know.
Grusinskaya --
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Very early in the morning.
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
That was my last.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
It's always so quiet here.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Everything?
I'm engaged for the evening.
Yes.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
What?
Later?
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
What?
How nice -- your daughters?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Hello!
No -- now.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Come here. 
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Let us cancel the engagement.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
You're discharged.
Yes, the police must be called.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Four minutes past. Please come.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
What you need is some relaxation.
What do you want with her?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Hi, Bobo.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
What? He's going to be all right!
Well, make it stop!
Why? What's wrong?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
Well, uh... No.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
At what?
What?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Let me see how you did that one.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
That's just Lilly's way.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Working the what?
Myra, I'm not following this.
Nobody does that single-o.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Well, when you put it that way.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Where?
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Carter.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Another historical inaccuracy.
No.  Wait for the police.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
It's an option.
Now you're joking, right?
Why didn't you tell me?
Where'd you get it?
Then you come out here.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Looks great.  It does.
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
What now?!
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
This is madness, Wynn.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Jamie's baby ...
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Hm?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
You know what gets me?
Home.
You know what gets me?
Tell them yourself!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
Can I have the Cadillac?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
So long, Colonel.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Fifty years?
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
Gee whiz--
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Hello.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
She met him at college.
He insults him all the time.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Dad--
What kind of exercise?
Gee whiz, Dad--
It's your house, Dad.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Some kind of animal?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Bluh.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
It couldn't!
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
A dozen?
He cried.
Two hundred years old.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
Ah!  The lady is armed.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Help your mother find the bullet.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
I was going to ask.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Now who's being cruel?
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
I'm an honorable clown?
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
I see.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
My violin is avenged!
The new hero is you.
Was I ever of use?
What is this thing that kills me?
There was so much going on.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
What happened?
I'm only ten years old.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
What's this?
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
I didn't know that.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
That man is your father.
I don't get it.
Then get him.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
Yes?
I'm touched.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I'm sorry.
You're saying no.
You were wonderful.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
I'm amazed.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
Get out of here.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Is that a fact?
You've got to fight from time to time.
Or get eaten alive.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Well, I want to...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Wait?
Just one.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Overpowering?
Are you a private detective?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
At least I'm a growing person.
No.
How important do you think sex is?
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Why do you say that?
Granville?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
...What do you have to offer?
Mr. Van Dorn?
I've got a meeting...
I don't know.
They're legal now.
But the police...
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Where'd you hear that name?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
What is it, Jake?
Is Marsha there?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
I want to meet Ratan.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Okay.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
In other words, you want to get laid?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Com'on, tell me.
What does that do?
To his own daughter?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who's that?
You're taking a big chance.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
Eh, Poli Sci?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Okay, lady. Out.
But there is a family resemblance.
Wait here.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Eh, no. Thank you.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Yes.
All right.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
You look as if you could.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
But what?
But we can't just dig it up!
Oh, my. We're too late.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
No more revolts.
But I don't play anything.
Yes.
You are the wisest person I know.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
With God?
Well, why don't you?
Maude.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Mother. I'm going to get married.
I'm getting married.
At a funeral.
Do you play?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
And why is that?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Well, I don't...
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Frank.
You knew?
I want to go back!
I... I had a visitor.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
I'm scared.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Steve...
You were burned by some organic acid.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
What the hell was that? An ape?
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
That voice --
-- should go back. Now!
Whatcha looking at, John??
Myers??? How's your arm?
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
Myers?
Well good n-
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
Hello, I'm --
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Christ!
We've got such sights to show you --
You were holding onto it like grim death.
You bastard --
Oh.
Julia.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
You would be. They tore me apart.
I was here this afternoon.
We're going to freeze to death.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
How long since you were here?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
No. I'm not.
What have you done?
Are you all right?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Maybe a brandy.
What?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Why don't you do the same?
You wouldn't believe me.
I got through.
Where are you?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Of course. Every day.
Call me tomorrow.
You like?
What are you drinking, love?
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Finished?
He's gone.
I won't be able to stand.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
If there's a train.
Your father told me you were working here.
Can I lend you a hand?
Do I know you?
I beg your pardon?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
What's next?
Nice, Barry.
Not the point.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
We can take your car.
What are you snickering about?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Hey.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Fuck off, Barry.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
What?
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
On Clark Street!
Anna.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Don't do it, Rob!
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Oh.  Okay.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Nice friend.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
'Morning, Dick.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Are you all right?
I understand, Dick.
Rob.
Can I do anything?
Laura?  Are you okay?
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Did you say something?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Yeah.  Great.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
That bad, eh?
Mmm hmm.
Sure they are.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Pig died.
Look, are you coming or not?
I don't want to go back.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Laura...
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Want to know what, exactly?
To make you feel better.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
How?  How were we the same people?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Harder.
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
Would you marry me if I was?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
What difference does it make?
Enough, Liz.
You share a place with T-Bone?
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
So you'll stay?
Everything all right?
Well call her mother.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
Seventy-five.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
How old is Richard?
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
Would you remember his name?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Good reflexes.
You have an active imagination.
Where?
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Have you gone to the police?
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
Yes.
He is older than I.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
You're not from these parts.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
It is as you are.
It is the truth.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
But why be so concerned about me?
I have no future husband.
But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
State of grace and all that.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Finish your prayers?
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
We have no understanding.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Are you sure?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Where!
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
_Answer_ me.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
What's the point?
Leave her alone.
What are you getting at?
Where were you Tuesday night?
Do you?
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
What doing?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Too hot?
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
How's business, Bruce?
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
What's this?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
I have a lunch date. I just want --
I know, Walter, but I --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Sweeney.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Please! Will you just --
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
The insurance business?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Now you got me.
What for?
Allow me.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Hello -- hello...
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
What!
Well, that about covers everything.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Pete, you're through!
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
We'll fix that, too. 
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Hey --
Are you all right, now?
What's from the Governor?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Is it hard?
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Baldwin -- his name is.
What's that?
Can I try?
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
I never was.
What's that?
You wouldn't.
Pauline.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
They've got the real thing outside.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
I don't know?
What did we know? We were seventeen.
And what's that?
Well?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
The ideas you get in your head.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
You're having me on, Molly.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
He walks, duh.
What's this?
No, really.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Go around him.
Quiet.
What are you doing!
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
No, just a little too old.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Thank you.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Who's your Daddy!
Fit the profile?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Is everything fine?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
I am sleepy.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Unnhh.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Nice night.
Ouch. Yeah?
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Nathan told my brother.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
How's it going?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
My God! The fork! The fork!
You really enjoy my company?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Of course.
Yes.
Flares?
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Bravo to you, Puff!
So he's doing okay?
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Yahoo!
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Ugnh.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Mm hmm.
Check!
Do we need words?
I'll make it up to you.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Okay?
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Thanks for the drink.
Seventy-five per cent.
For me.
Hello, Eddie.
Hi. How's business?
Man named Turk Baker?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
How're the hands?
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Half.
Yeah, that's right.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Whaddya mean?
It's quiet.
In the gut, I mean.
Quit. He's too good.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Eddie...
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Just like that?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Yeah. You must come again.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Long wait for a bus?
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
Thanks.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
I'm hungry.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Haven't you opened it?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
A loser?
Why did he tell you?
Is he a winner?
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
California. Oakland.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Do you remember where you lived?
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
What?
Why don't you start with me?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What do you want?
Do you still want me to stay?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Need some gas?
So, what do you do?
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I left it at work.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
You have to leave the White House.
David? How'd you get this number?
He's a good man.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
There's good news and bad news.
What're you talking about?
What happened?
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Perfect, she's using it.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Yes, I am.
It's all fuzzy.
But I gave you some this morning.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
How' he doing?
Can they be killed?
Many worlds...
Marcus!  I did it!
Ah, Venice...
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Mine, too.
No. You like the way I do things.
What do you know about this place?
You came back for the book? Why?
All I have to do is squeeze.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
And the chair.
What?
Dad!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
I know, Dad!
Now, who are all these people?
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
I don't need camels.
Then we'll die.
All right! Where's my father
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
You think so?
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
No.
Come one, what's wrong?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
THE WHAT?!
What's happening?
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
What about the future?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Oh really?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
I want to go home...
Indy? Did you talk to them?
So now they believe me.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
Try me.
Don't do that.
Yes?
Yes.
Where are we?
...I need to make a phone call.
Right.
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy.
What was that?
You weren't listening!
Anyone there?
What do I do?
Did you hear that?
Yeah...Who is?
You are CRAZY!
What do you mean we.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
Find You?
Black suits and helmets.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
I'm at the airport.
I don't have any.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
The beach.
The beach?
Eating sushi?
It's sand.
Beautiful!
What?
It is my business. It's my name.
I feel like an idiot.
Which one?
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Joe, be careful!
How do you know?
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
It's not your time. I get time off.
Bingo.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
What do I do?
What are you doing?
He was with Gruner!
I don't trust her.
It's him.
And Dieter?
Aim just in front of his face.
Do something.
Never mind that, where are we now.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I'll get us out of here.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
What are you doing?
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
What is your name?
Oh, I can't.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
PEM115!
Yes?
That name's familiar.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Nothing.
Dinner...tonight.
What way?
I waited for you.
Why?
Disinterest?
I am sort of scattered.
That you're not crazy.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Why did you stay with me?
Why?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
You know where he went?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
Where what?
Chiang Cho?
Can you?
I can't fly it.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kiss her you fool.
It wasn't me. It was him.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
It'l take months.
Instant rice...?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
P.J.'s.
Push it.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Get me Wigand.
Good.
You're exaggerating!
So, what are you going to do?
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
What caliber is my gun?
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
What's going on?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Where should I wash them?
What are you and Mike going to do?
Jeffrey Wigand...
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Yeah.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
I disappeared on you?
Who's that?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Far as you go where?
How much would I get paid?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
No.
What does this have to do with my testimony?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You greased the rails!
Where are you, anyway?
Did he hear you?
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
You threatening my family, now, too?
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
No!
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
Yes?
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Have you tried the duck?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Screw you, asswipe!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Is that you?
Me. Yes.
Your mother was.
We're damaged goods.
What is it Miles?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I know.
Fabric and fringe.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Rex. Get away from the door.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Marylin?
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Maybe.
Shit.
You're not...
Mr. Massey --
That's delusional.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Where does that leave us?
Thank you.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
Yeah.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
South America!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Please don't shout.
Oh, no.
Ridiculous!
Well!
Peter Warne! 
Why should she? After all—
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
What happened?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
No.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
My ticket?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
That's right. You didn't.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
Now, just a minute—you can't—
Are you talking to me!
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
I can't go out like this.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Um. You're doing all right.
Detectives!
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
Why, haven't you—?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
You're crazy.
That's silly.
You're prejudiced.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
Well, take them off.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
know—but—
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Raw?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
Oh, no!
Clever.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What're you going to do?
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
What about money?
That's swell!
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
The dame's too smart for him.
What's up?
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Yeah.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
What's up?
What's on your mind?
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
And Oswald?
Recall any names?
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Keep saying what?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
What did they...
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
I see.  And where did you drive?
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Then who killed the President?
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
No, you don't!
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
How many shots you say you heard?
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't imagine where.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
David Ferrie.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Nonsense.  What next?
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
Huh?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
Time?
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
It never did. 
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
The assassination, Jack?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
This looks pretty good on me.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Uh-huh.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Great, you're here.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Take your time.
You don't want much, do you?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
That doesn't sound dark.
Was she helpful?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
With ten thousand? Nine.
Cash poor?
What'dya think?
If you're having some.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
Fifteen thousand.
Who was your girl before Annette?
What're you, a bag lady?
You don't actually do it that way?
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
Which one?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
I hesitated taking that much.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
Where're you going?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
Who's side are you on?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Most of the times.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
No.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
She didn't say.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
There was a guy with Melanie?
If it'll make you happy.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, do you like it?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
What do you think it is?
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Didja tell 'em anything else?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Plus the same deal as before.
Uh-huh.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
I can sit through it once.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Four days ago.
Four years?
Bank robbery.
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
The roller disco one.
No.
With Ordell?
C'mon, don't lie.
Wanna fuck?
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Yeah, down the end.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
So we on the same page then?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Did you get it?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
So what, you left her there.
Pretty sure.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Where you shot her.
What'd you shoot her with?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
Maybe the Feds got it.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Tell me.
You don't say.
Hey, Max.
I can see that. Why?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
How'd you find me?
How the fuck did he find me?
In a way, yes.
And where's Jackie?
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
You expect me to just walk in there?
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
Turn left.
My money's in that office, right?
Uh-huh.
We're back.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What are you then?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
Della?
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Oh God!
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
It was the window.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
You need ... a doctor.
What do you mean, demons?
Not me, buddy.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
What can I tell you?
I had this weird flash just then.
What are you doing?
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
I haven't seen her in months.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Christ, I know how it sounds.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I don't want to know.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Gee, thanks a lot.
That help?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Yeah, but for what?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Not to me.
Ready?
Jake!
I'm going home.
When was the last time I said a word?
Show me Della!
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Who else were you expecting?
Stay away from me, Jez.
Don't!
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Long time ago.
Shows how much you knew.
How was Palm Springs?
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
I'm awake?
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
Who is?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
You've seen them?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
The army?
You come home with me.
Died?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Can we blow it with just two?
Better let me.
Shit!
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Not a chance.
Where is he?
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Pull me in!
Where are you going?
Outta here?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Rizzo?!
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Old woman?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
She needs a little time.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
They'll make it.
You must shut down the engines.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
You're so bossy.
Robot huh?
Kay-em 14.
Almost done.
Ow!
Do I have to?
What?!!
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
What good will that do?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
You got it.
What do you mean 'We...?'
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
What do we do?
I didn't know her.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
Do I set the goddam hook?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Well... is everything all right?
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
I'll drink to your leg.
He's heading under -- !
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
What's up?
I don't like Katrina.
You're being really immature.
Wait, let me take that.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
When was this, like '96?
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Why? What the big deal?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
You should try Adderall.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Juno? What's going on?
Who is the kid?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Dad, no!
What?!
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
You're not listening to me.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Adele for god sake please lis...
What?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
No it is not!
Adele... are you serious?
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
...thank you.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Now why is that?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Up yours.
Fuck!
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Carrie, watch for Early.
What are you going to do?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
...That'd be my guess.
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Yeah.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
What do you want?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Why?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Yep.
I hate this game.
Man, this guy is really good.
Darcy?
Why I do what?
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Nah.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Do you care about me?
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Because, you know why. You know.
Why is that?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
I'm sorry.
What?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
You didn't?
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Wish me luck.
And you don't get shit out of it.
But then I won't need your money.
Mom.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
Casual.
What?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
How'd you get in here?
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
You want me to what?
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
We'll find the evidence.
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
You'll find her.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Hello?
Just for that no hint today.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
How?
Very good.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Nope.  Nothing.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Feeling better?
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Six, eight hours tops.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
I'm busy right now.
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
Through a rental agency.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Peter...
Bainbridge Books.
Bainbridge Books.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Are you with the tournament?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
Well, I think I've had enough.
I think it's interesting.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
Why?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
What is this?
Peter, you have to admit--
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
You're going to be late for your match.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Well, you're beautiful.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
We're almost married.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
I lied.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Colwyn ...
Yes.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You have rope?
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
I can't reach her.
I'm not sure.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
Use your sword.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I ache with it.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Fame.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
You will follow me.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Hand over your dinner.
Go, join them.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
A venison pie as big as a house.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I'm hungry.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
Look at its insides.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He is the King.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
You were attacked in the forest?
It is the time.
Each to his fate, lad.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
Knowledge.
You lie!
You will come with me.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
No, no.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
What, for example?
OK.
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Not taken.
What?
Mathilda?!
A little...
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
I don't know... Five minutes.
Yes?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Huh? That's smart!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh?
Huh? Why?
No...
He probably just went somewhere.
Are you two planning kids?
Maybe later.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
Thank you.
What steps do we take now?
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
You thought I sent them?
What?
I do love you... very, very much.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
He's plastered.
Where?
Go to sleep Ellen.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Perhaps there's another route?
Mammoth.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Why know?
What Mr. Parker?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
What, come on?
No.
Coffee?
Hello!
Hello.
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Don't run away.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Sera you are crazy.
Hi!
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
What was that all about?
Please!
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
But it's a top three school --
Were you with another man?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Sit down.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Uh -- both?
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
No!
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
No.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
Relation?
Name?
Our group is full.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
What?!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
You really think I'm attractive?
Up for a celebration dinner?
Neither.
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
You're beautiful.
And I fully support that.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
I completely agree.
That's not entirely --
You go where?
Pink ones.
Three months.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Elle?
Always.
We go out, smash 'em now?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
You... you're a beast!
Protection?
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Or looked so beautiful...
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
Gump, is it?
Enough!
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Don't you know?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
What do I do?
And if she thinks me a liar?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
What is it?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There aren't enough arrows.
Will you chance a miss?
One more turn...
He'll not escape me.
You see!  You see!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Unicorn?
Are you honest?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Pinching me!
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
How do I get the horn back?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
No!
And charmed, of course.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
And am I not fair?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Where?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Mom said I should.
Mom?
Atonement.
Why?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
My mother would die.
What did you think it would be?
I don't know.
You look better without make-up.
I might not stay, anyway.
I don't want you to!
Does everything have to have a point?
Not really.
You hate your father.
I don't wanna go.
It could have been a squirt gun.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I have the permit.
I'm good, thanks.
Pardon me?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
How's your wife?
Right...she married...what was he?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
I've been here twenty years.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
I'm sorry.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
I did warn you.
I forgot where I put my keys.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
Because I live there.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I can promise you complete privacy.
You're too fucking late.
I took some of your Vicodin.
That's not true.
Getting high, I guess.
To hide a black eye.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
Are you taking them still?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
Can you build a house in four months?
Money?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I love those doors.
The garage.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
I did say he could go.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Finished or unfinished?
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
I smiled at him.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
That was the truth.
Let's not do this, okay?
I could die.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
Should I?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
Sam took them to a movie.
Hey.
Why?
Adam, that's not true!
Nagger?
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Then what's the problem?
She's alright, isn't she?
Want me to come back some other time?
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Yes, sir.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
That's because I've never been here before.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
That's right, a loan officer.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Still got that ten dollars?
That jelly you were talking to right here?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
I don't know. Who do you want?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
I can't do it.
What'd you say?
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
You ever done time before?
Made just for you, Cookie.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
So it don't exist.
Wait for the firemen!
Lemonade?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
What's your name?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
All right. Let me out.
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
What's Nicky doing down there?
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Coulda been much worse.
Thanks.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
What was it called, sir.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
So I followed him...
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Yes, great movie...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
Hey.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Where do you think we came from?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
That's better.  How do you want us?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Your own work?
Why?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
Anybody we know?
Why did you do that??!!
Where do you live, Mary?
What's wrong, Available?
I'm afraid to tell you.
Why is it wrong to run?
K.
You could have called me yourself.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I'm going to run.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
Please? What friends?
Of course --
They're like beasts. Wild.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
What's that?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
What does that water do?
Yes...
No.
Hello, Sandman.
Not yet.
We're leaving.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
More... many more.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Well? How do you like it?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
What do you mean by that?
What is?
Maid? Relative?
Might be a good time to try using it again.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
I was here yesterday.
It's me...
Hello.
So, should I call Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Set.
Dick Laurent?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Okay. Thanks.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
No.
We saw you that night, Pete.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
A headache?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Same one you were reading the other night?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
The heart, I guess.
I can see that.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
At sixty?
Pornos?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
All of it?
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Yes!
Will you stop squawking!
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Have I?
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Nothing. Why?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Centuries.
Well, is it?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Very often.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
Now, what would you like to do?
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
As far away as I ever want to be.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Sondra Bizet.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Let me up! Let me up!
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
I'd go mad!
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Bump?
Why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Sir--
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Why?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
what's this?
You think that's what's-happening?
Kay--
What are you doing?
Since how long?
in case I need it?
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
They respond to fear, right?
Come on now.  People are smart.
It's... coming.
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Will it lower the curve?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
How's Dee?
Kay?  What's your 20?
He's gone, too.
And they're buying it?
They went right to the President.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Take it.
Please --
Oh, God...
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
John?  What is it?
And replace them with new ones.
That's not much.
From where?  D.C.?
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
... Graveyard shift.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Sir?
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
To them.
Really?  You've never been inside?
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
She spoke to me.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
So?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
What about the picture --
The what?
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
If... you have one.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
How do I even know which one has it?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Then how did he --
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Lamar --
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
It's the same prevision.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
There a maid in this hotel?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Who?
That was our apartment.
To what?  Trap him?
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
What's 'incidentals?'
What if I gave you forty?
As far as...?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
I know.
We used to take baths together.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Uncle Bobby?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Oh, please.
You talk to Max today?
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Get your hands off of her.
He making the drop?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Brooklyn.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Quick drop. In and out.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Where's Ricky.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
A million. Easy.
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
I don't understand.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
You want --
Take a few days --
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
We get it. We're sorry.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Taken care of?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
We're with Ruiz.
Ruiz isn't here.
Can you check?
So?
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I thought you hate that club.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
I gotta pick up the baby.
What? Did she say something?
Right here's fine.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Who you calling?
How much is it?
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Nothing else.
You know this guy?
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
We're not getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
The penguin house.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
You're out of money?
What about it?
Calm down.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Dude, we were practically made...
Fine, fine. And you were...?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want to come splash around.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Cool. See you later.
Ugh...
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Where do you live?
You strapped?
'Strapped?'
Coke?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Here they are, then.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
You know my pager number?
We're going to New York?
She poured it for --
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Bet you like that shit.
Is your papa West Indian?
Yes, sir.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Daddy, where's my money?
What you talking?
Take it easy, baby.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
What did you give it to me for then?
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
What for?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
I can't make out that shit.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
Do you?
I'll have it tomorrow.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
What?
What?
I can handle it.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
What have you set your mind to?
Yes.
It won't be easy.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Get some sleep.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I'm tired of praying.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Sure, man.
Say what you're saying.
She know?
The sentences to run concurrently.
Let's go.
How long has this been going on?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
That ain't bad.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be all right.
Head nigger in charge?
Who the hell are they?
Yes sir.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
A lot of people are looking for you.
So where do we begin?
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
Were you provided with a gun?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Is it loaded?
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
You mean a misfire?
Yes or no?
If they like me.
Hmmm?
And don't start crying.
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I know you're not.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Dyslexic?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Bye, Mom.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
She likes him.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
That's ridiculous.
It will be a hard break.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I feel fine.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Who?
It's her baby too, you know.
Well, it ain't your baby.
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Marty.
Were the lights on?
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
That's the one.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
It's loaded with what?
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You gonna die without a son.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
You not ugly.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
What do you want me to do?
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
Yes, O'Reilly?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Y'all mind the store.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
People will talk.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
I was just asking...
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I don't feel anything.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
But I'm married.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
You're asking for somebody else?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Why would he do that?
It was really nice of you to take me along.
I didn't have much choice.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
About that chest-cutter...
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Never mind.
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
With all of it?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
The letter from John Doe.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
You made it up.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
In what man!
John Doe.
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
Who, for instance?
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Well, maybe you're right.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Yeah, a little.
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Sure. Mostly often.
You don't have to—Why, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
It must be some kind of a gag.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Sure.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
What difference does that make?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
It's good to see you. Sit down.
It's for Ann . . .
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Are you in charge, Roper?
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I know.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
National Marksman Competition.
How are we gonna get him out of there?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
The 6 horse is still last.
What the fuck is going on.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Greg.
What do you want from me?
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Scottie, Scottie...
Scottie?
A deeper level?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Stay up there, Girl...
What?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What do you think would be in order?
And a car.
The car is part of the deal.
Roper...
What have you promised them?
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
Because I took it out of your memory.
You were right.
What's happening?
You are not a God.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Unfinished business.
New York.
He had keys.
Two maze runners.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Realize?
Just like that?
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
Where did it originate?
I see... a fox
What's a Triac?
... Nothing.
NEW POWER COINS!!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
It's... an eagle?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
What is THAT!
How the heck?!...
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
So what happened?
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Bastard didn't even show.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
The deal's too good, Frankie
Same here.
It's too late.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
You boys carryin' pieces?
He's trying to make it.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
What about the share.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Where's the stiff?
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
<u>Why</u>??
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Why?
Holy shit.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Land of Death. How do I get there?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Mother, I ...
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
What dame?
Paine.
Oh--yeah--
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
Have *you*?
Where?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
A dirty frame!
Where were you?
Nonsense, Jeff.
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Yield *how*, sir?
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
How's Amos, Ma?
What's your name?
Is--is something the matter?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Calendar?
What's that?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Thanks very much.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
He did?
Yes, yes--
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Have you always had to--work?
Since sixteen or so.
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
It *is* not!
No!
No--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Already? All these letters?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Hello.
But--I've done everything I--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
How's that, buddy?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Just a minute, Joe!
Senator Paine.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Are these the articles?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Uh-huh.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
He played in the town band, too.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Are you? When?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Good night.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Had the boys follow us.
When're you going to see him again?
Boy, was he burning.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Yes, but you said—
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
How is this, sir?
Perfect! Perfect!
Thank heaven.
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Wants to know who the heir is.
Yes.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
What kind of wife did you say she was?
A child? My uncle's?
Huh?
No.
A what?
Uh-huh.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
What do you think you're doing?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Doubtful. What did he say?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Ernest, what do you think?
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Go to hell.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I've had my moments.
What do you do?
I'm sorry, your honor.
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
Yeah.
Where am I supposed to eat?
He told you.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Finally, some common sense...
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is she against you getting help?
I've offended you!
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
It's all right.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
You're upset.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I'm glad.
What was that?
I guess you saw the show...?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
You got off easy.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
That's not quite what I said --
No again?
How are you?
Can I ask you a personal question?
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
This is exactly what I wanted.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Amazing.
What?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
I can tell you anything else.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Yes... your particular approach.
You know where he's taking her?
Oh yes, of course.
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Goin' somewhere?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Immune from what?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
You bastards!
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
So who's the broad?
I just decked your brother
You swear?
What did you find? What did you see?
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
We're almost there.
How?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
Is he supposed to look like that?
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Got guts, lady.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
You lied to me!
What do you suppose killed him?
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
So who killed him?
Atta, girl!
No one will believe us.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Against.
I'd better go.
Date?
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
You're the Sphinx.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
But she still might call!
So why don't you just tell her!
Or flowers.
The who?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Wow.
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
What do you mean?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Are you serious?
About 5,000 troops.
Any cannon?
Yes, sire?
Come back in an hour.
I haven't been there for three years.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Why are you carrying the dog?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
No... nothing at all.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
When is she supposed to return?
Ah, that is good.
One had better legs.
She must have been in love with you.
Promise me you will never leave me.
I cannot promise you that.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Yes -- what is it?
Five minutes.
But you will not... be safe...
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
You wrote it.
My God, what do you think?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Yes, I do -- very much.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Anything you need.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I can't taste nothing.
What?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
What's the matter?
I ain't trying to get in it.
You go first.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Why didn't she put'em out?
I did.  Is that door locked?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
You alright?
Delivery!
Here I come!
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
I do.
I got fired too.
Tape his mouth shut.
Debo!  Debo!
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, what's going on?
My back.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
I threw my back, again.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
What?
Where'd you come from?
San Diego.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
I...
Who did?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Come with us, sir.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
What about the gun?
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
You know what I'm gonna do.
Is that something precious?
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
I think you better put that away.
On TV.
No way.
Ready?
All right.
Will you promise me that?
It's a twenty.
Cover your mouth.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Oh, Jesus ...
Then why'd you drag me into it?
I don't know.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Gimme a dollar.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Why?
Foreigners! Fuck!
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
What gives?
No.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
No.
She went.
How do you mean?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Bluebeard!
Tricked us!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Tell me a story, John.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
Pearl! You ain't --
It's all here.
Story, honey? Why, what story?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Yes?
What's your name?
About our secrets.
No.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Can I have this?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
What do you figure to do?
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Them kids is yours?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
When did I ever?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
Worked like a charm.
Because he was scary, that's why.
You okay?
Haven't slept, have you?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
My dream.
What?
Hello Nancy.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
She lived there.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Give me the key, mother.
Do you think I did it?
No more fights.
Good evening, Anna.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Well, a hat...
An evening gown.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You want this?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
And if we have to go to Siberia...
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
A day.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
We did our best, Comrade.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
Yes, Comrade.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
...and Kopalski.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
Give me another double brandy.
You want me to go in there?
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
So that is your house?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Yes.
He takes good care of that.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
Don't do it, please.
Wounded? How?
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Do you hear that?
Then do it through my lawyer!
I didn't follow you.
Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Why?
At what?
Because we are an odd couple.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Anything, Ninotchka.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
You must, darling.
Comrades! Good people of France!
All right, we'll make it red.
Radio! What is radio?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Oh, yes.
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Yes, Swana.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
That's all right... I grow on people.
I must ask you to leave.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
What do you want?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
May I ask why?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Where to, madame?
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
We'll see about that ...
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Executive clemency ...
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
Is it?
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
You do it.
Why me?
How so?
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Pay him.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Sorry ...
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
Sir, the deadline is today.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Fucking hell.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
You never told him?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Because they're not Americans.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
How?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Yes, Mother ...
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
What about happiness, Mother?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
... little Bobby.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
We took his system out.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Why, you got a customer?
The White House.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
So, what's this about, Dick?
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
I beg your pardon --
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
That was Mr. Kennedy.
He was a politician.
Why?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Ernie Davis.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Sir?
Yes, yes.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Can I just ask for one thing?
He looked old, didn't he?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
Tomorrow.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Don't be ridiculous!
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
'Predate it.
In Angola. Yeah.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Yes, you've circled round.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
When did he die?
I'm... discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No ID in her room?
Uh-huh.
Hard to believe.
Nothin'?
Would you tell me if you had?
It could be.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Yes sir.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
I never do.
Okay.
What's in the satchel?
Llewelyn.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Llewelyn?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Where does he work?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Huh? What is...
How'd you find it?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
With anything?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Uh-huh.
I want you to take me to another motel.
November the 28th, last year.
Okay. We can stop that.
Could I get another room.
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
It's called a transponder.
...What do you do?
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
Nam?
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
They're fine... you miss it?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
...I... I know what you are.
That's my son! My son is dead!
I'm sorry.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Umm... yes. Back home.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
The LeSabre!
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, you mean Fred.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Sure you don't want any salad?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Yes.
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
The one you were telling me about?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
He has a wife?!
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Doctor David Ravell.
What are those for?
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
You should have a little faith in people.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Should I kill him now?
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
What?
I never said that I believed...
Wesley...
It just didn't fit her profile...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Oh, five years, give or take.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I said I'll think about it.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
In any state.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Suckin' away.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
I been calling for four months.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
I want your D.O.R.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
You're good.
I didn't call you anything before that.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Yes, sir!
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Really?
Do you go to school?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
There's always a choice.
Be a friend. Leave.
You're better than candy.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
That was great.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Hi.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
So?
Why?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I can't risk it.
He said he grew up poor?
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Open it.
Can we come in?
A what?
Watch your mouth.
Cut it back a little bit.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
We're leaving.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
478...
It doesn't work?!
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Fuck.
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Morse code?
He --
I was trying not to tell you...
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Where is the Glucogen?
Those ain't cops.
Well... is it loaded?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Yeah... whatever you say.
Get out of the car.
Yeah, it's me.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
I don't know. Look around man.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
You were. infantry right?
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
I saw... but...
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
Just a kid.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Fuck is up?!
What are you saying?
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
Where is he?.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
You believe that?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
Late summer.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Well?
I know him well enough?
You got salt last week.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
I consider them linked.
What news?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
How old are you?
These four wagons must be his.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
That's right.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
He left us.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
You don't hate him.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
Name five hundred.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
That bad?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Father?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yes.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
Was it Pascow?
Allman Brothers.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
What did we do, Jud?
Wouldn't wash?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
What?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
Well, honey...you know that...
Thank you, Louis.
You stole my boat.
How does he do that?
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
I'll watch my back.
No, I really think I do.
Why don't I want to do this?
That so?
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Man overboard!
You're speaking up for him again?
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Then I can wear men's clothing.
What?
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
Miss Swann.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
First -- have you found me a crew?
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
A fool's errand.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
We're not going to just surrender!
What's your name?
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
You cheated.
Why ask me?
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
I think he's telling the truth.
He may be.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Commodore --
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Like rotting meat.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Then you still love me?
Icarus?
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Hey!
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
You were never invited to my house.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Yes?
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
Three days ago it was.
That's right.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
The nanobot... it's not here...
That's pretty good.
You saved my life.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Where did you get those letters?
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
You wear them of course, silly.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Are you crazy?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
That's ridiculous.
You're acting like a child.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Is that so?
All right, all right, don't mention it.
How's that?
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Come on, get going, get going!
Not on my own beat, no.
A what?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
I'm not quitting!
No!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Oh no, sir!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
That's a lovely dress.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Right.
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
A statement? Good.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
No, sir!
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
... Sex.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
And they won't be able to tell?
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Bud?
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Where are you gonna go?
Really Biff? The keenest?
... Lover's Lane.
Sure is pretty.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
It's six-thirty ...
I don't believe it.
She won't go out with me?
Want some bridge mix?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
It was accessible to everyone.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
It's not in ME.
And where's that?
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Lemme see that.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
No way.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
Yeah ...
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
No. I baked them for you.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Mmmmgh.
What do we do?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
Yeah ...
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
... Hi.
I had nothing to do with that.
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Yes.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Forget about that!
You know what I really like?
... What's that?
Really?
Yeah.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
Hello.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
What?
Goodbye.
Hey. What are you doing?
You're so scared.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Nothing.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
It doesn't matter.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Georgia.
Not very late.
Yes.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
....what....?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
There's a piano in the street.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Business is good, you're busy?
I saw a picture of you.
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
Sure.
Yeah.
....yeah....
There's a better place for us to eat.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
...yes I did...?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
I don't know.
Hi.
Really?
Ok.
Lena?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Where do you have to go?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Yeah.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
The police are on their way.
And your name?
What's that for?
It's ok, take your time.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Fine, thank you.
I'm sorry.
So what should I do with the pudding?
WHICH?
Yes.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
Yes. Sorry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll go pay for my car.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
So...did my brother call you?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Yes, Abbe?
Has he hurt you?
By whom? The Marquis?
Why not?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
Good day, Marquis.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
A man after my own heart...
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
It's no secret that you loved her.
-- that was lust --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
Was it impotence?
I'm here.
Of course.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
You're a sentimental man.
Well?
It was not inspired by circumstance.
That's not our intent --
I'll do everything in my power --
He'll do no such thing.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Here it is; the last chapter.
Did I frighten you?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
What have they done to you now?
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.
That poor woman.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
My name is Orson Welles
So I've been told.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
There. That's right.
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I want blood
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Fuck you
I don't have it anymore?!
It's good, huh?
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
You gonna watch?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Oh God.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
You talked to New York?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Yes!
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Sure. What is it?
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Nah, she would never...
What do you mean?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
What?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Three more, I figure.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Take off my pants.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
No, I'm not.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
What did I do?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Jake, no --
With Salvy, eh?
What?
Then what?
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
What are you doing?
How's the weight? Ok?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Thanks.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can't do that.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
But I'm not a killer!
Jefferies.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Your Lisa?
Where'd they take Lisa?
For what?
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
That's normal.
Stella!
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
I was.
What are you two talking about?
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
How much do you think you'll need?
What about the rest?
Hello.
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
For what?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Of course not.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Homework. It's more interesting.
What do you think?
Lisa, please!
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
That's what the witnesses told him.
That's a suitcase?
From his landlord -- once a month.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Your name?
Steady Marlon!
What's happening?
Machismo?
Yeah.
Any other entrance?
What's he going to pull--
You still want to go home, Moose?
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Yeah!
Yes.
What would you do, Dad?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Will you wait a minute?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
He's home.  I heard the car.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Boy!
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
We know.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Come out come out wherever you are!
There's only one key.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Just a guard.
What?
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Do I have to spell it out?
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
What?
If he could--
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Won't mother be proud.
You still pretty upset?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
I don't know.
What?
No!
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Plato, where's your father now?
Hi, Plato!
What?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
What?
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Radio said negative five.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Saw me --
Do that again.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
You need a COAT!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
You saved me.
They'll have guns.
I'm almost done.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You what...
Where's she work?
What?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What'd they call her in high school?
Bam Bam.
What's her greatest fear?
Christmas... Eve...
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
What about the Powwow Safe?
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Not yet.
I'm just talking.
Oh.
What, working security?
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
GUARD! GUARD!
Jesus, Rudy --
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
How'd you know I'd do it.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
You gave them me.
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
How ya doin', Toothpick?
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
I'll call somebody.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Bullshit.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Didja use the commode story?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
What for?
He don't tip.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Why?
For what, the cops?
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Joe.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Lie back down, and try to -
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I'm cool.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Like what?
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
But the rest is right.
It's going to Sonora.
How does she draw?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
What did you come back for?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
I can't take her with me.
I don't care.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Go away -- please.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
They shouldn't have done that.
Goodbye and thanks.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
Where is he?
We got to get movin'.
Would you like to learn them?
Then I know my alphabet.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
You were supposed to be reading words.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Help!
Cindy, what's going on?
Where's Shorty?
No. I never date outside my race.
What about you, Buddy?
Can you feel that?
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
So, whatever happened to her?
I'm Cindy.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
What the hell are you doing?
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Am I cool now?
What are you getting at, Professor?
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Let me see the files.
Here you go, Professor.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
What?
That's why we came here, remember?
What are you working on?
And sexy.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
You never could feel your legs.
How is she?
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Yes.
Because she will lie?
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
I certainly did.
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
I beg your pardon?
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
And who may I ask is Carl?
It's him!
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
He's a good boy.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Man, that one made me puke!
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
We can't stand here all night.
About forty-five dollars.
Hello, Frances.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
I did her hair.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
But I'm not joking.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
Well?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
She'll have to know some time.
Why wait?
You'll be all right?
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
What a peculiar question.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
She's not been here for a long time.
But she was here?
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Because I have something very important to do.
What?
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
That was quick.
Have you ever been on television?
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Oh, uh-huh.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Impotent.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Videotapes.
What kind of personal project?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
You just ask them questions?
And they just answer them?
I know.
Why not?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
No.
On tape?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
God, I m so mad at him!!
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Something wrong?
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I want out of this marriage.
Where did you go when you left here?
Goddam right.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Yeah, I know.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Is he still at your house?
What?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
What are you talking about?
Lose something?
Then why'd you call me?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
I wanted him to see me.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
She didn't give you my address?
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Nothing.
You just want to ask me questions?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Prettier than Ann?
No.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
You're intrigued?
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
When?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Student?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Everybody has a past.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
You were prying before?
I like having the car, the car is important.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
May I ask who's calling?
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Anything wrong?
But where are you going?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Good shape for an old man, eh?
That you, Rog?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
Huh?
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
About Brad's family?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
I'll leave you young things to it.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
Mental instability?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
YOUNG BLOOD
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
I'm...happy.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
Me?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Brad!
BRAD!
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
And none of them worked?
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Bye.
Huh.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Bottle.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Hiya.
Highliner, please.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
What?
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Perfect.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
She what?  When?
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Get the trunk.
Pull yourself together, man.
Bathroom.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Where is Stephanie?
What? Of course I like Christine.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Fucker hit into us.
I don't want to talk about it.
Is what the money thing?
What's happening?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Hrnrnrn?
Love you, man.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
I'm having the salmon.
Hi.
Hey.
Yeah, I know.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Good. So did I.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Okay.
Were you ever going to say anything?
Oh, Maya. No.
Where are you?
Ken.
I am.
Should we get dessert?
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Only for pee or poop.
No.
There's dust in it.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
The same windows.
I don't feel much.
...I will.
I'm here.
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
How do they know it's over?
Have they said anything about our area?
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
It's the strangest thing Father.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
And three weeks.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Why not?
Don't do it!
What book!
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
You'll never make it.
Paden sends his best.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
I understand.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
Where you been?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law?
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
We didn't get that far.
This a friend of yours?
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Hello, Rae.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
What about his brother?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
I took out thirteen dollars.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Nifty.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
So-called?
Why'd you go into business with him?
Is this a fair mix?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
I'm glad we talked.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- What's wrong with that?
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- It's called a projector.
Spare me.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Why isn't she with you?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
I'll send you her resume.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Even the fall from the plane.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Everyone you know is lying.
Viktor, you should have said something.
She said you were very beautiful.
Excuse me?  Start?
Hello?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
For her?
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
-- We call them "vactors".
-- Flesh is weak.
"Straw God" changed my life.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
I know plenty of boys.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
You mean they buy it?
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Are you calling me?
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
What were they hiding from?
You use needles?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Know what?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
What kind of words?
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
What?
Yes?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
Don't get mad.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
They did?
Cole, you're scaring me.
They want me to do things for them.
Like what?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Good for you.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
I happen to be a professional.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
Should we be doing this, dude?
"And a slash-slash there --"
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
Sure. What do you want to know.
-- It's not me!
It's time to make amends.
Ow!
Who? Us?!
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Name something.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Look. You want to talk about this?
Suzie... No.
It's you. You and your father.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
What is it?!!
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like your guitar break.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
Sorry.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
How about Brenda?
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
That wasn't a good night, no.
What are you doing?!
Shelby --
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Hey there, Chief.
Sure thing, killer.
It's just a work thing.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Flip.
Grant, no!
Get your hands off my daughter!
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
A what?
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
My very words.
Why should I?
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
What's your pleasure?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Or in the slammer.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Bandit?
Yeah?
Hit the brakes!
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I ran into complications.
We're gone.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
I'm here.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Yeah, but...
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Go breaker.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Yes, ma'am.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
Five thou.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Damn... alright then.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
No, what did you say on the machine?
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
...Yeah, fifty-three.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
What's wrong?
What do you want?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
No, she won't.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Where's Sartorius?
Who was it?
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
What will you say?
To who?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
When did this happen?
I wasn't.
You go home.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
Rheya.
Do you?
It's all right.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Rheya --
You should have told me.
Neither did I.
Chris --
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Yes, you are --
I wish you wouldn't.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
When?
He won't do it.
You want it coming back with us?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I'll come with you.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
I do care about you!
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
It wouldn't work.
... Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Mike?
What are you talking about?
Get in bed.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I think -- she's crazy.
I'd identify him.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Coming to bed?
What?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
I just sat and listened.
Even Joey Venza?!
What about when she identifies him?!
Watch your step!
Sexual tension...
No, no.
Harry…
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Are you okay?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Would you cool it already?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Thanks, I already ate.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Some things you should say anyway.
I hate--
But you like that in a man?
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
A match made in heaven.
Poison emergency.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Jawohl!
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Break it off!
How did he get over there?
Twenty-five.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
What exactly is he charged with?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Stop it, Harry!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
How do they know?
You off your rocker?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
December seventh, forty-one.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Is it all right if we smell it?
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Data, are you all right?
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
All of us.
We don't have a tractor beam.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
You could say that.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
The Nexus.
Trilithium?
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Nothing. As before.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Why don't we beam it up?
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
... Fascinating.
Underground deposit?
This planet is aging in surges.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
How many more?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
What? What are you saying?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
The ship... Out of danger...?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.

Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
Yes... But -- how...?
What must I do?
Sir, may I suggest --
How can you tell that?
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
And who am I hiding from?
Shore leave, Admiral.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
I told you! I told you I saw a --
But the child --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Is that what you came here to say?
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're still running with shields down.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
And who is this?
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
A distinct possibility.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
How?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
All stop, sir.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
You do this -- for friendship?
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
We've done it before.
... My shoes...
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
We're just -- observing.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
Can you protect us?
Attempting the hell to communicate.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
You're upset about losing the whales.
So. There we are.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Here... In the park?
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
But you said toxic.
Yes.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
I see.
I cannot tell a lie.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Aye, sir. Descending.
Systems report.  Communications?
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Admiral! There be whales here!
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Well, that's different.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Sulu Hikaru.
Why?
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
... an offlander?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
There are caves in those mountains.
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Chase me!
Are they in any danger?
Yes... that looks like them.
A ship,
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
Understood.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Do you know how they were damaged?
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
... had regenerated.
Full impulse.
If it works you mean.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Why would we be involved with these people?
You haven't done that in a long time...
Why don't you try sitting up?
... I believe you...
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
No. I will not betray my friends.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
I believe so.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Juice?
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Ready to make a little history?
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
The invasion plans.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
I can try.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Just a little queasy...
Even Data?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
I didn't mean this future.
Still think we're finished?
If they're even looking for us...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
Retire.
Barely.
I was nervous -
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
You feign ignorance?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Are those your words?
Yes...
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Where IS the conference?
Shields. Battle stations.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Do we report this, sir?
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Me?
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
What the -
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Close enough to beam down?
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
How did you - ?
I don't want to.
Direct hit -
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
That could take hours!
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
When was he... created?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
That was another time.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Yes.
It's you.
No.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
This isn't real.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
Not with the Romulans.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Were we always explorers?
What are you doing?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off.
What's this all about?
Why are you here?
And what of the Enterprise?
Long ago.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I don't know.
I am.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
What about Picard?
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
I understand.
What do you think of America?
Where did you stop last?
Recognize this?
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
When can we expect containment?
It's taken on a disguise.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
No, we don't.
No deal.
Please...
Gear shift.
Smile... good?
Go.
I am husband?
Why are you going here? What is here?
Yes.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
Say it.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
What is hell?
Yes.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
They are beautiful.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I love you.
Tell the baby about me.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Hey, fuck you, man.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
You have to go.  I mean it.
He has his uses too.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Can't do it.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Faith OK?
Where's Faith?
Jesus!
So there never was a death squad.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
What?
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Nero.
What's his name?
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
She still loves me.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
What is it?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
What is it?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Shit!
Those two guys were cops.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
It was a tough call.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Alright.  We're going up.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
What is that?
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Anybody talk to the press?
You run the plates?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
You're thinking...?
You tell me.
Dylan here.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
You're a... you're sick.
What did he look like?
He was sitting here?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Huh?, sir.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Miss me, Dave?
Don't you touch him.
How long have you been downtown?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
And one other thing.
What's that?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
There are Agency regulations about this.
The tattoo?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Tom, you okay?
You okay?
Suspect Zero?
Zero killed them all?
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
But why attack an Agent?
350 miles.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Just like that?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
It does.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
...And she's with someone else.
Sorry?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
Yeah. And an actor.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...Which one...?
So what's the difference?
Right.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
I didn't want to say anything.
Why?
Oh no?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
You want to talk about it?
Well, you're doing so well...
I didn't make it...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
That was so demeaning...
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
...gotta...
Oh... a Dorothy.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
I gotta use the phone.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
I don't think so.
Don't remind me.
Which one?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
She didn't see.
What a surprise.
Tomorrow?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
...double diamond...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
What do you wish me to do?
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
What percentages for my family?
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
This morning.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
What is this nonsense?
And this?
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Things went badly in Palermo?
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
We should hear what they have to say.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
What about McCluskey?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
How can you be sure?
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Where are you going?
We're going to New Jersey?
Thanks.
Buy me out?...
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You straightened my brother out?
Yeah.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
What? What?
Okay, darling.
Who's this?
I'm intruding.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
This is so good of you.
You're breaking my ribs!
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
What does he say?
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Shoes too?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
He's downstairs.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
How?
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Dickie?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
I guess.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Very.
Tom?
You've got Dickie's rings.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Marge? Where are you going?
What's funny?
As in the...?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
So -- are you travelling under R?
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
I've been backpacking.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even her.
November, I thought.
November 7th is my information.
It is a little coarse, yes.
I have!
You got a .44 Magnum?
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
You like ball games?
Who mam?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Yes?
Really?
What did you do?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Where are you going?
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Have you been noticing anything strange?
No, why?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
With the other hand, right?
Could you see anything?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
You carry a piece? You need one?
Hello.
Well... I guess so.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
No.
I don't remember.
Why not?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
How?
What do you mean?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
You want to work uptown nights?
Some. Here and there.
You moonlightin?
Is that so?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
Wha -- ?
Yeah?
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Spit it out.
Limp dick?
What, vou?
Partners?
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
I believe you.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
You'll stand by me?
You've got everything?
Did you bring along something to read?
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Do you... remember me?
Why me?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
When did you start smoking?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Thanks.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
I do.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
What's that?
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Yes?
But I...
Yes.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
She's very pretty.
Evening, Luke.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Huh?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
I was decorated.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
It's wrong, Leo.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
That was beautiful.
Sit.  Play with me.
What?
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
The war...
You hungry, son?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Yes?
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Because she was afraid.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Yes.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
I know.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
I wonder if you could help me.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yep.
I see. How do I get down there?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Thank you.
Yes.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Yes, Mother.
I know, Mother.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Mother, get a rope!
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Then he saw.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Yes.
I couldn't ask you to.
That's the last of it.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Monday?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Are they moulting now?
I didn't break that window!
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
You like me, huh?
Seven o'clock then.
Famished.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No.
I'd still like to see you.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Helping travelers.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
And Fridays? What do you do then?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
It smelled of the fire.
Do you want to try your father again? 
Santa Rosa?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
What were the crows after at the school?
For what purpose?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Birds?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Of course.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I fear he may have to.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
But this woman -- and her son --
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Gray killed her.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
See that, Fettes?
You've no thought of going there?
I thought this was a school day.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Yes, Doctor.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
You've been with Gray again.
Where are they? Last chance.
I'm looking for my friends.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Tell her... we'll get him.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
The strip joint?
Fuck! What do you want?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
You're him. Corvis.
Your father gave them to both of you.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
This tree. Here's where it happened.
My father.
... it connects you to me...
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
Erin!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Such power exists?
Professor Barnhardt.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Tell me what?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
He gave these to you?
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
All right.
How does he explain that?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
The present situation?
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
I can judge only by what I see.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
Hello--
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
How do you know?
I don't know how to thank you.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Just twelve.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I'm sorry.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
All together?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Honda 250, huh?
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
We were gonna grab some food.
Where is she?!
For a ride.
Leave him alone.
You can't kill me, Star.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Of course not!
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Did we have a date tonight?
Who, Laddie?
No.  Just you.
I like Michael.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Ohmygod...
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Not impressed, are you?
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Does it burn?
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
David's looking for me... I have to go.
It's gone.  I feel it!
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What would that make Mom?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
What was he doing in the rec room?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Watch Clark.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Cut him loose?
What's happening?
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Would that test have worked?
Now hold him.
Nothing we can do about that.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
You reach anybody yet?
He might just wait us out.
What about Childs?
The generator!
What's happened?!
MacReady, that you?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
But you're only a mud carrier.
What are you?
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
It's what they want you to see.
Yes.
Alexander.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
How?
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
What?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Now will you go?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
Got here as soon as I could.
You know I can't.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Alex, what is it?
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
You wouldn't believe me.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
You won't say that in a week.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Every night.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
What's it all for?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Did you have fires at night?
So you can use it now?
Kalen...
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
I see.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
No...
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
We never should have done this to him...
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I don't give a shit about your patient!
My business?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Do I know you from somewhere?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
I need to get this letter to someone.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
You two ok?
You're just gonna walk?
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
I have no idea.
I don't know.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
They're not here.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
And if I didn't want to come?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
It doesn't look all that different.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
What are you talking about?
Don't you go to jail for that?
What were you talking about the other day?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Have a good day at work today.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
How are things goin' out there?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
What kind of gun was it?
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
How?
I always knew that.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Call me back.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Front.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Which part?
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Yes.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Give me the keys.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
That's puttin' it mildly.
You're disturbed.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
I want you to call Darryl.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Louise?  Where are we?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
What?
Ready?
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
You do?
You know why.  You already said.
Good.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
What?!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Say you're sorry.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Stop it!
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I don't know about this, Dom.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Well then you've got to call her, man.
I am?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Mints?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Stalker, huh?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
You own a home there?
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
Have you seen it?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
No.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
I think your life's about to change.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
So she's married?
Huh?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Harvard?
Kim and I are close friends!
What do you mean?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Why?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Holy shit...
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Can I pour you one?
Oh yeah. Fine.
Are you all right?
Really? I never got a message.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
It.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
Tomorrow...
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
What does the letter say?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
The sun came up today.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
What's happened?
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
How's my favorite President?
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Hey, sport. You winning?
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
What's that?
Rug samples.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
A murder. On the reservation.
What are you doing?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
Maisy Blue Legs place?
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Tread matches. It's the car.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Why?
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Crow Horse, listen --
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
What?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
You're the Indian FBI.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Good.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
I'll bet!
That's a big comfort to me.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
It's what?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
You let me make a fool of myself.
The what?
Harmless!
What if he's not?
What about the plane?
Used to what?
Let's make it at eight.
It's not suffering anymore.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
You want to go ballistic?
In that order?
. Yeah!
Lucky charm.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Not to me.
Do what, show you a good time?
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
You don't believe that.
It does.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Can't shake him.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
Saving them some paperwork.
Okay, okay.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Is it you?
Well what?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
On what?
Did what?
Got you here.
That's not what I heard.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
So's my Johnson.
What are you doing?
3000 feet. I'll do it.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I guess I owe you one.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
I've seen this before.
Who's the hell is that?
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Why?
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
I can take care of myself.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
What do you want?
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Why not?
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Amazing.  Where are we?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
You went to Rekall, remember?
Where?
Are you saying she liked it?
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
Look at this shit.
Nobody.
Let me go!
Just think about it.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
Clever girl.
I love you.
Nice to meet you.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I'm not interested in that.
I love you.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
Blondes.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Don't be ridiculous.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Darn it!
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Don't hurt him.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
You can't remember that -- !
How can you remember that?
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Of course.
I specialize, Roger...
Where?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Do you have to do that?
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
But what?
I'm not that desperate.
...Jesus!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
-- Find him?
You do.
Want to tell me what went down here?
I killed the motherfucker.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
See-cil.
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
Five years.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Soldado.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Was there an argument?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
You try that you little monkey.
OK, Gordon.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
No.
Shorthand. Really?
How do you figure?
Are you speaking to me in a code?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
James called me last night looking for you.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
I don't know what to do.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Maybe.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Donna, are you my best friend?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Do you want to talk?
If I can smoke it.
You want a muffin?
Laura, I am your friend.
WE got it back, that's all.
I can't help you there.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
James...
Boating?
Sex?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
What were you doing in my room?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Dad.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Dad...
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Are you sure you're okay?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
As if I didn't know.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
You're right. There's no one here.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
I'm fine.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
This is going to drive the ante up.
It's a crime.
I...
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
I do. Yes.
I thought I would need it.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
Objection, we've...
Yes!
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
Hold on a second.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
The Doctors were not negligent.
Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am on the staff of...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
I read the hospital report on your client.
Right. Who called?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes.
Yes.
A single hour.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
What?
Overruled...
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
And are they going to get it?
I've got to work.
Do you think it's my fault?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Who told you that?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You know what happened.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Well, well, well. Huh?
Yeah.
...I have to stand up for her...
How are you holding up?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
What the hell are you doing here?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
Yes.
...of the procedures...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Should I?
Yes.
Is that it over there?
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
How'd you guess?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Just be careful, okay?
Chase, you'd better come home.
Yes.
No.
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
I want my kid out of here now!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
Your bed?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Heather Langenkamp?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
It can be captured, sometimes.
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Me?  Why me?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
What?
You may not like what you hear.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Can we talk?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
No, I didn't.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Do you have your ticket?
Good.
Forget it.
No way!
My parents don't do it anymore.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
It has nothing to do with him.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
We'll think of something.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
They tell you that?
What?
It hurts too much to care.
How long you been standing there?
What are we supposed to talk about?
No.
What's that supposed to mean?!
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
What is it?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
No shit?!?! You know him?
What's the name of it?
You hitched yet?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
Hasta siempre.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
What?
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
And?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Here she goes again...
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
What's that honey?
That don't seem fair.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
You mean like pedal pushers?
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
What's that, peanut?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
I do.
What was this one?
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
You're scarin' me, baby.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
They have, sugar.
Trust me on it.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Love you, too.
Let's leave here.
I mean tomorrow.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
I'll bet.
Damn!
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Santos... I can't...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
By who?
So I hear.
Your wife.
I just mean...
He said something about being between things.
She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
No. Not yet he isn't.
Not Curtis.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
That was good.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
The Chancellor's here? Now?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Such as.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
How long have you been having them?
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Better luck next time.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
No! What gave you that idea?
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Really? That's remarkable.
Yea, James.
Can I ask you something about her?
What'd he say?
So where have you been staying?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
I just wanted a little sip.
So, why did you take me up there?
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
It's because you don't eat.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Professor Tripp...?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
That good, huh?
New?
All right. This morning --
I'm sure.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Who's gun is that?
You heard? How?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Really? That was fast.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
Who's that sitting in your car?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
I lost it all.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
I told Walter.
Listen, Antonia --
This is important.
No.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Where you stand?
No, the dog.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Beautiful. How's business?
What?
Annette? She's good... tense.
Cherry.
The birthday party.
Nothing.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Try.
Don't you have friends?
Hiya, Walter.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Fairy tales?
No.
I wasn't feeling well.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
But you are taking it?
Yeah, like the bird.
Robin?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
What?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Of course.
How's that?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
How do you define it?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
Please don't do it again.
When did it all start?
I don't know.
No, I am not going to --
Not so fast.
Where?
We're little kids.
Nothing.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
What else?
It's going to take time, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
What?
You never spoke to me before.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
What?
Why do you want to know?
So?
What?
Do you?
I suffer from insomnia.
It's not what you think.
I never hurt them. Never.
What was prison like?
You okay?
Yeah.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
I can't believe you let them do this!
What about O-2?
Bud, something really important is happening here.
They'll come out after us.
Alright, put this on.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
No, Bud, no... not you.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Why bring it here?
SHIT!
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Then how come you're not with him?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Used to what?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Why are you looking at me like that?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
You say that just to flatter me.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Anything new develop?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
They didn't seem too good.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Through someone else?
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm not hungry.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
Anything... may I sit down?
At least once a week.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Would you like to talk about it?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
I went to my room.
Agnes...
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Are you married?
I've stopped menstruating
You liked Sister Paul?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
What else did she tell you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Like what?
You have trouble sleeping?
Somebody told her.
Agnes...
Do you believe she really saw them?
Yes.
Why not?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Agnes...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
She's dead isn't she?
She can't hurt you any more.
She can.
And that you're stupid?
That you're a mistake?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Yes.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Will she be angry?
I'm afraid.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
A crucifix.
Are you ill?
What do you do?
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
Who?
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Yes.
Why?
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
Of course you do. Who was it?
Yes.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Something they... that they overlooked.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Two packs a day.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Why do you think that?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
And you weren't shocked?
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
Then help her.
There's another choice.
Nothing.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I don't think I care to know.
Oh, dear God.
And my permission?
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Long, thin and filtered.
Pipe!
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
She's been touched by God, yes.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
No!
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Shurrup!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
I'm a deserter.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Ever seen one of these before?
Are you going in?
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
It is, y'know.
Should I say it?
Well, what happened?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
How'd you guess?
Yes.
But that's not like a real person at all.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
What are you?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Yeah ... that's right.
And we're looking after him, are we?
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
Why do you always use your left hand?
Anything to spare?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
That little old man.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Hello.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
It'll only get you into trouble.
He's betrayed the class.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
He's been gone a long time.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
I feel like shit...
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Where's Irth?
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What's up?
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
How do you feel, Dell?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
It's clear.
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Can you do anything for him?
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
This is horrible.
What common objects?
We can use the flamethrower.
First contact...
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
There, it caught!
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
They're on the next level up.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
Where are we?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
Better?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Is it dead?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Picking up velocity.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
What?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What's wrong?
Okay.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Thanks.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
So, what do you think?
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Eddie...
Just like that.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
What time?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
I was there. An eyewitness.
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
Didn't you know?
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Where?
Good luck, genius...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Bill...
And cut that out right now.
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
How is Eve? Okay?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
Nothing, really...
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
It's not nonsense.
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Why what?
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Find out.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
She works hard.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
What report? To whom?
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Try...
Not just that way. As a friend...
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
I think I know...
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
You talk just as Addison said you did.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
How'd hear about it?
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
They're your fans, your audience-
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Harrington.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How much time have we?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Well...
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Lloyd, what happened...?
Margo, again...
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
It's just possible she didn't...
That was a pity...
That's quite a change of subject.
If we could cast it properly, that is...
What's so funny?
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
How about calling it a night?
Where is she?
Don't be evasive.
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
Call, what call?
"Liebestraum."
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
A couple of weeks.
All you got to do is name it.
Are you breaking the contract?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
I said I'm a dying man!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
--fifteen phone calls--
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
Were you eyebrow reading?
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Did he just say what I think he said?
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
What's the matter?
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
I'll never get out of here in time.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Well of course.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
Chapin did contact you then?
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
I think.
Give me your checkbook then.
Hey, easy...
...No... never in so many words...
Who were they?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
What happens when the baby comes?
What's this?
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
They are not my clients.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
...you're definitely doing a story...?
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Howard Hunt here.
--yes, yes, what is it?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
...go on, go on...
Who's Colson, Harry?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Anyone but Bernstein.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--has any of them got an ax?--
More denunciations?
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Mr. Sloan?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Good work, Ostreicher.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Sure.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
All right, I got some scotch.
This is your plan, Finch?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Not bad, Chris.
Why are you doing this?
Onions?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
You mean...and orgasm?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Holy shit.
How do you know that?
Dad!  I know!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Dad!!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Whatever you want.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
She's a mermaid, dude.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
After getting laid?
What's up, fellas?
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Yes.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Move with the music.
Ho-lee shit.
Vicky, wait.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
You want to do it?
But you don't love me.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Kevin, it was just a --
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
Are you crazy!?
We don't both have to die.
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
Nothing's happening!
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
What?
Where is it! Please!
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Why would he pick this one?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
You fucking liar!
What've you got?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
No! I look ridiculous!
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
I'm sorry.
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
No. Empress, you --
You are the boy ...
Promise me she'll have her home.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Singer!
Why not?
We've been through this.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
The alarm clock.
Alvy, I...
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
All right.
Oh, right.
Nice car.
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Oh, you see an analyst?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
No, so help me.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay?
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Yeah.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Those are the two categories...
Oh, yeah?
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
What'd I do?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
My head is throbbing.
I have a headache.
Bad?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
It's a narrow view.
Oh.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Ah, Max, you, uh...
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Forget it, Max.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
What's the matter?
You all right?
There are no twos, Max.
M'hm.
You fired the cleaning woman?
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Hey-
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
It's the way they do things.
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Why didn't you come in?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
No, what?
What?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
What what's about?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
What?
Oh.
Well, probably.
I'd say it was down.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Thanks for coming.
He's not going tonight.
When does he graduate high school?
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
And?
Monica.
And you know our friends, how?
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
There's still time to undo this.
You're out of your mind.
Take your time, Jer.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Okay, knock it off.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
Love?
It's not like this all the time.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
About me!
I don't look my age, Joe.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Cal, too?
Don't.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Okay.
I know.
Will you make love with me?
We have a gift?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
No.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Yes I did.
Not long.
Don't be silly.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I need to leave you now.
Sorry?
I'm so sorry.
How do you do, Skye?
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
The Shostakovich.
Really??
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
She's all over him, are you blind?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Like your business managers?
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
I never like to talk about my work.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
The both of you.
I trust you.
Oh Soph...
What do you mean, thank God?
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Really?
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Out here I'm just what?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Why do they have you tied up here?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Affirmative.
May I cut in?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
ARREST HIM!
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Ask me why we're so successful.
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
You're a real buddy.
This the place?
Ma'am?
What did I tell you?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Would you like to?
Sure.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
What time does the show go on?
What gave you that idea?
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I forgive you.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
I mean -- her apartment.
Baxter.
What's her first name?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
You sure you want to throw that card?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
In this house, you're supposed to.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Where?
That's terrible.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I never thought he'd do it.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
Yes, sir.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
You left your wife?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Yes, sir.
Naturally.
Don't mind what?
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
I dig.
Now hold on, Baxter --
On account of me.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
What do you want?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
She going to be all right, Doc?
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Aren't you?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Tell me again -- what's my name?
I don't believe you.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
You're not being funny.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
The nerve.
What are you talking about?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
It won't happen again.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
I like all of them --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
How long were you up there ?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Smoke !
What the hell is it?
I --
When'd you do it?
Our Recon flight ?
Touchy.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
How did they know?
No, sir.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
Wh -- what?
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
I got bored in Saigon.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Hairy ?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
Music?
Yeah, I like it...
No water.
How did we get here?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
Both of us...
You're Australian?
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
So that's it.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
23   CONTINUED:
34   CONTINUED:
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
117  CONTINUED:  
...I won't let a killer walk!
How long have you been up north?
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
What are you doing?
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
It's exactly what you meant.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Where's Corbett?
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
You know Meyerling?
I'm here to do my job.
Told you I'm fine!
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Neff, you know better than this...
Alleged killer.
Why the smirk?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Thought that door was open last night...
...Ben never sent a signal.
There's what they're waiting on!
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
How long has he been having problems?
Me. My home number is on this card.
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Oh, please...
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Uh, Udall?
Okay.
I can't. I work.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Thanks, Melvin.
Hey -- you let him...
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
It's one idea...
This one has a special meaning.
I'll take you... why not?
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Uh-huh...
How to die, mostly.
But what about...
No. No. Get Carol.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Oh, my gosh.
Would you leave now, please?
I told you to go on in.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Did you like it that much?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
But you know where you're lucky?
What's wrong?
Is there a problem?
What?
So you're from around here?
What is this?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Tachlinkov.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Oh, yeah.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Deadline?
Yeah.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Why?
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
How?
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
What do you want to know?
Had?
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Because you are a women.
They tried to kill you?
Then you went freelance?
Why?
Are they usually like that?
Do you have a passport?
Good.
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Two way?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Then, we wait.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
We split the money?
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
For Nicholai?
I don't believe that.
What happened?
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
I didn't notice them.
Why?
What are you doing?
What?
Yes.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Okay.
Thank you.
How much farther?
What are you thinking about?
You mean quit?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
How to make a buck!
But we are underground?
Fifteen crowns.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
And put it on expenses?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
I'd love to get in there.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
My God! What happened?
No, the boyfriend.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
And if you're wrong.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
God, I think I need a holiday.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
There shooting at something.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No, I love you, really.
I don't understand, it's your home?
There's nothing there for me.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
About forty minutes.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
This is your doing?
It was the biggest I could find.
Enjoying our hospitality?
We had a deal!
So, he didn't fire you?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
What are you an idiot!
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
So go dance.
Why not?
'Bout what?
To see your father?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
I'm thinking.
Hypotheticals --
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
That's deep --
-- Your act only works with an audience.
It's private.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
You have to believe to have faith.
People can see.
It's a start.
What?
Stand right here.
You make me feel...
Ergo?
You're worried about your college applications.
No.
Can I -- go out?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Yeah.
This is 1952....?
Morning Dick.
Hi, Marty.
What time does school start around here?
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Uh, hi, Eileen.
No, Chinese food is fine.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
You have a name?
What?!
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
How did you know?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Dick? Dick who?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
What did you do to your hair?
Well, he's gone.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
What you been doing?
Don't you ever get bored around here?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
I mean it.
Sure is pretty.
What'd you come out here for?
Is that right?
Yeah? Why not?
Great.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Is that all there is to it?
Think I got 'em?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
No.
That's Montana over there.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Just thinking.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
This is so embarrassing...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Never.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Pick those up, Reno.
Why me?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Please, Barton.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Hello.
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
What DID you mean?
How long you been up there, Fink?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
I beg your pardon?
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I'm a writer. Ted O –
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
He's a great writer –
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
I didn't say anything-
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
And I could tell you some stories –
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
How did you know about that?
Yeah, but –
You're leaving?
Hold on –
You gotta believe me –
Hold on –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
Fink.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Yes sir, they –
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
Transient or resident?
What –
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Is this multiple choice?
All of which he's now missin'.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
He teach you to do it?
So -- how are things?
How is your -- personal life?
I need a cigarette.
Sometimes I really hate you.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
I thought you hardly know her.
Yes.
I don't smoke.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
Did I miss something?
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
What did you pay Nilsen?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
What did you think?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
No?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Was she ever suspect?
I got tired of being played with.
You feeling better?
I don't believe it.
I'm going with you.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
So what do we do -- nothing?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Is this finished yet?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Do you still love her?
What's with the wigs?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Annina Nosei.
You name it, I paint there.
When?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Really?
It's Andy again.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
What's the rush, John Henry?
Good.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
I really... admire you.
Hi.
Come on.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
A what?
You don't have any!!!
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
It's vichyssoise, sir.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
What happened?
Silent night, violent night...
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
It's good to see you.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Oxbridge Academy?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Crimefighter's rule number two.
I was just hanging around.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
Umm-hmmmm.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
Scholarly research?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
The _Rolls_?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
How about, MR. E.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How ya doin', Al?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
I haven't had much luck with women...
Mr...?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
What do you know about obsession?
That kid is amazing.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Find anything interesting?
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
A man with a death wish.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
GET IN THE CAR!!
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Do you sail?
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
Joker here. Can we talk?
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
... Why the mask?
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Hi.....  Roses.
Two dollars please.
Big day today, huh? 78
Oh yes.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
No!
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Bye, Dad.
Sure did.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
It is urgent, sir.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
What a dork. Huh huh.
No it wasn't!
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Me first!
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Butt-snatch...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Beavis.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
...Two...
Talk ta me, Bork.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Where are his pants?
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Cool, huh huh huh.
You'll be rich!
Anything happen while I was away?
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
What's she doing here?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
That little girl saw us.
Of course I did.
Three times.  Powerful number.
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
What about Betelgeuse?
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
I think so.
Three syllables.
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
What do you think, honey?
What?
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
It wasn't a joke.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
You don't have a key?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
... Straight out?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thank you.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
I would like to walk today.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Chauncey...
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
To watch...? To watch me...?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Hello, Sid.
Yes. It's a very good show.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Yes. I am very hungry.
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
I understand.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
I understand.
Certainly, Ben.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
I see.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Good morning, Louise.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
1952...?
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Yes. It has.
Try again.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
It's that gardener!
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
Right, Chief.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Yes, I did.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Yeah.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Is the trial date set?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
She's very beautiful.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Why aren't you at work?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
You fell in love with her first.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
You're insane.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Just.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're evil, Maxine.
Lotte, this is so good...
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Think, Jew florist?
Says who?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
She's not available.
Mr. Malkovich?
I'm getting better all the time.
You mean with Malkovich?
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Well?
Well what?
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YES.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Ya think?
In case of what?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Well, what can you do?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Won't you be late for work?
No...no...no..
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
I run him off.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Leave off..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
All he can. All he can.
No, You looking good.
What? What? You talking back to me?
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Nothing.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Please!  Please!
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Nancy's pretty good.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
No, they--
And what do you do, sir?
Howdy do, Dude.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Oh yeah?
Well--sure, I could do that--
Dieter Hauff?
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Increases?
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
So...that doctor.
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
No, you're not wrong--
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Have it your way.  The point is--
The fucking point is--
What the fuck is going on there?
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Walter--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
But Walter--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Yeah.
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
And the fucking money!
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
Yeah?
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Dude here.
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
'Scuse me?
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Impressive.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What is it with you people and pain?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Blade.
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
Sounds like a plan.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Thought you were dead.
You want me to hunt them for you.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
His name is Jared Nomak.
Any casualties?
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
You should've killed her, then.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
How can you be out here?
I don't buy it.
Who dies first?
Who is LaMagra?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
It worked, didn't it?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
What do you see here?
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I'm not leaving without you.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
You're a week early.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
What happens then?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
Who are you people?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Domini?
Why?
Something was wrong.
Mrs. Leavitt--
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
What'd you dream?
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
What? That made her lose the baby?
Turn the tapes back on.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Okay, a blur.
Can't you like just divine it?
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Yeah?
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
How's she going to know where to--
Okay, but--
How're the cameras doing?
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
--it's less than four feet, just--
Ah, Domini?
Dad...?
--I know!
Okay. Hypothetically.
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
Why?
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
What was that?
Who was it?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
...You ever get tired?
...You all right?
...What?
...You called me this morning.
...What's going on with you two?
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
What did you take these for?
...Count it if you want.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Has Ray come in yet?
Red Label.
Is Marty here?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
To your health, Frank.
Anything you can tell me?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
No. not at all.
Not yet.
Who's this fuck?
Look at these. What are these?
Frank gone?
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Well.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I . I don't know.
No.
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Yeah, it's me.
It's okay. it's okay.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah. but.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
That's what I thought.
You want to go talk to him?
What is it?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
... You look beautiful.
You want to dance?
My father has a gun at home.
Good to see you, son.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
What?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
On the plane.
What is?
Honey, your nose!
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
What?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Diego?  It's George.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Just a friend.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Mexico.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Yes, it is.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
I want money.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
I meant every word of it.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Figured what out?
Do I know you?
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Where are you going?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
I don't believe you.
Because she's visiting me.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Right on.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Sail.
Read it.
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
I think it'll be a success ...
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Take some time off.
What about the will?
About three hours.
The official cause?
A massive cardiac arrest.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Did they argue the day before he died?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
That's ridiculous.
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
No.
A little after eleven.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes.
Why did she say she was leaving?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
Why?
No.
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Yes.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
October twenty-seventh.
I heard him say it.
What changed?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
I've tried it.
I've been to a few -- yes.
No.
Yes.
Then you would have gotten your money?
What do you have in your purse?
Why'd you come here?
Yes.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Something like that.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Can we get out of here?
This is your house.
Hello?
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Sorry.
You and me -- making love.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Can I see you later?
I'm dropping the case.
That wasn't the deal.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
No -- he's lying.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
Humped
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
I don't know.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Mom's orders.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Grateful!?
Was this during Betty?
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh. When did you move back?
After the divorce.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
About a year and a half.
Clean?
And clean.
Feeling better?
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
You ought to write these stories down.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
When?
What?
But it's not the same.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
How about Italy?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I bet you could do a book.
Trouble. Why?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Am I too heavy for you?
Sleep all right?
How do you know what I experience?
WHY?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
What about your husband?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Okay.
What's her name?
About an hour ago.
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Are you nuts?
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
That's what?
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
What else?  Money.
Let me see your hand.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
You know I can't.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Please.  It's for your own good.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
I can't.  Not yet.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
Jimmy Bones?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
You want to get into this now?
Know what?
The same way you did before.
Caesar?  What is this?
I didn't expect --
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
That doesn't make any sense.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Caesar, this is crazy.
What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
They were in a car accident.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Now that's teamwork.
I should have let him kill you.
Lick me.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
You're doing everything yourself?
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
I guess I wanted to.
What's wrong?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
What are you afraid of?
What about that guy this morning?
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Do you think you know me like that?
Gino Marzzone.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
I'm just asking, what if?
There is no going back.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
No.
Forget it.
What do they want me to do?
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
MPG Capital.
...yes -- oui -- uh...
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes.
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?

Get the fuck away from my car.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
What?  Like amnesia?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
We're about an hour away.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
You got me pretty fucking curious.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Oh, Jesus...
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
I don't know. 
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
You could do that?
xxxxxx
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Shit, we didn't sign in.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
-- I'm on it --
What?
What the fuck is he doing?
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
...elephoned sir.
I think we'd better have a look.
Sign here, please.
... new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Layton.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Gillian Layton?
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Jack!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Ah ...
What?
Layton! Oh shit!
Not much.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
And you're mine.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Take her off the list.
We don't make mistakes.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack ...
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
You think these are tits don't you?
Them?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
It's heavy.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Suit me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
I was right! Step on it!
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
What happened to you after ...
Don't you like parties?
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
What?
You are good to me Sam.
I delivered it.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Hey - that's my desk!
I won't be held responsible.
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Hello ... hello ...
I don't know which numero.
Have you got one or haven't you?
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Are you expecting anyone?
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Pregnant.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
I guess I'll be going.
Does that hurt?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
The first is always the best.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
Maybe I should come up with you.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Frank!
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
What?
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Shit, shit, shit...
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Shut up a second...
And the rule was...
What's wrong with it?
It's not loaded.
No?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
You know what I...
Yes.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
I don't like the word gay.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Sure.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
What?
Ready.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Stop it.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
I really have to go.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
That's okay.
Oh.
I'll speak to you.
What?
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
You don't have to finish tonight.
Why so glum?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Hi.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
I like "godsend."
That actually goes on...
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
How can you say that to me?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Yes, I'm sorry.
I just might.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Are you nervous, Walter?
A girl with a body like mine?
Whaddya mean?
Anything new?
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Hi Walter.
What's up, Walter?
Is it murdered man?
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Walter...I can't believe it.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Would you pose for me for free?
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
Where'd ya buy that?
I didn't mean to.
Hiya Carla.
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Well, w-what did you do?
How ya doin'?
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
You are?
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Maxwell.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
Oh, OK.
If you see him.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
It's coffee.
You think?  Split?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
He doesn't look fifty.
You okay?
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
Are you okay?
) What do you think?
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Yes.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Where's the other one?
I have cheerleading squad.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Sporting events, yeah.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Fine.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Come one, that was so weird.
Thank you very much.
I don't get it.
Cassandra's really smart.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
I'm just a girl.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Got that.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Omniplex?
Oh, yeah!
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
The right nostril.  Good.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
I'll tuck you in.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
He' s confused--
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I doubt that.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Why baseball?
It's possible.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
What happened?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Don't bump me.
Why you shaking me off?
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
But he ain't seen my heat--
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
I was great, eh?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
What's wrong?
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You're a great catcher.
No.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
You were never my guest?!
That's right.
A powerful man.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
...been right, but who knows?
Oh, good.
Hey!
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Hello.
She's not here, Sam.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Now this is just a signature card.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
All right, Ace?
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
All right, fine.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
You lost your control.
Hey, she came to talk...
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
What are you -
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
And what'd she want?
Well...
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Seven o'clock?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Okay. Just take it easy.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Ginger's mission in life was money.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Oh, fabulous.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Yeah, how do I know?
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
How serious?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
I should have -
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
Should I let her in like - ?
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
Eight children! 
Okay, I'll -
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
What?
I just wanna get out of here.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
When I left here with the money...
Thanks, Nick.
What expenses?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
Yeah?
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Calm down! Calm down!
For what?
What're you gonna do?
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Are you sure?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Ace.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Okay.
Hm.
You did. You're right.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
Sure did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Is that what you want?
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
What about my money?
Get the fuck out of here.
Great.
Thank you. Very nice.
Come on.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
...all the luck in the world.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
He was just on the phone.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Come here, come here.
What's takin' so long over there?
Yeah, thanks a lot.
They're havin' a good time too.
I know. I know.
Don't know.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Tony.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Hey! Oh!
What's the matter with you?
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Yes, uh...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
What's the matter...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
We're waiting.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
What's the catch?
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
What did you say?
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
You think so?...Selina?
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
For when the time comes..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
I didn't hurt you.
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
Got your badge?
Lose the hardware now.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
What do you do for a living?
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Don't say that.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
What's going on?
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Yes sir.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
You wouldn't --
I'm still okay.
Do you think they'll walk away?
What's happening?
Naturally.
You won't live to see it.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
They saw you kill the driver.
Pass.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
I'm here.  Where are you?
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
You'll see her.
And then?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
What does it take to kill you?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
How far off are you?
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Who were you talking to?
Seems not.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
There's no lady here.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Is that good or bad?
See that, Col?
See what, Dil?
Saw that one.
Good thing in a man.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Fuck off, Dave.
You fucking promised.
Fuck off, Dave.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
In a way.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
No.
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
Who's she?
No, I didn't --
They're jealous.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
What'll it be?
Must be in love to manage that.
No.
Did he come here too?
Sorry, darling.
I said stop it.
How?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
What?
He'd bring me carnations.
Don't.
Come on.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
No.
You like me better like this.
Jimmy?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Died...
No.
You didn't.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Say it again.
Yes.
Yes. Now.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Fergus.
Please, Dil --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
What was it?
So what do you need, Fergus?
Did you give him it?
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No, what is the thing?
But, then, I don't have a choice.
You may be right.
I take pride in my work.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Peter.
I'm sure.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Just a girl.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Right.
Eat something, would you?
Can't.
This is a farce, man.
Am I?
Could you?
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
She's a friend of mine
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Yeah?
My special friend.
We don't look on it like that.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
You liked her?
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Why?
Faster than cricket?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
The teddy bear?
You didn't?
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
You don't look so bad in this light.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
Why?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
I love you, Adam.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- listen to me!
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Who?
Describe him.
That's the spirit.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
Very good.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Yes.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Sorry about that.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Me?
Not my room!
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
There must be some way.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Said what?
You did.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Why?
I'd love some, thanks.
Alex --
Yes, I know.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
But his mother --
He was American?
About how wealthy would you say?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I don't understand.
I found it! I found it!
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
How's that?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Come on. You can't stay here.
We'll find you a hotel.
Hallo, Peter.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Be careful, Peter.
So they think he left it with you.
How do you know what they're doing?
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Stop that!
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Who is it from?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
What's the matter, chérie?
You do?
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Not much further.
No honey.
I thought you'd be pleased.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
Should we close down any eruption?
Are you sure?
Well?
She was murdered?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I can.
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
What?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
You're the killed.
Mark Shale.
You eventually have to talk to him.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Twenty eight years ago.
I'll think about it.
I'm making you feel like meat?
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Jody. Wait.
Thanks for coming back for me.
Mom?
And the police did nothing?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
On what side of the family?
Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Ok.
Stacy?

...that is going to explode...
...-ty.
He could've called first.
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
...ya?

That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
I did not steal this truck!
Take your gun!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...-er!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Oh, shit.
...Night Shift, but you might...
...Pete.  Come on.
...you crazy bastard.
 I made it.
You okay?
Holy--!
Shut up!


Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
I'm a dangerous man!
Come on!

Oh, no!

Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
Hey, just shut up.

Reach into my pocket.
Yeah.
 All right.  Okay.
Okay. 


You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Sometimes the prey bites back.
...-ful?!
Oh, fuck!
What?
...-ta get outta here!
Hold this. 
Let's go!

Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Who drove the ice cream...
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Patriotism is its own reward.
Thank you very much.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

Vaughn.
Well, that just about figures for today.
I did what I could for you...
...take my sorry old truck.
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...

All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.


Is it--?
...to be off the island tonight.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Andrew...
...I wish they would've let me say something...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...and the government.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
...-ther orders?
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Get your links set up!
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
...-ty.
...noon.
Where's their protective...
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
You try anything, it goes in...
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
Your fellow hero, untouched...



You'd never understand!

I can handle it.
And don't give him any ice cream...
Rangers.
Forty-nine?
It's not over, Brynner.
What's going on, colonel?
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Who's your suspect?
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...back...
...and that power...
...-m-means, Mason.  
...that the prey can bite back.
...you, Mason?
We've got the real thing!
...tunnel!
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
...any idea what's goin' on here?!

...there's a colonel...
...tunnel now!
 
Yeah, I'm sure.


Gimme this god-...
 Talk to me.

It's too late, Mason. I've...
Always?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Who's the investigating officer?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
What for?
Why is that funny?
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
No.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
In the garage.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
How'd you get past the guards?
No.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
That's it?
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
You and your husband never discussed her?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
I have?
Where you were when your husband died.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Maid's night off?
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Your eye.
I know.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
The police?
I want to see her.
I said the truth!
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
I'll take care of it.
How do you know?
I'm all right.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Where'd he go yesterday?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
I'm sorry, I --
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
I never was.
Yes...
Never?
Mr. Gittes...
No, really?
No problem with me on the Job.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He did or he didn't?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They were partners.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Apple core?
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
So I can have these? 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
We'll talk about that later.
Who?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Let's hope they like it there.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Yes -
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
Ask them to sit down.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
But, Mr. Kane -
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Almost two to one -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
You really don't know who I am?
How old did you say you were?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Half past eleven.
At night?
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Can't say, sir.
Do you know what that is?
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Tired?
Yes?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Yes?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
What?
I'd like to talk to you about that.
Why is she leaving me?
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Thompson!
What did you get?
He married you, didn't he?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
What's this?
It's not the same.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
He went home to change for the big date.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
He was?
Just now.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
He's not invited.
He's your fiancé.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
What time was this?
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Who are you to make assessments?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
So?
What time do you have to stay till?
Oh yeah.
I guess.
And the second time around...?
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
Why not?
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Helluva game!
Yeah, right.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Jesus.
You hardly knew her!
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
If you go, I go.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Balls resting on his lips.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Because I'm here.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
What did she say?
You're kidding.
I'm not.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You're a snake.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
This life?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Leave me alone.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You need a ride?
Do you work tomorrow?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
You know him?
Excuse me?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
A half hour.
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Maybe.
Actually, that's his night job.
I'm trying.
Oh... Can I help you?
The white kind.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Please calm down.
HOW MANY?
Well...?
Something like thirty-six.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Thank you for being rational.
It was only a few times...
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
I'm not out of shape!
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
No way.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
You hope what feels good?
You'll be missed.
That's the price, my brother.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
He didn't ask me to...
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Which one?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
So, what do you see?
You know how the airlines are.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Look, I know--
The winds are picking up.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't expect you to understand.
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
Where?
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
He doesn't want my help.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Remember the first time we came up here?
You attacked me.
Want me to lead?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Don't let me fall!
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Go after her.
Where's the rest of the team?
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Man against nature, right Travers.
You got what we need?
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Been punished, yeah?
Try the wine!
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Thank you very much, sir.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
It's alright, thank you.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Thank you, sir.
Surprise?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Fine, fine.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
Crime?
Crabs?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Fine. Fine.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Yes.
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
You're not cured yet, my boy.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
I've done my best, have I not?
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
The ride is free.
It's no big deal.
Like what?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
How often you go?
Remember what you played?
Lay it on me.
Can't say that I do.
Can you finish on schedule?
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
He's not paying you one cent!
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Yeah?  So?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
...why is everything always about you...
Like what?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Two, two-fifty.
Good.  Help me out here.
The trunk?
I don't think I can do this.
I tried it.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Who's that?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I'm not catching a melody.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Max?  What are you doing?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
How long have you been a hit man?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
There you go...!
What'd they do?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Do you still ride?
What's the charge?
Just relax.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Realized what?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
You look great.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
My father's house.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
At a horse show.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
I'm sorry.
That's great.  Good for you.
What's that?
Liza Sutton is dead.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
And you feel bad for it?
<u>Why you</u>?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
The truth shall make you free.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
Terminal?
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
You do recognize it then?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Can I talk to you a second?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
We've lost contact.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Oh?  How's he doing?
You know why I'm here.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
David --
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
What?
Right.  Well.
And?
J39 Z186...?
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
I can't move any smaller.
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
No.  Please.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Some kind of circuitry...?
It's so... small.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Like it or not.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Did you love him?
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Why?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
It was quite a page turner.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Git your shovel and git to work.
I'll make it a dollar.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Here, Mom.
No.
That's good: he earned it.
Go hard!
We saw the broads.
Go git it, Luke.
Here's the Patrol.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Whatcha got?
What happened? How far did you get?
Oh lookit that brunette.
A cold drink.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
But, Luke...
Take it easy, Drag.
On my own.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Oh Lord!
That fool. That damn fool.
I'm in.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Kick a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
I was?  How you spell that?
Hello, Daryll Lee.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
For months... last October.
Nothing.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
Halloran.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
Who's the married man?
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Just horseshit luck.
Answer it.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
What about her arms?
Oh, maaaaan?!
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
That's going well, then.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
You should have gone to the funeral.
Have you seen his penis?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Yeah, everything's under control.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
There's a spider in my room.
It had this red spot on its back.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
Letty.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Good God.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Shocking, huh?
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
Not a one.
So, it's over?
No, I need some serious household advice.
Where to?
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Are you OK?
What is it? Are you OK?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
I love him.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
I heard about your friend.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on is phone?
Uh, yeah.
Good.   I'm good.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Why are you here?
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
And?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Yes.
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I only have your word for that.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
I thought they came with batteries.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Hadley --
Hello?
Man, I can get anything.
I've got a way with people.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
We had a deal.
Okay, we're square now, right?
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I was told to take what we have and go.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
What about transportation?
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
Get in the car.
No shit?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
J&amp;B?
I can't even hear myself think.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
You like shoes?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
What are you doing?
You're back!
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Then leave her to me.
I'm tired now.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Let's stop a moment.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
It has.  How's business?
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Yes.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
No onions though, okay?
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
Mom --?
Fun -- look at that guy...
Does she have a name?
You gotta go now, I bet.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Do you know what you destroyed?
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Top Dollar.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
I'm Kathryn.
That's right.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
What do you mean?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Junior.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
Need a lift?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
It was fine.
Who?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
And you promise to abide by it?
How was your date?
Wait, don't hang up.
What are you reading?
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Okay.
I do not.
No.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Please don't go.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
Hi.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
What are the boys like?
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Do you want to learn or not?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
I don't know.
He made you give him a blow job.
You think he'll like it?
I look terrible.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
I like it better when I'm on top.
I know.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Same time next week?
Whoa!
Yes!
And you think she bought it?
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
I'll think about it...
Call me later.
Interesting.
What's your problem?
So? How'd it go last night?
So what went wrong?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Kind of.
Tell me all the details.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
It clearly is why.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
What about her?
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I need to talk to Annette.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Yes, you already did.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
You're a lucky guy.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
What do you mean?
On the back street — a green house
Are they nice?
But it's already come true.
Irena.
Irena.
Ollie.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
What's funny?
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Yes, I did.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
But...
I've wanted a friend.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
But you must!
That one's an elm.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
I shall wear it in my hair!
But she's dead!
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
The Headless Horseman --
Hurry!
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
Good night, mother, good night.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
I mean where on your body?
What else is there?
Nearly four.
How have you been feeling?
No it's mom.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
He's a very talented musician.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
Maybe he's just shy.
Can't you get contacts?
Maybe they have to pee.
Hey, did you get contacts?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
No, did you fuck him?
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Give him the tampon test.
What the hell is the tampon test?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
So where's this infamous arm now?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
What happened to his tooth?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Peter knows something.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
What choice do we have?
I do development for TV movies.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Uh huh. So pee.
So pee? Here?
Look what you did!
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Where'd you get the bike?
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
On your desk.
Did you change your hair?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
When's the last time you saw him?
Are you following me?
So what book did you buy?
No, she died when I was twelve.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
Uh.... hi!
You had a date with Carlton?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
See he was cheating from the get go.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
What makes her think that?
Did we get those DNA tests back?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Was that for real down there?
Why do you want to speak to him?
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
No.  I, ah...
Donít kill me!
Water?
Your name is John White.
I'm sorry.  About before.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
First Lady...
... Alright.
The Washington Post.
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Do we have anything on the budget today?
What are you gonna do?
Bob...
Are you threatening me?
Uh-oh...
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Dave -- I'm working.
They could put you in jail.
I don't think so
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Choices?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
That'd be great.
No.
At a press conference.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Dave...
Dave!
Gimme a quarter.
This is from the people of Burundi...
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
What do you mean?
Oh... Hi.
You ever think back to how you started.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
I can't say.
You ever use it?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
I care about the homeless.
Anybody would have done it.
I don't mind.
I never thought I'd...
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Quiet!
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
Dios mia.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
It will?  How do you figure?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Yes sir.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Nuwanda?  Please?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Charlie...
It's all right, Chet.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
It does?  What?
So, uh, where are you in school?
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Uh-huh.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
But father, it's not fair.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Father!
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Look at this.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
A play, dummy.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Er  No.
It's my birthday.
I will be with thee straight.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Put more into it!
Do you have to quit the play?
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
Who asked any?
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Not an option.
Who gives a shit about aft?
That's where my boat's moored.
I'm not staying here!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
Right... You have a boat.
The "come back" kind.
Like cattle...
Finnegan...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Let's just keep going.
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
Can we use our indoor voice please...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
It's okay...come on...
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
Where are you going?
Nothing.
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
She fucked you?
John,we're going huntin'.
Nick's going?
I know, but...
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You're back.
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
You mean...?
Get anything?
You know a guy named Merle?
Oh, well...
Hey, Nick...
No?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Nick, she won't say why.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
What?
Frost.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Promise! You gotta promise!
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
What do you think?
Forget Sal.
Three bullets -- minimum.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
That's it. No. No way.
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
What the hell's that for?
No!
Yeah.
The fuck I did!!!
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
I want to stop aging.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Sir, your transmission's fading.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Can I ask you something?
I'll be okay.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
How do I look?
What's this?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Hi.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Jabez! Careful --
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Belle.
No, Stone!
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
-- of what happens after we die!
I do -- and I think you should too.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
I'm through with you.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Not long -- now.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Jabez -- help!
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Oh, Jabez.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Who is it?
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Hard luck -- like me.
You found it in the barn, hey?
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
What's that you say, Son?
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
What's happening?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
You...you're an American?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Yo!
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Bullshit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
This is --
So whatsa deal?
Jesus, you're the man!
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Heidi, I'm dying.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Jenny?
Hello, Sonny.
How are you doing?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
You're crazy.
That's it.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Why you going to Algeria?
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Shit...
I don't have a choice.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
Calm down, you're not ...
What the fuck do you want?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
We're all set at Kennedy.
What's the matter with you?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
Sure - we like you.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
I'm glad it's okay.
It's up to you ladies.
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
It's the cops.  Shit!
I want him to think that.
Get over there!
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
We can't stay here.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Did Pop come down?
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
What?
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
Something is going down. Something bad.
Do you know where Danang is?
We're late.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Where is Domino?
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
You the man.
Make it plain.
I thank you.
Good morning.
I hope the block is still standing.
Jade.
No.
I'll see you out.
Innocent!
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
How are you holding up in this weather?
C Duracell.
WAKE UP!
Don't worry about it.
It's a fucking shame.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
How long then?
Trust me.
Why you gotta curse?
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
That's the dope.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Sez who?
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Too many pizzerias already there.
I didn't think so.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Just down the hall.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
I know I am, Mom.
No no no no no.
Why not?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
You're it.
You're it.
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
I don't think so.
HARRY, can you hear me?
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Who?
Yeah, that's why I asked.
But my mom gave me the map.
I made the polar bear pants.
A float!
Guys, this is much better.
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Damn! What are the odds?
She's one of a kind.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
That's my boyfriend.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Sure.
Have you got what I want?
You know I do!
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Times two.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Where is it?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
What happens now?
Yes?
Yes?... How was your journey?
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Yes...
Always.
Why do they come?
Liet?
The Voice again.
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Why were you buying a coffin?
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Thank you.
Don't you bave a car?
But you're a big star!
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Who do I play?
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
"It is my home."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I've never seen anything like him!
What do you mean?
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
These shoes are itchy.
And who may you be?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
It's that easy?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
It's a damn good role.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
That's not true --
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Are you a fruit?
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
What are you making?
I am.  How's your father?
Did you find it boring?
What was that?
Dynamite --
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Huh?!
What's uncanny?
I don't know.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
You're nuts.
No, uh...
They tore her dress! ...
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Thank you. Can I see her?

No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Right.
Yeah?
Send him away.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
She could've been a nurse.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
What is she, at work?
She won't.
I can't?
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
What does this mean?
Never would be plenty.
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
You batted or you bunted?
You do though, you look great.
Really?
Can't we just --
What are you doing?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
The what?
Oh yeah.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
Everybody's someone.
What did you do to your hair?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
What?
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
I'm doing all right.
All right.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
What's the dif --
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Who is it?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
That girl's an idiot.
Oh!!
We don't have foibles.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Yeah?
I can't wait to start campaigning.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
I'm looking at new cars.
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
Here?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Should we get a what?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Three twenty-five.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
And 290 "disregards," right?
Where 're you going?
What...?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Paul, get out!
You dumbshit!
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Tell me about Patchett.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Did they deserve it today?
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
Did you talk to Exley?
I want to know about Exley.
Call me Dudley.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
<u>What do you want</u>?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Maybe.  I don't know.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
At least not anymore.
Ellis Loew.
You wanted to meet here?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
I never truck with no sissies!
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
Gone.  Not a trace.
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Why?
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
Damnit...
Even I'm not that crazy.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
She is Lana Turner.
What's on the call sheet?
What are you talking about?
Lynn Bracken.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
You sound like you mean it.
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
I just called it.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Listen--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
What do they have to do with this?
Okay.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that--
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
Did you call anyone?
How do you know so much?
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
They come after you?
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Fuckin-A.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
No he won't.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
What are you dialing?
Feeling lucky?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Eight.  Size eight.
I know, but--
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Yes?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
I've seen it.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
It's really over?
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
And then what?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
DePinto?
Brill.
Brill?
Other than Brill.
Why?
I know.
I can't.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
We believe he did.
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Gentlemen--
Bobby--
Good point.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Where's mom?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Alright!
No, but they took my blender.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
They killed Rachel.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Bobby--
Why would they--
I don't know!
I have a family.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
What does that have to do with you?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
We'd have to--
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
Yes sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
What's your ETA?
That insults them.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Excuse me?
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
This is - what is this?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Would you let me pass?
Don't leave me!
Yes.  Absolutely.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Sorry, what's your point?
Good morning!
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
No.
What do you want?
So you can shoot a pistol?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
Moose.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
Are you asleep?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
He's Canadian.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
No!
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
What are you up to?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Of course.  When?
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
A bit of one.
I had a hotel room.
Yessir.
I don't think so.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
You ordering chop suey again?
We're getting close.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Too late now.
Then don't.
I'll call an ambulance.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
You can't.
Oh?
We going somewhere?
But--
What about your bags?
I go in alone.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
I didn't mean to get personal.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
You're nervous again.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Camera in the--
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Oh my god, I thought--
Well...What are we doing?
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
You shouldn't have.
That was a lifetime ago.
The disc is still in there.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Which is--
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
Remind me why.
You two make quite a couple.
This is just show and tell.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You'll just have to have faith.
You're giving them to me?
My friend, you always surprise me.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Right.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You're a girl.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Bullshit.
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
And that's what caused the contamination?
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
Hey.  I like working with you.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
I want my fucking money --
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
What kind of things come up?
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Why not?
Ho - ly - shit.
I did.  Both.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
The extortion, the threats ...
When'd they file the demur?
Did he say why?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Nope.  Maiden.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Have you been to the water board?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
You got a little girl?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
What do you want, a joke?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
About this.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
I can't leave my job, George.
No, I need my car --
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
What?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
I can help them!
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Growls a reserved greeting.
Howls.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
That's right.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Not you?
An Imperial probe droid.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
I don't know what he's talking about.
I take it back.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
He found him in a junk pile ...
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Probe?  What probe?
About what?
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
I always said you were a gentleman.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
How's your mining operation going?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
It's a lovely outpost.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
The deflector shields are gone.
What??
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
What's in there?
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
With food?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Primitive?
Cuervo...?
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Where's Plissken?
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Shit.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
I see your point. What's the favor?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
So what does this thing do?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Later.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
What the hell is this?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Of Merlin?
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
What is this place, Merlin?
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
You freed it, son?
Who is, then?
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Who does it serve?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
I?
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
What honey?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
May I ask...?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Would you like some more coffee?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Fine thank you.
Is it coming out Willie?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Chris MacNeil?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Did he tell you about my party?
No I didn't know you had one.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
You wouldn't.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Like what?
No.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
We'll see when we get home okay.
Hey, where'd this come from?
Yeah.
Wait a minute you need two.
Do you not like him like daddy?
What are you doing here?
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
I came to say goodbye.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Where's Regan?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Save your servant
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Can you give her something?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Yes?
Who is it?
I don't know.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Honey ...
Beasley.
How many?
How will he eat?
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Why the interest?
No, I mean it.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
I don't gotta go.
What do you mean?
It's me.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
Nice, huh?
Terrific.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
I'm not unhappy.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I'll drop the eighths.
Where the hell is she?
Get out of here!
You hit me.
Just a lucky guess.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Christ, can't you hear it?
Because I can hear it.
What's the matter with you?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
What?
Huh?
Celebrating.  Join me?
Couple years.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
What channels it on?
Spur of the moment.
Blanche.
Well, that's fine --
Uh... he knows it.
You're an hour and a half late.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
We ran long.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
What's wrong with it?
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
The switch.  Hit the switch.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Huh?
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Is that important?
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Funny job.
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
Is that the way it is?
Where's egghead?
He takes after our mother.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Oh?
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
So. How are you?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Why would he need more?
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
... I was dreaming ...
Something good?
Must've been after we got engaged.
What more proof do you need?
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
What do you mean?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
Stay away from my family!
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
Kim?
What?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
-- what?
Nothing.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
That’s right. And auto supply...
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
She is relentless.
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
Look, I don’t know what you’re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Don’t  go, Jack...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Because that’s where I live.
She’s your dog, Jack.
...my feet are hurtin’...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
How can you do that?
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
You mean this chocolate cake?
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
A perk for what?
Are you out of your mind?
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
Don’t do that...
Not with what they pay me...
Jesus, Jack...
Jack.
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
Okay, I’ll take them...
Of course I did.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Reed? ... Sue?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
And they're changing into...
What do you mean "complete"?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
What?  What do you mean you --
You <u>were</u>?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
What's going on?
Please don't make this personal --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
I'd hold that off awhile.
The Other Side got to him.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Listen...the Heart.
We must!
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Then how come it worked loose?
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
That's what they pay me for.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
Doctor, what's wrong?
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
You left something out.
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
May I?
Atomic fuel?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
...Is this a fucking joke?
I don't know. Few munce.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
What the heck d'ya mean?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
...The heck d'ya mean?
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Oh, now he's adorable.
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah, he -
Both of these.
Mr. Mohra?
I unnerstand.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
You're not a C student.
Uh-huh.
You know what a disparity is?
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
...Yah, okay...
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, so we're all set.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
No, no, fax is -
Well, what do ya mean?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Good day, sir.
Shep said 8:30.
Ya got the car?
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Yah.
You're darned tootin'!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Carl somethin'?
Call 'em up.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah, that's me.
Yah?
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
It's okay...
So?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Whose car?
Thanks, hon.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
This is do-able.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Can't you give me something?
Sure.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Should we?
Where have you been the last few weeks?
It's for men.
No... no problem.
Do you care?
Yeah?
Is that what you're calling it?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
What?
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
No, supply oxygen?
What do you want me to do?
Well, uh... great.
I guess so.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Don't I?
Yes, you can.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What fight?
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
Hum.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Promise you won't.
What... ?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Tyler...
You know what I mean.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
What are you doing?!
This conversation...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You... you can't be serious about this.
I'm pulling the green wire.
Defuse the bomb, please.
I think this is about where we came in.
Paraffin.
You need me.
I swear on my life, I won't...
What are you doing?
What?
What?
Look at me...
Who is this?
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
Did you hear what I just said?!
I... I don't know...
Please, what else could it mean?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Six duds in a row.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What?
I've got to stop and help those people.
Maybe.  What's this about?
May we come in?
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
You mean Alex Browning.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Shouldn't we pull over?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
I guess so.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
What on Earth are they doing?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
"It?"
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Cuticle lacerations.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
What do you call that?
Batteries not included.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
Alright.  Home run.
I'm getting him out.
Gawd, you look awful.
I thought he was with you.
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Thanks.
And how'd you sneak up like that?
You think you are... .
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Let's do it.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Most men are.
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
What if I was a relative?
Where you comin' from?!
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Where?  Maybe we can.
.....Me neither.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
How un-sixties of you.
Huh-huh.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Oh, Lydia!
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>!?
I'm the one what?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Will you shut-up!!!
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
You don't have to say that.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Well, id'n that nice.
Cerveza.
Serveza yourself!
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Is it my turn again?
Yes.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
No.
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Just finish eating.
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
Washington.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
I don't make the rules.
Tea.
Now don't...
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
What?
It's not that bad.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Where is she, anyway?
If you're free.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
I don't find your language that charming.
What?
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Four or five years.
What?
Oh, for chrissakes...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
It's a Borzoi.
And what about love?
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Mass production is what does it.
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Then don't go out with me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
Victor.
So you got a girl?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
You got a boyfriend?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Come down!
Wussup?
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Your friend must be misinformed.
Jus' from around the way.
I know how ta get him back if you want.
Unbelievable.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
You're kidding.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Hey you're really nuts.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Full name.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
This one's going to be even more fun.
Funny old bird.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
No idea at all?
Affirmative.
Thought so. What for?
You gonna nail the chief?
Gum thought Brazil.
That's it.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Good evening.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Check.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
They bust you every week.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
We can't talk about it here.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Why don't you try suicide?
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Yeah.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
John who?
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Lunch...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
What are you talking about?
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I'll take you to a game.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
What is this....
You can't do that.
The door was unlocked.
Who are you?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Two...
You broke it? You know the source?
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
You okay?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
I tried to help you...!
So, did you find my dad?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Like me.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
'Bye, Johnny...
You don't use shit?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
I don't...
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Il fallait le faire.
We must follow it.
There's nobody like that on six.
Yeh?  Who else?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Morning.  Sometime.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Drink this.
The greaser with the blonde.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
Suspicion of what?
Why not?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
They around?
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Baltimore?
I'm off.
Wish you weren't.
I'm serious.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Hey, bud.
Frank, we need to talk...
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Sorry 'bout that.
Uh huh...
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
No, not yet.
I think I'm losing you.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She just died, your mother just died?
What kinda twisted animal.
I'll warn them.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Please, Dad, just do it.
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
How you feeling?
John.  John, you all right?
Longbranch...?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
You're not looking too good.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Uh, huh.
What is that?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
What's this?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Could we move a little faster?
What are we gonna do?
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
....with a woman's touch.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Ahh, nothing.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
What it is?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
No.  No, it's not...
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
It's all over.
Lake Forest Green?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Well, let's hope not!
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Anything else?
No, I --
Look, I don't want your money!
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Why did you want her body?
Tell me.
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Don't do anything stupid.
I know what it sounds like.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
Right.
Did you hear that?
This is Jason's fault!
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
I demand to know what is going on...
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
I...I can't...
It's not that simple.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It's just a review.
Don't wait Efor me.
He carries a gun.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Paisley Porter.
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
Our Peter?
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Opening night?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Your father said you might be here.
Two-all after six.
I'll have whatever she's having.
Opening night, Lillian.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Alma Wetzel.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
A thousand things.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Where's your elastic brace?
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
What am I doing?
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
Why does it matter?
They're my team.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
hat was this morning.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Game six is history,pal.
Sidney remains optimistic.
I have excellent long-term memory.
What color?
And the Father replies?
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
Is it true?
Do you think he can do it?
He's a very sweet man.
Home.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Yes.
Are you sure?
God gave you ten thumbs.
You're a clergyman.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
And Jinnah?
What do you want?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
You mean a general strike?
In England, I was a poor student but I --
The fools!  Sorry...
I dined at the prison.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
How often do you test, Director?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Hello.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
You okay, Jerome?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
Call German.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Not bad, Jerome.
Thank you.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
How do I square the accident?
Friend?
They found an eyelash.
In the South Wing.
What happened?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
I can't do this.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
I get my own help.
What about them?
Hello, McCoy.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
Feel good?
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
Just like old times?
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
What about the bank?
He must have.
I can handle it.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
There may be a hunting party.
We better stick here till tonight.
I don't know.
Are we going to make it?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Can I help you?
Drive.
Which way?
Come on. How much?
That's what I want.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You do what he says, Harold.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
A couple of weeks back.
How?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
What name?
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What was bugging Frank?
I work for him.
Was he?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
You sure about that?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Now tell me the truth.
Oh, what you doing now?
That must be interesting.
At me friend's house.
That's what I was wondering.
It just would. He was always the same.
You work here, Keith?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
I'll call the police.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
You're a bastard.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
Do us a favour?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yeah.
We've got to take you back to London.
What's that?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
I'm not?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Mmm...
They killed the goose.
...this shit...
You're on this...
Eh...?
For some sales pro...
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
You...
That's what I...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Somebody...
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
How do you know he'd buy them?
No.  Not actually.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Yes.
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
Yes.  I'm sure.
...you don't have to come in...
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
That's right.
Is that what I just said?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole the phones.
He said we...
Yeah.
A waste of time?  Why?
No.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Why?
You think so?
Did the leads come in yet?
Who used to say that?
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
You have a problem?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Shelly...
...no...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Yes.
And what if you don't close.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
What are we going to say?
That's alright.
Mmm.
What are you talking about?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I don't know what you are saying.
It was his idea.
Only the beginning...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Because I don't like you.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
They took the phones...
Oh, Christ.
I'm sorry...?
Rick...?
Yes.
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
I don't understand.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
This.
Fuck you.
You just this morning...
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Your farewell to the troops?
They didn't get my contracts.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
John...
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
We have no money for a rug.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
Bought at the airport.
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Michael...
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
You would risk your life for strangers?
I understand...
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Ready, Frankie.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
I never met them.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Beautiful.
How long does this go on?
Am I a prisoner?
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Hello?
Why didn't someone tell me!
You're going to talk to him now.
Yes.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
It was a boy.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
Are you Klingman?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
Says who?
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
You want a war?
We got friends in the commission.
I'm talking about Italians!
He supports me.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
Sure.  I loved it.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Why?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
What do I do?
What have you done with him?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
I stink to high heaven right now.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
What did she mean by going flooey?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Broke is more like it.
You went to university?
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
Is this David's doing?
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Ah.  A philosopher.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Is that really her?
It's not like her.
Is that --?
But you said --
What happened?
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Need some help?
Hey, Boone.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Yes.  Perfectly.
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
Jimmy.  How are you?
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
I don't mind.
Can that count as one question?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Fish.
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
I think about that night a lot...
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
I'm not interested --
Sound it out for me.
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
How is he?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
And this has what to do with me?
You know my back.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
Double-meaning intended --
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
okay ...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
What does that mean -- ?
You look good...
No.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Any more, O -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
What are you doing here?
You hear me?
The era when crime didn't pay --
Come here -
What are you doing here?
Where'd you find this one?
Where we going -- ?
And you got some Italians -- ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
What the hell's that -- ?
So, you seeing anybody?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
You okay -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
You remember Junie?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
Tell me...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
Why don't you leave him alone?
Which way's out, man -- ?
Tell him. It's okay.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
I'm in construction.
My bag. My bag.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
Henry.  Wake up.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
I can't do it anymore.
With what?
You what?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
What?
I gotta talk to you.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
No, no. It's okay.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
I got dry cleaning.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
She didn't do it again did she?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
How's the woman?
No, I had to talk him down.
You're kiddin' me.
Okay.
Oh...
How you doin'?
WILL!
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
I told you, I just got change.
Some other guy?
Did your Uncle get arrested?
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
I have about seventy-three...
Codebreaking.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Seven.
What're you doing?
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
Hey, how you doin'?
Find out what?
Uh-oh.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Who?
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Oh, that's nice--
Come in.
So I hear you're taking some time.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Who is he?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
What places?
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
What did you think?
What?
They're all dead.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'll keep in touch.
No. Thank you.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
I kind of got that impression.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
So you just want to use me and go?
No.
Oh, you will?
Free?
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Do you keep in touch with them?
No.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
So, do you play the piano?
What am I scared of?
You doin' the hirin'?
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
So long.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Say, who runs this place?
Why, you're the preacher!
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
And you ain't ashamed?
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
I dunno. Payin' five now.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
Sure do.
What you mean?
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Ma, you sick?
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Sure. Good-by.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Are you crazy?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Can you pick peaches?
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Remember high school?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Insane.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Yes.
...Let me get my coat.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
I was leaving.
That's probably a good idea.
What if I come back?
You kill people. 
How do you know?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
I work alone.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
What do you want?
Like a union?
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Is that right?
There you go. I left it blank.
Well?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
I'm not happy.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I bought a new rug.
No, I don't have one.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Paul?
What the hell happened to you?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
To shoot you. Correct.
This is Annie MacLean.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
You okay?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
A jogger, huh?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Thanks.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
What about him?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Fine!
Did he tell you that?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
I'll come.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
What?
How's everything?
Did you speak to Farlow?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Hi.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
What did he say?
What did he say?
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
I'll help you with the coffee.
You don't seem to upset?
Frank's a good man.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
Diane!
That's what some folks say.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Would you let me ride your horse?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
She gonna be long?
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
I know where he goes.
I can't... not yet...
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
Jude, you okay?
I know. Amazing.
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
You think it's cool?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Welcome to our show!
That's far out!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
I want it to have my children!
Oh wow, we are fried.
Hmmm.
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Blow me.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Talk to me.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
He's not in this class.
What the hell are you doing?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
I'll make it up to you!
Alright, so what have we got?
What's happening?
Joey, Joey...
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Any questions?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Hello, operator services.
You're late.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Who's that?
When did this happen?
An accident?
Mom, please
Its too late.
Has he been prepped?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Do you love me Rachel?
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Double scoops?
Jamie, what happened?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
I can't.
Rachel!
That's all the windows, Dad.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
You look sharp. You understand?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Annie, was that you?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
I don't want to.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Want a beer?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
What do we do?
Sure...
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Sure.
Not any more.
After the movie.
The bogyman!
Promise?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
I saw him...
Are you sure?
There's nothing else I can do.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
We're a big hit.
Yeah.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Yeah.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Hi, Dusty.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
...with the affiliates.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Oh, my goodness!
What are you doing here?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
I'm...all right.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Oh.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
But it hasn't been forever. 
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
I didn't say that.
You matter to me.  Completely.
I am... I did slave all day.
Yeah.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Want some coffee or tea?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
No.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Huh?
How is everything?
Oh!
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Hey!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Okay.
Don't you think she does?
Frederick didn't come with her.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Really?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Uh-huh.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Boy--
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
My script?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
You have.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, yeah?  What?
Okay.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
...you don't have to think.
Some museum director disappeared.
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Or, perhaps...
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Who would that be.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Not with any certainty we...
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Somewhere in Italy.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
He don't like popcorn.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...young boys, still...?
Mmm...
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Let the girl go.
For a consideration.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Starling...?
You seen John Brigham...?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
I said how's your baby...?
I have had many excellent meals there.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
And?  Then?
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
No, I don't get you...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
Indeed we were.
Thank you, Cordell.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
Look what they put her on...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I know where he is.
...<u>sadly</u>...
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
Yes.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
Now what? What did I do this time?
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
No.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Talia, don't go!
I hope so...
No, they're not from Wendy.
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Do you really not believe in God?
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
What do you want me to say?
Oh, I have to hear this.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
What is this shit?
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
You can be so immature!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
I guess.
You two....
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
playfully shoves his hand away.
Look who I've found!
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
What does old Stew want?
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
Look, Mother!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Hello!
It doesn't matter.
That.
What?
I'm coming with you.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Of course, yes.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
Skin cancer.
No.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
I have my connections
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Zero's a number right?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
What?
Thanks.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Dreams?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
You got a drinking problem or what?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Often, uh.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Nothin'.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
You!
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
I snuck in.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
You were... very... inspiring.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
It's not right, Gale...
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
John, I know all about it.
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
What about?
I didn't ask him.
Safety?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
Who doesn't?
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
About us.
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
I'm thirsty.
A man?  Was it a dream?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
But it's what we want.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
What?
No.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Are we gonna buy this house?
Neil, do you mind?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I have a cold.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
I'd like that.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
They appear to be authentic.
This ties in with Nash.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Where were you last night around nine?
No.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Yes -- I think it is.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
I'm sure they will.
How long is the voyage?
Living.  Remember?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
I stood up first.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
I would like to say goodbye.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Aye?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Why not?
Leaving?  For how long?
I cannot explain.
Why are you doing this?
If it's good advice.
Then who's Russell Nash?
Who was that man last night?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
You didn't answer my question.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
He's in there!
What now?
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
We found him this morning.
Why did you wait?
I'll no forget you.
You kept it?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
I think he's dead!
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
I guess not.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
We're fucked.
How about the cop?
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
You have his address?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Yeah.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
What?
Kevin left without you.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
Is something wrong with Jane?
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Special Agent Jones.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The United Nations are still here.
What did you overhear?
Satellites.
And what will they do with these satellites?
The high command? Our high command?
I'll be over.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You think they will believe you?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Mr. Manager.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Where are we going, sir?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
What do you want?
He will be here.
What?
Our cards, please.
How much?
Was there blood?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Any luck?
They are being evacuated.
What about us?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
You cannot go alone.
What?
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Rutaganda's place?
That is why they call it coach?
Twelve are dead.
He has taken the presidential suite.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Three times, to be exact.
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
Oh, Jesus....
-- the stained glass --
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
Or an on-line computer.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
...Jesus H. Christ.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
You're hurting me.
-- the sadistic prick --
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Where is she?
-- what...are...you...going...to --
No...
No, no, it's just --
What?
First time for everything.
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Believe me, we need to.
-- hey! --
Melissa...?
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
It might have been her mother.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Good-bye.
Where does this amulet come from?
My angel!
H-how long will it take?
He's blessing the house.
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
What will Aubrey think?
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
No.
I think everything's ready.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
I think we should do it.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
Your daughter's been taken.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
What do you mean?
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
What?
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Thank you.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
You re not thinking of going to...
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Welcome to Rome, sir.
My life is not some deal.  I...
How.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
What have you been doing?
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Cat got his tongue?
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Get away from there, convict!
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Bunny, not you too?
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
The Dancing Dingus!
Snappy.
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
A sawbuck!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
...What happened?
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
...You son of a --
Phony, huh?
How long've you been down here?
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Norville.
Geez, I --
Sir?
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Damnit, where's my car!
Finally.
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Ya don't say.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Old Faithful.
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
What's this?
I'm afraid so.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
But she's not dead, Wes.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
It is not beautiful.
Can't I take it for you?
Why was the maid crying?
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
Help me? How?
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Sure dad.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
Yeah?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
-- 73
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
It's really quite all right.
I used to know how to cook.
Yes.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Am I right or am I right?
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Want some gum?
I don't know.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Right.
The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Communist Viet Cong.
Yes, sir.
Good.
Just after Leland Street.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
He would have liked that.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
No.
You know my plan of action.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's not what he thinks.
Will...I...
I told you I don't remember.
Since grade school.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Yes, and very beautiful.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
It will grow back again!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Don't Louis --
He jests.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
You want death? Is it death you want?
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Come, you're going to feed now.
What have I done?
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
What about coffins?
You loved your wife, surely.
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
Is that bad?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
That was heart attack time, Karla.
There's nothing between Will and me.
No means yes.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Be careful, Julie.
Oh, god, it's you --
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Ahh, that feels great.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
Take this.
They were cut loose.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Where's Thea?
What are you doing?
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
But one must love a father.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
Her family name?
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Oh, now —— now look here ——
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
What did you stop it for?
George Bailey.
You sent for me, sir?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Well?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Well, what happened to you?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
What?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
No charge.
What boat you sailing on?
What's that?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
You're not paid to be a canary.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Hello, George, how are you?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I know, but . . .
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
It's important.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Pop!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Have you notified the police?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
I don't like coconuts.
I'm not very good at this.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Too young or too old?
You may kiss my hand.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Mary! Mary!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
You forgot something.
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
For me...?
How fast is enough?
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Is she responsible for the punch?
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Maybe by now they are.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
We're carrying weight.
Coming up!
I thought you said she was going with us?
Want to talk about it?
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Mike's out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
What else is there to do?
Pop....
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The whale's mouth?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
What makes you think there might be?
Fooling around?
Hey!  That's my boss!
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
We're alone.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
When?
Me neither.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Right after, the Kids went out?
What is it?
I'm not sure I can.
You're going sailing.
Brody's riding his tower.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Don't feel bad.
He's going with you, Doctor.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
It's Miller time!
Thank you.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Pre-opening jitters.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
That macho pompous English --
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
No.
Are you scared?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Sounds wonderful.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
I am.  You're not.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Still sleeping.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Hold still, damn it!
I don't talk that way.
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Calvin said it was all right.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Polar bears in Georgia???
Reach for the limit I always say.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
Five hundred yards.
No way.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
How'd you do in school?
Gee, it's good to see you!
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Henny Youngman....
Beginning of what?
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
We'll be there....
Michael!  This thing working?
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
All you all right?
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
Trying to write our report....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
A big one....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
Why?
Hurry!
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Can't this thing go any faster?
She's a tough lady....
The females have eggs....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Okay...we got it together....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
'A Moray eel....'
You told me what?
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Yes.
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
What do you want it for?
You believe me, don't you?
Did he shut you down?
Ease off, John ..
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Now?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
No.
And did they?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
No.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Hamlet. Have you read it?
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Have you known her long?
Really? What did he say?
You know? How do you know?
Why can't I stay with you?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
What was she like?
How you doing on those shoes?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
He's happy, darlin ..
She married some English prick.
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Don't ever stop fucking me!
I just heard.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.
He's asleep, right?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Oh come on --
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Can I help?
Oh tsht. Yes.
Hello?
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Oh my God.
Do you have something to drink?
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Fine, I just --
Sure you're okay to drive this?
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't know --
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He's coming over.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Rod --
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
You're telling me to dance.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
Beautiful.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
You gonna get that --
I'll go back to them.
Marcee --
You...
No.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Can you be quiet?
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
It's not safe.
You mean it?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
Absolutely not.
How would you classify it?
I try not to.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Bonitas.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
No. I couldn't see.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
What kind of gun is that?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
What?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
It's... behind... us.
She's gutty.
We can't stay in here!
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Ian.  It's guano.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
-- way we could safely --
Hold it down, Nick!
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
Ask her.
You've got to be kidding.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
The door security systems are shutting down.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Uh - - about two million.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Did I say jerk?
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Why?
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Oh, shit.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Why not?
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Can we chance moving him?
Faster, faster!
I can't see.
Are they heavy?
Yeah.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I threw up.
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You have no idea.
You got any kids?
I didn't say I was scared.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Can't you stop these things?!
It's safe.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
We miss you.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
No, but...
Yeah?
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
What happened?
_Krueger_...
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Are you going to plead insanity?
You watch this garbage?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
How do we prove it?
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
That doesn't make sense.
You saw him?
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I don't know what you could have read.
A man must eat --  And drink.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
No, sir.
I do.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
I suspected that he -- well.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Are you free tonight?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
You don't believe that.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
Eight -- and seven months.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
That's <u>mad</u>.
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
-- You seem amused.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
It usually is.
I could always apply there.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Ann ... Ann!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Are you nervous Jack?
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Sure dear, yes.
Mm.
-- May I? It's so --
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
My name's John Klute.
Gee.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
-- Tuscarora --
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Most of them.
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Did you like my friend Frankie?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Is there anything more I could --
Well --
Yeah, you got to me.
Arlyn Page.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
The same as Jane McKenna.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
How do you know how bad it was?
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
You must be discouraged.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
It's in the report.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
I think she's trying that.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
What else do you know?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
What do you like best about her?
Ladies and gentlemen...
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
All it is is onions and gravy.
I want a pizza.
I think I'm going to throw up.
Daddy?
Sleep tight.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Are you going to get remarried?
I don't understand, daddy.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
And would you describe those years as happy?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Yes.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
How should I know?
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
I know....I know.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Fine.
John?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Three.  And add some basil.
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Ted, I just heard...
I am sorry, Lhamo.
But, I am in charge.
I do, now.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
I miss my brother.
Who am I?
I accept it. What is suffering?
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
Tell me.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Britain chooses not to.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
What does the butter spot feel like?
Is that true or pretend?
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
I will miss you.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
I do.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
I haven't broken any laws.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
They don't really attack underwater and--
Was he a good man?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Right.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Such the flirt.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Eh.  Fuck it.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Good.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Excuse me?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Really--
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Alright, Jack!
We might as well pack.
He's floating.  Take it home.
Watch out!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
I'm ready when you are.
You said nobody came in here!
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
I wouldn't.
Well.  At wakes.
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Are you alright?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
<u>You</u>?
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
What'd I do?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Why not?
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
That wasn't me.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
What would it take?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Starling -
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Did you ever work with her?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I have no doubt of it.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
The death of my father.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Later, listen, I'll -
Early. Still dark.
What did you do?
So you ran away...
Starling.
Dr. Lecter -
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
We leave in the morning?!
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Your "father"?
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Sorry to disappoint you...
There was none!
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
No.
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Gold could be arranged.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
And?
They found this?
Was there such a thing?
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What has?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Jesus Christ...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
What?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Not yet.
Personal effects...
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
Typhoon?!
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Who were you talking to?
What's wrong?
The shack...
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Probably no longer than four weeks.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
What's that?
I thought this was a pub.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Son?
Who was that?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Er well, yes we do.
What they like then?
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
That's it all done, we are off.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
I hope this is the right move.
There's nothing in it!
What the hell are you doing here?
Right as rain.
Well, what did he say?
I think I would rather just turn them over.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I like your bar.
I want your bar.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What are you doing, Plank?
You know how much it is, Nick.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Tom, you're all heart.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
I don't know what the big deal is.
Oh, come on, Amado--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Sam the Man.
How's business?
I hear they're closing that post down.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
So is Buddy on your short list?
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Same weight I always was.
The Trail of Tears.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
I have a B average.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
This place is a gold mine.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Maybe.
Mikey look at this--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Pleased to meet you.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
This is an official visit, then--
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Your mother was a saint.
When we backed you--
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
You thought any more about our murder?
The Perdido thing?
The Sheriff.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You've got your mother, your kids--
How come it feels the same?
Two years.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Yeah--
You're out early.
I'm going over to the other side.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
You think we need a new jail?
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
Yeah. It's quiet--
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
They go together.
Nix.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Maybe they're not tricks.
Thanks, Billy.
Right.
Right.
What about death?
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
They won't tell you anything.
How did it go today?
So why did you marry him?
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I wasn't.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
What was that?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
--vanished.
I heard he was the best.
We've never met.
Mine.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
I don't think the dead much care.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Yeah.  You could say that.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
He deserved it.
He did something with the ground.
Can you do it?
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Why would I want to?
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
What do you do?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, you smiled.
We established that we have no communication.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Where's your husband?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Thanks.
Yeah, its really different here.
Ok, well... I love you.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Hello?
What?
That's ok.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Great.
How'd it go today?
You wanna come?
Hair stuff?
Will you please stop smoking?
Oh, the record company sent these...
Are you sure you want to stay?
Lauren?
John! What are you doing here?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
My secretary?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
Why are you doing this to me?
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
I'll bet.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Get up!!
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
He was trying to tell me something.
Maya?  What do you mean?
It's useless...look at him.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
What are you talking about?
Okay.
Are you okay?
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
I can take it.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Careful.
Hello.
I don't wanna see that.
That too tight?
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
And he's fine, girl.
You do.
Yeah, right.
They ever love you back?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
I know.  But chances are...
You shoot like a girl.
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up, Sidra.
Just not my type, I guess.
You do act different.
What do I have to do?
I don't like flowers.
So?
I don't.
He ain't Spalding.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Kiss my booty.
She understands.
Quincy...
What the hell's going on?
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
We won the championship.
Funny.  I never did.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Cause I don't get it.
What?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
And what happens when you lose?
Hey, girl.
Zeke.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
You scared me.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
What's Mom think?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
And some things should never fucking happen!
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Your teeth are straight.
You ok?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
It's a helluva disease.
Yeah, hey. Chad.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
baby, please, please --
Yeah, but I don't know --
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Who was it?
What are you lookin' for?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Let's make a deal.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Diet Coke.
-- what kind?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
Son, don't --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Stay that way.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Gently, son --
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
Braces.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
Yeah.
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
I've seen it before.
...cocksucker....
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
Let's talk about --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
Are you close?
people die.
...this close...
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
He's in here.
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
He's in here --?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
...ok...
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
No.
...you know...
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Are you ok?
You want her right now?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Come home soon after the show.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
No.  No.
Will that help?
Well maybe.
I don't know what I've done.
Hello?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Where will the money go?
You need to sober up.
Linda --
mmmhmm.
Phone number.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
I need this one.
Hi.
Hi.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
It can.  I know the way.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
He who is not with us is against us.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
Poor Phillippe!
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Coming?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
Do I look all right?
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
But -- are you sure?
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
Recent hours have been a shock.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
What is that?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
I decided it this morning.
A personal nature?
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
Silence!  I order you!
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
What number, on the first page?
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Sire, I --
... Nothing.
So what?
What the hell happened?
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Alright, where is she?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
I was just having a little fun -
Yeah?
Who is it?
Speak of the devil.
So where are you from?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
What happened with the tape?
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
I've got a better idea...
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
You must be going somewhere.
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
Could he handle a direct contact?
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
Where?
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
As long as they're dead...
The mark? Yes.
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Where the hell's Graham!
In eight days.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
That was nice of you to think of that.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I'll see you later. All right?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
No. I don't want to see you.
'No' what?
Not me.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
You will tell the truth?
Come in.
Do you have it?
Do you know something about that?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
What's average?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What about the dog?
If I were?
Molly?
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
That's interesting.
Yes. I'd considered it.
I want your opinion.
No.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Why does it feel good?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
Those are my terms.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
What, you don't think I can beat him?
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
So how can I help you...?
So who's gonna pay for it?
I can't move my arm.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Andy!
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Andy, the theater's that way!
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
It's me.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Have you told your family?
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.
Give me the book.
I was very original!
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
What's in Memphis?
Bob.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
You don't know.
Oh shit.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Did you hear that?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
He had an accident.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Hello?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
This can't be...
What are you doing?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
And she's never wrong.
What do you believe in?
That's why we're here.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Morpheus, I don't know --
How is he?
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
What the hell is this?!
That's different.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
Go!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
They're hacking his mind.
Why?
Which way?  Which way?
Operator.
What just happened?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
No, all we got is $40.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Next time, bet with your own kind.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Hey...you got nothing here.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Don't you move!!!
Back so soon.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
OK, ok...
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Oh Michael, look...
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
How much?
How much was the original loan again?
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Hey, where you been?
Wha?
What is it now?
Did you?
A paper on that one too?
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Hey... you got stereo.
Well...no.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
That's your name?
Dinner?  Again?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Paillarde of veal.
Honey --!
Yeah, but --
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
I didn't say.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
It doesn't matter.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
A voice?
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Did you just hear something?
Like a marriage made in heaven?
As close as a deal could be.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Have we met?
I don't care.
Yours.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
And what do I get?
You get not to go to jail.
Yeah.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
No, no.  I on holiday.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
How long you here, Joe?
You think so?  How do you know?
What are you doing here?
I'm lost.
Joe --
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
Why?
Girlfriend?
I'm sorry about --
He's taking a nap.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Don't.  That will come later.
Will it?
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'.
The 'coffee shop' --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
Yes?
Of course.
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
What way would you put it?
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Thanks.
I was just asking, Bill.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
You're what?
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Then what is it?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
And we're very grateful.
An offense --
You are --?
You want me to be your guide --?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Of course.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Are you giving me orders?
Please.  Talk to me --
Where are you?
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
'Take me'...?  Where?
Time.
Yes what?
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Aw, you're tough.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Where's Joe?
Where is he?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
I love you, Daddy --
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
Burt.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
So you're holding my calls?
Why?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Yeah.
Have I told you what this man did?				*
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Did you?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Kill him.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
Shut your mouth!
What the hell you want to go there for?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Natalie? Natalie who?
Prove it.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
It is now.
* Thank you.							    *
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
No.  I was in Namibia...
We know these people...!
And...?
With Sonny.  110%.
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
Yes you do...
What do you like to drink?
Were you born in Havana?
Died in childbirth, having me...
That's right.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
What friend?
Anything?
No.
Verdado.
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
Hello?
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Control your men.
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Then what were we talking to you for?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
What you gonna do back there, East?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
You like it? Take a look.
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
You're what?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Thanks, Joe.
The kids? Why are they...
History, man, history. How much?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Shit.
How far?
No, I'm not afraid.
Just what?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
How's it feel?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
And?
You got your stuff?
Okay?
What time is it?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Hishradyo.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Lady...
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
Did you see the size of that thing?!
What?
Wait a minute-
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
The kid...
What do you-?
My God, what the hell are you...?
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Honey, just leave it.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
This wing configuration. I've never...
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Will I be able to walk?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
I don't have a title yet.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
The profanity bothers you?
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
You want me to burn my book?
No big deal.
I don't know.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
No, just the paper will be fine.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
I'm telling you, I can't.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
You really think so?
What?
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Yes.
People sure like those Misery books.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Buster.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Well that depends.
You picked another winner!
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
How're we doin', then?
What are you doing here?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- torque wrench.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Damn, you're beautiful.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
And that's the only reason?
Much.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
-- his left jacket pocket.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.  Should I?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Only four more cars.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Is he serious?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
You were in the car!
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Max made a deal with you?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
You're sure about this?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
May I come in?
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
What are you going to do?
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
This is Kittridge.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Yes.  I see your point.
I don't quite follow you.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
What are we downloading?
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Why should I?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
What was your deal with Job?
What sector's the air conditioning?
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Claire.
Give me the God damn gum.
The package is in the open.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
I thought I was going to see Max.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Sure.  If the main character does.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
- and picked us up in the States -
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
You got it.
And get a doctor.
Jack you're so wicked.
Such a nice ass.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Ti amo.
You look tired.
I got it done.
Oh, Cosmo!
Why didn't he call himself?
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Fast.
Instantaneous.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
How many men since then?
What are you doing!
I was dead.
Loretta.
I've got you.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
It's so bright.
She didn't like me.
Why not?
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
For what?
I'm here!
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Maybe you're right.
You never have dessert.
What?
Yes?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Will you live here?
Why not?
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Everything's different.
Oh.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I know.
I don't know.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Do you have a girlfriend?
What do you do?
That woman was a student of yours?
Why do men chase women?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
May I walk with you a ways?
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
My God, it's a mansion!
Is who down there?
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
You don't vote for kings.
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
One that looks nice.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
I move for no man.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Hello.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
It is the rabbit.
Man!
Be quiet!
Bloody peasant! 
I think I'll go for a walk.
What is your quest?
Blue.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Don't be such a baby.
Who's that then?
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
I think I could pull through, sir.
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
But, Mother ...
Father, lad.
I don't want land.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
And make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Well ... yes ...
Hurry!
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
How about yourself?
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
Aye, but will they?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll be worried about me.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
You watch your tongue.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You know nothing about her!
Mary Taylor, sir.
Checked and locked, sir.
Good man.  And is she all right?
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
Oh.
Was there never ambition?
Aye.
Too busy looking after themselves.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
Yes, ma'am?
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
Should we take it seriously?
So?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
Just them?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
Well?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Read it.
Who told them that?
I have a letter, ma'am.
Where is my son?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
What is the matter with him?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
But how can it change every time?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Yeah...
Can you turn off the game?
Because I didn't know where else to go.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
What are you looking for?
Yes I am...
What?
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
I'm thinking!
Mom?  You're alive...
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
It means she's screwed up.
I'm going home Cynthia.
And?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
So what's the problem?
I'll speak to someone.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Okay.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
It's unbelievable!
Wow!
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
What do you mean?
Unh, unh.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Maybe it's not me.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"Really?"
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Good luck!
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Don't stop!
Do you know them?!
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
Wally Brown.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Where at?
No...
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
So what do we do ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Where are we going ?
I don't get it.
Do you know where you're going ?
What about you ?
What are you DOING here ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
What's next Walt ?
Be very, very quiet...
You okay ?
Knock yourself out.
Stop the hydraulics.
Trust is earned not given away.
So ?
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
What did you hear ?
Then what do you want ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
We can't afford too many surprises.
<<belch>>
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Not now, Mom.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
Are you okay ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
He was right behind me !
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
Why don't you shut up now.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
THANK YOU.
What about giving the other guy a break.
So, what's on your mind?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Thanks, I needed that.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
If I eat it I'll throw up.
No.
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Thanks.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
More than anything in the world.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
My mother can't have any more kids.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Then what did she do?
Is it okay if I drink this?
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Your mother?
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
Thanks....
He said it was a gift.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
Change my name.
Just come and get it...right here!
...I dropped it.
My mother stood on this very spot.
Hey look!
Right.
Yeah?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
She'll be all right baby.
I was commenting on your hair.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Something wrong?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
He's so tiny.
Beidermeyer?
Good for you baby.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Can't you see it?
Deceased.
I need the job.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
It's no big deal.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Oh, how do you mean?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad??
Why?
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
When?
When??
I like the freak show.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
I wrote a poem too.
No....
Does he love her?
Really?
I like my name.
NO!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I think it should be outlawed.
No, I'm going home.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
It's a mosquito bite.
If I do it, can we go?
Is that your Dad?
Who's that with your Dad?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
Don't DO that!!
THIS!! 
What do you want it for anyway?
Why are you running away?
Then go home, baby.
You don't miss much.
Kindred spirits.
You've been working on this, huh?
Impressive.
The man you love.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
Excuse me?
Which was the disqualifying factor?
Don't you have to be somewh...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
Does that make it right...
Thank God you were here.
Lower.
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Well, if that's the way you f...
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Am I disturbing you?
What did you say your name was?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Third party?
Barbara Jean.
That's what he wants.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Well, Mr. Green.
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
You must really like him.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Nash.
Oh... Well.
The car broke down.
I feel really good.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
How long have you been with them?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
I'm here.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Oh.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
You know who that is?
Hello.
You know Bill is really mad at you.
We just got a gold record.
Come on back to bed.
Hi.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Oh --
Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
You think it will?
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Yes you are.
What did you think then?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Sorry about that.
Do you miss Mallory?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
I could go for a Coke.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
Yeah baby.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Through the power of the simple word---
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
How immediate is immediately?
And where do you keep Mickey?
What the hell happened to you?
Lose 'em.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
See Duff. He's the money man.
Okay.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
No. You got the wrong idea.
Guess I don't.
Have anything in mind?
How d'you mean?
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
You almost got into trouble back there.
No, on the porch.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
What d'you mean?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Hi.
I'll have some coffee, please.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Don't, Duff.
We can always do that, Duff.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
Day work.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Where' you goin'?
We was just leavin', fellows.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
No. Why?
He's your son.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
I'm still on my honeymoon.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
You're hurt...
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Easy...
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Prepping your trip.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
She's ready to go.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
It'll flatline your ass.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You haven't got it?
And we really do have to talk.
I had to limit your options.
What's my end?
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
I gotta know... did it work>
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
What the fuck... are you serious?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
A regular Fagan.
Yeah... fine.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Shit...
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
What?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh, man! Who told?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Anita!
Anita, remember espadrilles?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Cuuuute!
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
But I don't want it straightened out.
He's my teacher!
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Are mom and dad here?
Is that true?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Sure, why?
You remember that story?
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
You were attracted to me?
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
I'm sorry...
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
What?
How come?
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Are you okay.
Are you sure?
Whoa!
yeah, I had a bad night.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Hi, Kerry.
Hi Mom.
What?
Wait and see.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
You like gymnastics?
That was different.
Are you okay?
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
What?
What are these, beauty marks?
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Crossed over?
Oh God.
You're late.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Stop blaming yourself.
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
You sound like Peter Pan.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Who is he?
A sad choice.
Freddy.
We're here.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No.
Thank you.
I forgot my bag.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Okay -- fine.
That's fine.
I thought you were leaving.
Nothing.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Eleven.
My son's name is Johnny?
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Okay.
Wow.
You were saying...
Yes.
Where are you going?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
That's nice.
Is this your first film?
By the way -- it's you.
Me?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
What happened?
What do you think?  Good move?
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Martin -- your customer.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
I wouldn't go outside.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Excuse me.
What?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
And yet you suspect her.
Would you like to start?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Get up, Billy.
Will you come with me, please.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Sorry to have bothered you.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Oh, I had them removed.
Yeah?
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
A vote is before the group.
So do I!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Mister McMurphy.
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
Good. Why don't you join us?
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
No.
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
What for?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
It doesn't help him.
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Hit me!
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Yeah, Mac?
I wanna go home!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Oh, what was that?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
How much ya wanna bet?
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Yes, I see it! I see it!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
What happened?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Of course not.
No, really.  What's she doing?
Who's dying?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Who's this?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
I'm in love with you.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Tell me.
Mickey Spillane.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Why are you doing this?
So were you.
How about music?  You like classical?
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I know the feeling.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Well, to-- new friends.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
No.  He smokes.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Is he married?
No.
No.  He's never asked me.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
You don't have a passport.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
That was a long time ago.
Sure you did.
He's heeeeeerrre...
So, you've had a little bad luck.
I know, but...
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Kate is that you?
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
It's siesta.
How old are you?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
I could have been better!
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
They're waiting for him to walk in.
None of your business.
I'll get home all right now.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
I can get home all right from here—
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
I don't know.
How do you like it?
I don't rate it.
Edie... Edie... ..
What I did to Joey.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
About Edie?
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
D 'n D?
What do you think?
Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
Such as what?
I'm just resting my feet.
Better.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—
So-so, Johnny.
Count this.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
I'm so frightened.
The ropes are coming loose.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
...And what is this?
A symbol, Master.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The time...is short.
You may take her now.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Yes, it is.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
Did you know that when you married him?
Till they got busted.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
You did work for Emil, right?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
You at least bring the gun?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
I get that feeling, yeah.
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Sure, Daniel.
You're gonna use a ram?
Leave it where it is.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Hello?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
The fuck you talking about?
Not until recently.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
That's funny.
You don't seem all that scared.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You know who this is?
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
It smelled.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
Oh, God...
So.  What's your point?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
I thought you guys were busted.
Looks like tonight.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Have they got Midge up there?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
You gonna write me a check?
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
What's going on, Glenn?
I'm freezing my ass off.
Really?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
Thank you...
Faux goose down.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Do you always stutter?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Yeah.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
You hear my okay?
It's shorter than our practice runway.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
Danny...
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Sorry.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
What?...
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
What's the matter?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
Charlie...
You drive like a maniac!
I thought it had a lot of merit.
I'm sorry Charlie.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
What're you doing here?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I love you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
But I'm remembering the future.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
What're you doing here anyway?
This is great reefer.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Damn that Charlie I
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Oh no!
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
For what?
Maddy's party.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Don't eat the red ones.
What's up?
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
What's that?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
What's the matter?
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
I hear you moved into town.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How long ago did this guy retire?
Who was that?
Hey! Where're you off to?
He pissed me off.
Is this a good spot?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
How did it go with your father last night?
I know, Mom.
Do you really think so, Andy?
One hour!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
That's not what I said.
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm ready...
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
About my blood work?
Innocuous?
Client of yours?
Nine.
Continue.
What do you want?
Beckett?
What?
Except... you were gay?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Some do. I didn't.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Hello?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Objection!
Objection!
Leave that.
A homosexual encounter.
Get real.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Good school. What year?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Lots.
Don't know, Joe.
Joe?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Not when I was in the Navy.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Bring the light!
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
What do you see? Riddick?
Get out of our way.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
What, you're afraid?
They're already dead. Get on board.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
S'matter?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Little ratty-ass.
He can pilot?
Dancin' on razor blades here...
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
You know who Muhammad was?
What?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
So much for your nightfall.
Dr. Zaius --
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
How did it go?
Which direction?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
If only we could get a fix.
Why special?
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
How so?
With one of them.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
What about it?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Yes.
It's humiliating.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
You lame Taylor?
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Must be somebody?
What we got here a crusader?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Indefinitely?
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Dance?
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
How did you meet him?
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Cold?
Is this the best you can do?
I didn't notice him.
You don't know who he is?
Why?
Anything I can do about it?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
Well?
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Wonder what?
That, and the fun of it.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
I don't want to talk.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Got it on you?
Martini.
What's this in favor of?
Thank you.
Where?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
I don't.
I never notice the view after the first week.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
It could have been an accident.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
What are you doing here?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Floater?
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Do I know who lives down there?
Pretty big chance, huh?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
Well.  What about it?
I never saw it before.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
No doubt about that one.
He checks too.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
So-so.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
I have a rough idea.
What's this?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
I will, thanks.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
It's terribly good.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
Very thoughtful.
Me too.
Might?
What did he want?
To the airlift.
To the Fleet.
Oh yes.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
What period?
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
No.
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
You first!
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
Babes.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
They took a left at the next light!
What do you want?
People are expendable to Bodhi.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
No way, old buddy.
Like the old days, Dillon.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
You're wastin' your time.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Any sign of the hostages?
You're looking well, Dutch.
He's not really my uncle.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Congratulations, sir.
You've got a lot of nerve.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
That's ridiculous.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
You're joking.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Off the boulevard.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
You really are a very beautiful girl.
No?  Why's that?
Vivian --
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
Was someone rude to you?
You always been rich?
No.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
You won't.
Huh?
Did you?
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
What!?
What time's diner tonight?
We just did.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Did I wake you?
Carlos had some great rock.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Yeah.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Yeah, what?
You bullshittin' me?
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I leave extras, miss.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
But I always eat like this.
They will serve salad.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Yes?
Do you remember me?
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
We'll never survive.
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
It never happened.
Did you say, "I do"?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
You're quick.
And a good thing too.
Faster!
He's really very short on charm.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
-- where?
Where did you get that?
Inigo.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Yellin.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
And our assets?
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
-- all that I have and more please --
Sir. Sir.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
How old were you?
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
You're that smart?
Inhale this, but do not touch.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Think it'll work?
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,

Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
What do you mean?
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Maybe you're happy.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
What is she gonna do here?
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Max, I...
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
Really, I never dreamed ...
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Always.
Get car.  Get car.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Of Siegfried...

"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
I mean in show business.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
No.
Tell me all about her.
Very early. Dawn.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
She isn't still here, is she?
Not at all!
Someone is sitting in that window.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Let's all talk about Mary.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Casharoonie!
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
How much?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
What difference does that...
I'm Mary's sister.
Is something wrong?
A good reason, I suppose.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Stay here.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Watch your tenses.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
What makes you sound so certain?
Sorry.
What?
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I have to go, Sam.
I can come down next week.
No.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
I'm thinking of it.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Don't miss your plane.
I'd like to.
I imagine so.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Norman.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Alright, Miss... 
In quite a hurry.
Then I'm free to go...?
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Was that all?
No mother.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
You--a friend to me?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
What are you laughing at?
Did you? Where?
Why didn't you eat last night?
That's the way I feel about it.
We'll be coming to the opening.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
The body of Joan Gale!
What do you think I am?
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Meaning what?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Do you know George Winton?
That's the one.
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Cry-baby?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Could be.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Well, I got to see her.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Five hundred rabbits?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
They're discussing it.
What are they doing?
He had his hand on her titty.
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
What?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
What did you forget?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
You don't know where you're going?
Is this ill right?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Yes, dear, what is it?
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Never again, never again...
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
What'd I say?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Relax.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
Gimmie a butt.
Happy Independence Day.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
You going rogue on me?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Dead.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
You see that?
They're... around.
But I have no sister.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Luke.
Leia!
Shall we try and go around?
I...
Lando, grab it!
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Good, I hate long waits.
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Good shot, Red Two.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
We must have a blow-out.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
But it seems so unhealthy here.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You did right.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
What a guy
From Transexual Transylvania.
Now I
Want to come again and stay
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Creature of the night.
...How's the turtle food this week?
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I don't know.
...I suppose.
I don't think you're a bum.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
It's not that --
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
...T-thank you.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Yes.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...What?
Why?
Don't talk like that to him!
What?!
He won't last one round.
...Stop jivin'!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
...Still don't feel no heat.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Of wa?
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Why?
...That's an old one.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Yo' yellow, old man.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Gonna try.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Excuse me.
I'm sure you are.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
'Bout an hour ago.
Don't you care what the people will say?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, Paulie.
Yo, Paulie.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Maybe I better forget it.
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
What was <u>that</u>?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
You?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
Have you got the will?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No, I don't.
Does this help?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Leave Me!
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Out--
Of love?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
I'll not endure him.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Goodnight.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
Amen
What?
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
Do you have it?
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Why did you do that?
So what's the deal?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
What in bloody hell is going on?
I still am.
Is that right?
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
Duty calls?
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Where's the case?
Here's yours.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Then I guess we're set.
Really?
He's tough, your American friend.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Soon.
Is that right?
They call me Swede.
Sorry I'm late...
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Coordinate what?
As in, they own it?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Like Larry or Swede.
So is the woman.
The question still remains: what do we do now?
What's going on?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
You were smoking?
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
You sure your friend got the right place?
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
And now...
You speak French.
You sure?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Seven thousand...
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
What do you mean what are we going to do?
I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
And how do you figure we do that?
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
You're crazy.
How long is it going to take?!
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
I'm all ears.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
No.  Why?
Nothing happened?
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
A satellite dish?
What did he buy?
A week ago, at most.
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Why?
What makes you say that?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Anything...specific?
Shopping here?
Sure.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
I'm not asking.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Is that the mail?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
Are you hungry?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
I'm not getting an answer.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
No, I just assumed...
Winner six!
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Yeah, that's right.
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Oh, you American?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
Those girls drove off because of you.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
Carter?
Not Yu.  You!
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
What?
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
She's getting undressed.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
What is it?
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
Fine with me.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Mind your own business.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Are you serious?
Vegas...
Let's go.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
New York City?
I could use a little vacation.
What's going on?
I need your help.
Master Ching taught me.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Beach Boy.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
-- what the hell is that?
What about them?
Did you make the plate?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
You like it?
I am from outa town.
I'm sorry, Lee.
You're killin' me here.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Ambassador Han.
Han?
I would like one of my people to help.
I am so sorry about your men.
I will not have friends in America.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
See you at the wedding.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
It's hurting.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
In vino veritas.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Yeah.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Thanks.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
How romantic.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
No.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Of course.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Where did you disappear to?
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
That's called changing your mind.
Yes I do!
I'd rather not.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you.  I love you.
So am I.
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
I'm just finishing up, too.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
No.  It's my life.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
What is it?
That doesn't make any sense.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
No.
-- it was a betrayal.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You okay?
What was what?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Right.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
Becky?
Thank you.  I love you.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
What about the letter?
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
What?
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
It's a sign.
Grace heard it.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
All righ...
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
No.
Why not?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I don't know --
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
You'll find out.
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
Eighty dollars.
I don't know.  Do I?
It's never happening again. Right?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
Jed's got cables.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Thank Victoria for dinner.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
Was Mom an adjustment?
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Get out.
Okay.
What about it?
It's a little derivative.
You could have called me --
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Are you sick, Mama?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
What's more important than sanitation?
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
No.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Can be what?
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
This is what we've been waiting for.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
You mean Delaware?
No ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Nothing.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Oh. Hi.
What happened to your eye?
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
And you admire that?
Why not?
Really, I don't want to.
Colette, go.
You on a roll?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
You're going to have to explain that one.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Okay
What?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Come on, guys ...
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Just some buddies.
Thanks for not judging me.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
I thought you'd be happy.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
The Mexicali Boys
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Excuse me?
You mean like the Donner Party?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
Where's Bubba?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
I'd love to hear it.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
I've been humming it.
I wonder where they're going.
Worked, didn't it?
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Nope.
You think they'll be alright?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
What are we going to do?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
There's always a bright side.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
What deal?
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
Don't do that again.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
We know.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
I'll take the whole set.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
You're tough, J-man.
I'll be in my office.
Lloyd, give it up.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Lloyd is doomed.
Wait a minute.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I'll put this past my boss
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Ha!
I won?
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
I'm fine.
Dad, are you okay in there?
What am I supposed to think?
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Alright.
Thank you very much.
Whoa.
That's cool then.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
So what's your job this summer?
Oh.
Me?  Sure I do.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Yeah.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
Yeah.
No, I don't, I don't.
You told your dad?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Then don't do it.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
How do you pay for one of those?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
I know.
Very talented.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
My car.
I don't know.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
What's your name?
Oskar, please -
It's bad business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
What's going on?
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
It kind of looks that way.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
I'll talk to you later.
We know that, son.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
How's the name search going?
thought he was doing AA.
What is it?
Stop it...
Hang up...call...
That's okay.
Why aren't you there?
I'm inquisitive.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Where's Sid?
Yeah.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Two.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
So we found a compromise.
Or it found us.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
..and as lonely as I am...
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Where are you?
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..it's really about family and tradition...
She's not here right now.
I get scared really easy, okay.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Asshole, Can't talk.
What do you mean?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Oh yeah, how?
Detective Kincaid?
The killer called her.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Where are you Dewey?
They found another note?
What's your point?
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Are you saying she was-
Gale he's got Dewey!
Yes.
You're dead!
You rode your bike out there?
Jesus, SHIT!
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
It's been a year since she died.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Uh-huh.
I thought you were...
I don't understand...
Yes.
What number are you trying to reach?
Hello.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Really? What?
Do you like scary movies?
So, you gotta boyfriend?
No...
NOOO!
What?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Afraid not.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Off the record. No cameras.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Hello?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
I heard screaming.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
Jesus, this place is packed.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
And what would be your motive?
Are you serious?
Do you believe this shit?
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Do you really think Billy did it?
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Who?
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
What am I? The beer wench?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
Give it to me.
How's that?
Thank you.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
Have you heard?
It's none of my business anymore.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
What's so exciting?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You didn't know.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
We would have gotten you eventually.
Here he comes.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
No.
Good.
I read.  Remember reading?
No witnesses of any kind?
I know.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Oh, that's all.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
And?
How did the fire fight end?
It is Victor.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
Think about it...
He's preaching.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Throw your gun down now!
Anything... anything missing or different.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
No sir...pleasure.
What good does that do?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Unnt-meah!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Easy on that!
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Think she means for us to follow?
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
They never find that girl.
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
We got two around that age...
I mean the armchair!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Martin, it's not funny!
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Martin, what-
Hello.  Can I help you?
We should leave the past alone.
Do you know that house?
Never!
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
What is the chief part?
The title?
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
A woman of property?
It's a comedy.
A share of the profits.
Oh, that.
No Juliet?!
It is all locked safe in here
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
I feel a scene coming on.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
The show must … you know
Kit
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
As a nurse.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
"Madam!"
Master Shakespeare
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I have, Master Shakespeare.
But the plague
My lady!
I do not know how to undress a man.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
You never spoke so well of him.
Will you read it for me?
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Nor you for me.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
Good morning, my lord!
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
I . . .
Do you understand me?
Does she say so?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
But what of Lord Wessex?
Is there a man?
Serve.
Just serve.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
He's still here.
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Don't you worry about that.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
Now.
You're sure? There's lots more.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
They know.
Not at all.
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
I don't know them.
Yes, thanks.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Cameron.
Cameron?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
Alex.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
I wonder how he did it?
I'm just looking.
Don't look?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
I refuse.
Everything.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
The perfect couple, I should say.
I see.
It's OK. There's no problem.
Who said there were four?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
I'm sorry.
Who have you talked to?
Eh, I don't know.
What do we do here, David?
Sorry?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
I write about it?
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
No. I haven't seen them.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
I suppose so.
Is it real?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
What're you talking about, George?
Do you think George is a fairy?
That's George.
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I gotta talk to you.
Nummers.
I don't want to place you in any position --
Your husband?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Well she...
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
No.
Her?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
No shit.
That you're just like your mother.
Great.
I went to school with her husband.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Pardon me?
You're late, George.
What!
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I don't know. Probably not.
You don't seem very sure.
... I don't get it done often.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Hey, I don't tell.
Baby...
Look, either come in or stay out!
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
-- we can't now.
Jackie, can we --
-- you are.
That sounds like me.
-- very nice, very nice.
Why?
Why?
Oh yeah?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah, baby...
Yeah.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
I want your feelings about it.
Jill says nothing.
How come you took your own car?
Well that's something.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Oh yeah?
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well... who are those guys?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
I know.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Yes I do.
All right, who're you with? Jill?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Well maybe I can get you something.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
You and your touchy investors.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
That's right.
I am? I mean why?
I know, I'm sorry.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Nothing.
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
I'm exaggerating.
C'mon.
That's right.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Thank you.
No... how long did you say?
No!
Where to, Les?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
No, Dad.
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Yes.
Maybe he showed me something.
What about Room 237?
No I ain't.
Mommy...
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
No.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Sure.
Beg pardon?
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
Yes, I did.
Somebody did that to him.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.
Stay away from me,
I'll bring back a doctor.
They'll love it.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Hi.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
What time does the plane leave?
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Yes. Go away.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
And you listen to that?
What you do?
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
Vince...
You bastard!
No... it's fine.
Sure.
This prom is a real drag.
HE'S SO FINE.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
It's true -- I know her.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Amateurs 2
What?  What time is it?
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Three years.  Sister.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
I'm getting experience.
What?
Don't you know it!
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
St. Anne's?
You were unhappy?
Are you talking about me?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
What's wrong with my life?
I got it.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You're my Olympic event.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
So I don't shop.
No nothing.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
I can't go with you.
Hail, Mary.
You won't even tell us?
It's done?
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
Get her!
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Yes?
He's decent.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
I don't understand.  Where is she?
Yes?
She's a nun, Vince.
She's... she's a nun.
I hit him square.
What is that?
We must be a curious sight to him.
Maybe you should take this.
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Listen to what you say....
What kind of nuts?
We should not go much further in this murk.
Should we go back?
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
Lady Van Tassel.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Are you so superstitious?
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
You promised justice.
They have done nothing of the sort.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
Blood.
My God... what has happened?
And, what did he say?
I have not been able to face him yet.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Yes, actually.
Father saw you die.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
I'll see you, Bill.
Can I help you?
You have any biscuits for sale?
French-fried potaters.
Yeah.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't tell me what to do.
How'd your baptizin' go?
It went real good.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I know Albert. We're friends.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
All right then.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
If you want me to.
So it died when it come out?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I reckon.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
I never was no good with history.
I'll be.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What brings you back?
Yes sir.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Where will he go?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Better make it charge. 
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Jesus, what happened to you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
What's the difference?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Every word.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
You're looking good, Auggie.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Like what?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
I told her she was going to meet her father.
She looks just like you.
Bully for you.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
A little. Not much.
It's for you.
Open it.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
I think I'll take them. 
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
And his parents?
I figured he had a right to know.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Hi there, little brother.
Yeah? Who is it?
Baby? And what baby is that?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Of course. Where else?
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
I don't have much time. 
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
The inspiration.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Yeah, it might be.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Yeah, I picked it up.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
A thousand.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
You don't believe in God anymore.
And the next one...?
And the last...?
Did you say more?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
Cigarette?
What makes you think I play?
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
It is.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Get lost, will you?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
You mean it's a girls' band?
They got the bull-fiddle.
Where are we running, Joe?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Good night, Daphne.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
I am.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
What'll I tell him?
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Oh - Sugar!
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
What did you say?
How's the bottle?
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
What's that?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
Yes.  For a whole year.
I was it.
What's wrong with us?
- you got to be blonde -
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Why?
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
Yes, Joe.
No, we couldn't!
Where did he conduct?
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Afford it?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Yeah.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Want to switch berths with me?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I don't think so.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
How's the stock market?
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
You heard her - yes.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
What else is there for me? 
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Would you do me a favor?
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Good morning.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
I cut myself shaving.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Thanks, Charlie.
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
I don’t think I can go through with this.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
Still--
Or Kat....
And Kat was fully clothed.
Hey, man.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
What?
It’s cute.
I guess so.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
Hi.
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You want me to let him in?
So why’d you let him go?
You don't live around here, do you?
Uh huh...
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Colored.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
But, Charlie --
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
It was too dark, Daddy.
You bet we is!
David!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Any sign of Sounder?
No mam -- I looked all over.
Can't sleep?
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Whatcha got there?
Is he gon' be gone long?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
What?
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Mom...
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Thank God, that sucked ass.
I don't know.
Hello there, children!!
Purpre mama!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Yes I am!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Mph rmph rm!
Aw, ma!!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
And Bill?
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Hello, Conan!
Fight the power!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Don't call me dumb!
Hey, relax guy!
What if I just left?
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Hi Wendy.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Check.
Oh Sara...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Where the hell did you come from?
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
What did you say to me?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Break it down to me, what's going on?
That's clear.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
We don't.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
I don't know what we're facing.
Yeah?
Take this flare.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
We have room!  Let's go!
Will you marry me?
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
I guess so.
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
What kind of man?
The pin machine?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Sure, Sid.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
I'm not on the tour this year.
That game was before you was born.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
What the fuck is this?
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
He's the guy Buzz.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It depends.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Who's there?
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
After we eat, Dad.
Fantastic! What talent.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Grasp firmly. Then what?
I'm a bowler.
Won't your father help you with that?
The mental hospital.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
What's plan B?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
What are you going to do about your brother?
You're here.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
Why should I help that old fuck.
Zip.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
You should.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
I am a professional man.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Some unfinished business.
Very good, busyboy.
There's heat coming the door.
Wait a minute --
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Norman!
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Direction's east coming!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Storm?  What storm?
How deep is he?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Hold on --
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
You don't want to know.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Edmunds?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
I did.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
I'd also like it noted --
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
Look at this.
We had considered it.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
To what?
Edmunds?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
You're next, Norman.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Beth --
Beth --
It's not worth the risk.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Manifested?
He translated it wrong.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
How long does it last?
Three to six hours.
Doesn't say.
What's wrong, Norman?
You think I'd really drink that?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
But --
You're insane.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Stop it!
Beth?
I --
Top shelf, is it?
You hear that?
Pussy.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Where's it coming from?
This answers one of our questions.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
What happened to her?
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
You know how to work this thing?
There is one possibility.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Norman Johnson.
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
No, they didn't say --
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
What report?
Huh?
Who's everyone?
You want me to try?
You mean a picture?
Please, Ted.
What was it?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Was it a military crash?
The Empire must have gotten here first.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
How can you store an energy field within you?
That's where my father was killed.
Are you sure you don't need it?
Yes, sir.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Who's the pilot?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Why didn't you say so before.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Is he afraid of the water?
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
No need, everything's under control.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
They'll find its weakness.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Mobile Infantery rules !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, no, sir.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
What's the hurry ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
They revoke our flight status.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Eeuch !
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Zander is going for pilot, too.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Where'd it come from ?
What ?
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
Good good, then it's all settled.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Well, yeah, sure...
Hi, mom.
Can you walk ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Kill the bitch.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
The examination is a normal function.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
By the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
You saved the ship.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're losing the pattern...!
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Why?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
Yes.
...such a pleasant sound.
...who...?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
No, I don't...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Cast stood me up.
What?
...lost the screw...
The other side.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You can do it.
Sure did.
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
You know what else a man can do?
Sleep well?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
What is it all about?
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Hi!
I wasn't doing business.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Who is this person that you've found?
No.  Don't tell me that.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
It'll hurt the box office.
Wat...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Waterford, Vermont.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
This horse is booked.
They think it's your First Wife...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
Isn't he...
The prices are going up.
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
You guys had better leave us a...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
There's other things to be learned.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
She's absolutely r...
But we...
Yeah.
What...?
I can't do it, Walt.
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I know...I know...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
-- she's got 'religion.'
You said <u>three</u>...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
I have to talk to you.
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
He told you that...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
A witness to what...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
What's the...
I...
No.
What did you say to them...?
Pay her off.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
He's got a gift for fiction.
Yeah?
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Why?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I don't care.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Like who?
It just slipped out.
It happens.
I could help with the debate.
Actually.  I could only help him.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
You lost Ben?!
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Why don't you say hello?
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Help me here...
In high school.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
I hate her.  I really hate her.
No they're not.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Queen of diamonds.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Okay.  These are good.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Easy enough.
Called him.  We set an ap...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
What did you do?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
So why did y...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
I don't know wh...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Can I look at the pictures?
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
You weren't passing 'em out.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
No, there isn't.
Why didn't I?
What do I have that you don't?
For what?
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
No problem.
Well, they will be.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
That's not us.
Where you goin'?
Maybe he's gay.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Hey.
No prob. I'm cool.
He was in a concentration camp?
Must've been hard being poor.
My baby.
Jesus was not bad.
So whaddya think?
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Yes, Mikey?
Was anyone in my room today?
I can read it to you.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
What DO you know?
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
That's good.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Nigger.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Great!
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
I do.
Three.
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
You a pervert?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Prnceton.
Can I see what you have so far?
What is most important to you?
He did?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Is he with the girl?
Forget about it.
What happened?
Well Cooper...
I have a lighter!
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Are the labs in operation?
Come on, drink up.
I don't want any...
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
If I don't get power up we are!
Drop the anchor!
Get your men to do it!
What does that mean?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Where is this...thing?
Give that back to me.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
What?
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
That's government property, Major.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
General Schmuck?
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
A shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
That's right, sir.
Plan-R????
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Right.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Do you think we'd cheat?
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
Then there's no chance for recall?
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Roger, maintain.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Then this is it.
Check.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
That's what I said.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
You tell me.
I'm okay.  What's up?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Let me check.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Uh-huh.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Hey!
Right now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
It's your birthday?
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Sorry.
Ah!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, no.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
What, they're looking for her?
Guess not.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Your his publicist?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Buff.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
You better! Yes!
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Please.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You could do it.
Thanks, man!
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Yes.
What'd he get you?
What about me? I don't have a car.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
What was your name again?
Erica.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Um, mother-daughter.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
No.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
No.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
About what?
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Yeah.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Nothing.
No, I don't.
You do.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Jeff!
Where are you going?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Sorry.
Now?
What do you mean?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
I hope you're happy!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Hey!
Is that your driver?
Look at you!
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
You do?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Your manager?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
No car.
Sorry, Kansas...
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Another sex dream?
Hello?
Positive.
Spit from your dad?
I sure do.
Trix...
Jack, I think I should get a job.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Yeah?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
You did?
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
You're tough, all right.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Nice job.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Yes, I did.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
What's the matter, Norma?
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
Get out.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Yeah?
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
December twenty-first.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Hold me tighter.
"Mad about the boy."
What's the matter with you?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
I ran into some people I knew.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
That's a lie!  They still want me!
This room has not been used for a long time.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Good.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
A Storm Dragon?
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
At last. Ultimate Power.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
Wait...don't leave me in here...
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
No.
Away. From you.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Why the empty cage?
Why George, are you proposing?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
What about my proposal?
Theories?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Yes.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
What are you making:
I don't understand.
I can do that.
I'd rather not talk about it.
But what for?
Your hair looks the same.
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
Nigel, get lost.
What is this place?
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
It's lovely. . .
You look at them? How?
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Yeah? What do you want?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Tuesday.
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Brad?
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You know what's the problem?
But Lana, you could --
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I can never get a way from it.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Say!
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
What kind?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
How many sugars?
Man, what is this?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Which country?
Columbia.
Wipe 'em out?
Hey, boss.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Can you do that?
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
What about you?
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Okay? Goodbye.
85,000 dollars.
A normal person.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Actually, yes.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Maybe you wanted to.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Hi.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
A parka.
Wrong.
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Why?
Shhhhhhh!
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Impossible? Why?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
An angle?
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
What I need this for?
I'm not going anywhere.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
It was hot, yes.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
No.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Stop him, Clark!
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Is that what they're calling him?
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Oh.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
This??
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
No! You couldn't imagine -
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
It must feel great.
What's the matter, Otis?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
It is for me.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
Of time, Luthor.
Luthor  --
What happened?
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
So what brings you out tonight?
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
Because I have to.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
And what's that?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
What's vermin again?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
That's the local bar?
Here we go.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Yes.
Yes.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Are you expensive?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Very slick.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
There's talk of that.
Will you mind your own business!
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
No, I wouldn't...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Can I come out?  No.
I know Manny Davis.
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
He means that much to you...?
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Talk to her, Sidney...
What about?
Could this be that boy?
I don't think so.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
J.J., if you think -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
I can't
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Where we going?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
That is one of my mission parameters.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
John, get out of the way!!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Why attack Russia?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
What museum?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Your mother, too.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
Did you call someone you knew?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
May I ask a question?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I was warned.
Who warned you?
What did Goering say?
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Okay, so what is it?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Thanks a lot.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
And who was the enemy?
Why were the other two women killed?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Same shit.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Projections were far too optimistic.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
Clean out your locker.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
It was a gift... from my brother.
If there was one.
Where are we going?
A fresh shirt...
Goodnight.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
What are you doing here?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Wha... ?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Where'd you get that... ?
... what... ?
Stop talking to them!
Shut up!
I didn't know what else to call you.
Yes.
They'll be wanting it back.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
What are you doing?
What have they been doing to you?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Do you know how to change a tire?
Robbed?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I'll call.  I really will.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
What's all this for?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
You know, these fit... perfectly.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Thank you.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Anything wrong... ?
You know you can.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
You're not telling us something.
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
All night?
You used the wrong test.
Nell!
And that will be a good place to end this study.
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
Nell!  What's wrong?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Yes.
Are you coming to confess?
I don't know.
Someone is playing with you.
You know what he's really upset about?
This is where we're going?
Maybe they're Mary's.
Get a blanket!
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
Maybe you did it yourself.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
I think so.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Not for you, clearly.
Am I a thing?
Like you.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Y'what?
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
That was one of them?
I've been wondering something.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Nah, accommodation address.
I bet.
Right.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Are you serious.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Tell us about it.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
It didn't discourage you, though.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
Where is he now?
Yeah?
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
I would have preferred staying home, me.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
How much.
Good luck.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
There is?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
I don't get it.
Exercising my visitation rights.
You know I don't live with him.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
But more or less.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
...she can go up there.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Sure.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
That'll be fine.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
...Oh, Jesus.
Your place?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...What kind of man *are* you?
What kind of man *are* you?
Just coffee.
Told what?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Honey.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
Honey...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Taking it seriously.
...So, uh, who should I--
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
What the--
OK.
...Nah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Anything missin'?
Why not?
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
Forget it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
What doors?
What's left of it.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
What are they?
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
We will.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
Big as a house.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
What?
That's impossible.
And John?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
You were going to be married.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
You're not.  Where is it?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
What?
<i>A month.</i>
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
That's right.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
We're not watching the sea.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
That's right.  Lauren.
Yeah?  Outta what?
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I told you I can't.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
Let's go now.
Truman, what about that sign?
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
When you get to Fiji?
Now what?
Is there any way around?
Well, thank you for your help.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
Working with?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Of what?
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Who?
You looking for him for some other reason?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Do I know you?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
A plague?
That would be my guess.
I've been using you?!
No. I haven't.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Something's not right...
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
You said you weren't coming?
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
-- of what exactly?!
Yeah, well they may this one.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
What? What's wrong?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
I can't go any farther.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
What are you doing?
Where's Scully?
Is she alive?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
...give a kiss to Edward.
There's always a chance they'll confess.
What then?
Agent Novak?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
No problem.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
What's wrong?
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Awaiting his arrival.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Give her some cigarettes.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
What's she talking about?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
We're both in it, Harry.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's go away.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
...again.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
How do you know?
...anyway?
They're Harry's.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
No.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
I don't know.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Holly Martins.
What are you trying to say?
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Well?...
No.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Very good, sir.
Zane Grey.
Yes.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
You saw it?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Funny?
Help you out?
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Bonjour.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Why?
So?
What!
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Francoise -
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
Watch your language....
They only kill them when they love them?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
What do you think you're doing?
Who the fuck are you?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
What, do you like it here?
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Are they still together?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Who's Linda?
What's it mean?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
V'asitem...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Don't curse in front of it.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Notice? Like what...?
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
So you're saying it's not true.
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
I always won.
I can't help what I think.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
I can't say that.
Daniel Balint.
How have things been going?
Fine.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Hello...?
You could do it.
What is it?
Not too fast.
JTS...?
Are you an artist?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
And what did you do?
What are you trying to say?
It's Friday....
"Do chickens give milk?"
Howard Stern.
We tested the new bomb.
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Are you out of your mind?!
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Yes.
Did the driver really freeze?
The documents are forged.
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
You're right.  You're fired.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Is it a poem?
Because you'd laugh.
He can learn.  He is learning.
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Ten thousand.
Have the car painted.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Yes, I know.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
No!  I would never cheat you.
I recognize you.
I don't know... why?
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Why?
Hello?
How are you?
Jacques...?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
You called the police?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
So, now what?
What!?
Keep going.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
We do!
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Mmm———yes.
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
You really think so, Charlie?
What do you want to see him for?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Who?
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
That's right, of course.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
Why?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
I don't know.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
That was unfortunate.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
State hunters?
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
We stood here once before.
It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Must it?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
That’s right.
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
I found this at your brother’s.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Mr Lombard...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Something like that.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
To get me killed...?
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
Get to the point, will you...
So you did talk about it, huh?
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
I’m calling about the puppies.
Why?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
So, what are you looking for?
Where is the Austrian?
Who are you?
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
Who’s the money man?
What company?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
What happens now?
Where is Friedman?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Who else knows about the boy?
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
No...
Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
They lost their son. Why?
Cost what?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Who do they think I am?!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Yes...
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
No, but...
Will you at least let me stay with you?
I am ready now...
I don't remember.  Maybe.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
Who are you?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
Please... may I have it back...
You really think she's been sent... by God?
Go on to the next question.
5,000 gold crowns.
That's not a lot.
Wait, wait...
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
We need another ten minutes...
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
This is no good!
And... what does Jeanne think?
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
No...!
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
What have you done to me?
I might ask you the same question.
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
My... visions...
They won't come anyway.
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Him?
Who is this "he"?
He never says his name.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Let me see this.
I'll be fine.
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
What?
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Who told you?
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
Otherwise what?
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
So, what's the news?
Wladek! How are you?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
I am... I was a pianist.
Szpilman.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Ohh the tag is broken.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
I don't want to learn.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
Everyone has to practice.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
She says, throw the piano overboard.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
Play a gig.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
You're late.  Where you been?
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
What do ya want the others to get?
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
How ya doin'?
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
But I got a train to make.
What does this guy want?
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
So could Shaw.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
Get on with it then.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
What's your next step, Nick?
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
And don't ever try to see me again.
I didn't.
Oh!
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
Where did you get this gun?
Dead?
Forgive me.  How are you?
How's your brother?
But it isn't bad weather now.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
Have you got a pistol permit?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
Chris!
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Well, let me do that for you.
But what if you need more money?
How are you?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
What do you think?
Yes.
No.
Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
There's one coming.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Not with all your money!
What do you mean?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Got a nice evening dress?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Yes.
Trying to put it off on her?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Yes.  Nick!
You his wife?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm sorry...  but...
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
We've got rope?
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
Stop it!
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
What!?  What!?
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You're going to be fine.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Something like that.
Wait.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
Wes might be right about that.
We should head Northeast.
Makes two of us.
Getting cold.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
What do we do?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
The...the gold...
Yeah.
Australia.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
He says it's a box.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
Naw, nothing.
That's in two days.
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Is there anything you do know?
So?
It's got a bottom.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
You know I don't feel well.
Now.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
It's 3+27 hundred
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Good Lord!
I thought you were through with it!
What's going on....what are you doing?
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
I was lost.
How do you know?
We've lost SEN!
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I knew him.
She's not there
Yes.
Yes...
May I help you?
Where are they?
Officer Reilly, vice.
How's the print coming?
What?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
This is where the van was parked.
Which one's which?
Keep talking.
C4, plastic explosive.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
What the hell was that?
You touch me again and--
Prints?
Nothing so far.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
You don't fish.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Make an appointment.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Nice to be here.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Eleven o'clock! 
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
What did you talk about?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Good morning, Major.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
No, not at all!
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
No, thank you.
I like you, Baron.
Right.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
They're all right, aren't they?
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Now, Lily--
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Do you know my first name?
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Good night. 
But attractive--
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Goodbye...
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, m'sieu!
I know!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
I think you'd better go.
I beg your pardon!
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Good luck to you, Rose.
Shit.
Holy shit.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
An accident?!
I was tired.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
How you two doin'?
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
You're distracting me. Go away.
How cold?
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
HELP! HELP!!
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Yes, exactly!
And these were drawn from life?
I don't know the steps.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
I'm so cold.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
You think she was really there?
Is your stateroom alright?
Would you like anything?
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Hope we're not intruding.
Isn't she lovely?
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
No-o!
Guess again, copper.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Sally--!
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Lonesome?
What, again?
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
My change.
Inspector McKinney.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Come in! 
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Why?
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
That's me!
I thought I put you to bed.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Who won?
I was never stiffer in my life.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
Thanks to me.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
That's the truth--every single word!
I'm all right.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
What d'you think of the singer?
Nice voice.
I asked where you got him.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
That's the rumor.
Yeah, you look it.
Age quod agis.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Here, Doc.
What's wrong, Doc?
All right.  Then what?
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Awful lot of money.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
How would you know?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
What can I get you?
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Really?  You sure?
You wanted to talk?
There they are.  No herd though.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
That a fact?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Where can I find him?
- Four wheel drive?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Is that any way to say hello?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
I got you covered.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Boyfriend?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
What?
You are seriously deranged.
This has got to be a mistake.
Not a lot of difference.
Are you listening to me?
If not?
Sleep well?
Stop it!
I am. What do you want?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Who is it?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Will it go off?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
Like muddy waters?
You were in hell?
It was nip and tuck.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Not anymore, not in the city.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Well, it's up to Suzie.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
What, are you having another party?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
Good morning.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hattie is a different person now.
Now who are we talking about?
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Is this your house?
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
You can bring ONE toy...
Woody!  Buzz!
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
What are you doing over there?
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
According to my nava-computer, the --
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Come on, this way!
Yeah, right.
Great!
Miss.  G-6.
What?
What?
Hey!!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
You murdering dog!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
I can't hold on much longer!
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're not so old yourself!
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
I already lost everything once.
Everything is gone, now.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
Victoria -
I appreciate you coming in so early.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
What?
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Is this bad for him?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Private?
How are your grades?
She ain't in on it.
So does half of San Diego.
Are you getting this on tape?
Arizona.
David --
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
When will you do it?
So go shower already.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
I don't think you're going to do that.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
Does this offer include my partner?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Who are these guys?
Bit fucking late, like.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
What?
It's where I live.
Great.
What?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Diane.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
No.
Thanks, Mark.
Now remember --
Another dab?
Lewis Gilbert.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
That's your theory?
It wasn't that bad.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
That's tough.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Yeah.
What?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
With a starship!
The ship....
Sulu, what are you doing?
Position, Bird of Prey?
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
But the shuttle-
Bob?
You caught me on my way to the shower.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
MM.?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Goodnight, Spock.
Not General Korrd.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
You must allow us to act.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock... don't.
I must have your starship.
Who are you?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
No conditions.
He's not?
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Why not?
I don't understand...
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Did you say Group 7 access?
To warn him.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
For sure...
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
That was uncalled-for.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Who is your User, program?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Well, isn't it -- ?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Not us, I hope.
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Thank. you, Master Control.
But-what if I can't...?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
New guy...
Why is everything...like this?
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
I'm done.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Dad, how come you know the words?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Thanks dear.
I thought you moved out.
Station wagon?
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Yes sir.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
They must've just missed me.
What did happen?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
My husband can't know about this.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
I'm sorry, honey.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
I don't take those assignments.
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
And you've got one.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Get going! 
Boris and Doris?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
You can trust me completely.
What is it you want me to do?
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
The forager's back.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
What time is it?
What's your favorite color?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Almost four years.
You know when you sat behind me?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
What?
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Why?
I think what you did...
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Cancoon.
Yeah.
You'd really do that?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
You got it.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
You goin' out?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Do you really mean it?
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
What department?
Yeah?
Don't you?
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
What?
I got some money I can give you -
What about him?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That Vietnam movie?
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
No.
Exactly room-mates.
We want you to tell us about last night.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What's she doing?
Meaning...???
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
You're afraid of germs?
No, 1995 is the past.
What?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
Mason???
We need gas.
What made you think that?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
Give me the gun.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
But you know what's real now?
He was fully sedated!
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Oh, Jesus.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Nothing.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
How much.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
You've been there?
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
What's the matter?
Jake, what is that?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
It's Grace.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Like they're made of polyester.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know how.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Lied?  What do you mean?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
You got a suitcase?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Well, nothing.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Are you all right?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Husband . . .?
What brings you to Sierra?
I had a problem getting my car back.
Nice office you've got.
I was hoping we could talk.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
How much could you get?
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
Jake--
Liar.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Got any requests?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
Oz.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Now, what's this?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
I call the policia.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
I think I've heard that before.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Who the hell are you?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You broke my nose!
Say, what happened to your hand?
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Bobby Cooper.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Live there?
Wait a second--
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would I what?
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
I need thirteen.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
Nothing.
You've been there?
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Wasn't nothing.
You've been around.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Like you.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Nothing.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Is it pretty?
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
The money's right here! Get the key!
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I'm not sailing his boat.
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Bobby? Are you all right?
And I love you too.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Which you don't have.
Heineken?
What was that all about?
Anybody hurt?
Help me, Grace, help...
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
What did I say?
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Are you for real?
Is there a problem?
But not a knife?
Yes.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Just one--
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
You're lying.
Yeah, hello.
Where were you sitting on the train?
Twelve years.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
Where is it?
No?
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Three days. Are you hungry?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Shit and fried eggs.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
No?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Yeah?
You could run off them two cowboys.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Is... is it... loaded?
A sign on him?
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Get some sleep, Kid.
You missed him? You didn't...?
They takin' water?
He's in there.
That was... the first one.
Wha... what f-for?
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
What is it, son?
What?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
See that scrub oak yonder?
He's blind, for Chri...
Say, Ned... ?
Yeah.
We done that stuff.
What was the money for?
Who ?
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They ruined me tonight.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
What the hell do you want?
Tough break.
What-are they speaking?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
Let's say for example -
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
What did you say?
You're lying.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
What do you mean I can't see him?
When does he post bail?
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
He didn't have my lawyer.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
So this lawyer...
Right.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
Yes.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Huh!
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
You've just said you signed it.
It's all right, Mickey.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
Why is that?
She getting good care over there?
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
What?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
I object, your Honor...
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Hello, I'm calling from...
Missus...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
What Hotel are you staying at?
Yes.  It was, actually.
Maybe what?
Why don't you get some rest?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You're talking like a drunk.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
No.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
You use their witness.
...one of the other nurses?
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
... I'm sure you do ...
... I understand ...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Hi.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
Yes.
Another, Frank . . . ?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
As I've said we had some more...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
You don't have to do it for a living.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
No, I'm all right.
Then?
From whom?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
What about?
Your name. And --
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
An hour?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Scottie, what are you doing?
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Mmmm.
That's what I had in mind.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
No, Ernie's is fine.
We're going awfully far.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
Scottie, please...!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
I made it.
Do you remember where you were?
Why?
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
What?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Why?
Do you hear anything?
And no birds sing.
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
What?!
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
No, don't go away!
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Madeleine --
Oh, yes!
How do you know? Personal experience?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I had to quit, Midge.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
I've never run across one like that.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Do you know him well?
Nothing to tell.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
But you said grey, sir.
Yes! That's it!
Can't do what?
First of all...
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Multiple reasons.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Why was the floor wet?
Don't point at me.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
So I didn't fucking do it!
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
What?
We can't do this.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Where is she?
So who's the lucky guy?
Call 911.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
What you just said. Say it again.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
What does that mean?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Hear what?
True.
You have a King fantasy.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
Ball park sausages.
Easy Micheal.
May we have the rings please?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
I think so.
The wedding cake check?
Yup.
You forgot the tent?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Right before the wedding?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Of course.
With all my heart.
Yeah. Nesting.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Do you love me?
What?
You fucked a prostitute?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
The wahoo moment?
I think so.
No...No.
The first day.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
No, the children sleep with me.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
You must think I am a monster.
Let me pass!
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
How in hell does it wind up?
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
What do you know about me?
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
Is she coming back?
How are you today?
Are your parents alive?
There's been an accident.
Very, very?
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Have I slept long?
From the terrace.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
I've seen worse.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
This better not be a wild goose chase.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
Should I have?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
What does that mean?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Relax. I know what you meant.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
Find out anything?
Where's John?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
You and me have nothing in common.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
What are you talking about?
For Schumann.
No, this is great.
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
...mmm?
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
When do we bring'em back?
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
Twenty thousand dollars.
The American "people"?
Why?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
...where is the Back End coming from?
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...can we see the Kitten...?
Why is this putz on the air...
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
No rain.
Get on this, right now...
...I just missed my plane.
Give'em another pill...
Oh, MiGod.
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
We're locked into Albania.
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Where is he?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
What's on your mind?
...why?
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
What do you want the kid to say?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Why Albania?
I never won an Oscar.
What do we have that they want?
President's speech.
What?
Where is he now?
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Uh huh...why?
I'm tired.
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
...as of today, 89% favorable.
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
With their berets...
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
What's going on?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Hey the door was open.
Sell?
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
You sure about this FAA announcement?
The FAA announcement.
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Oh no, no...
How do you know?
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
What about hard work?
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
...Gordon.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
What makes you think you can?
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Hello Bud.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
With Mark?
Thank you
Thank you
Can I give her a message?
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Oh that explains everything.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
It's only two hours away.
I'll come back all the time.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
What?
What does she look like?
She said, "You know."  That I know.
Who are you?
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
You're the flower lady.
What?  What are you afraid of?
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
I wanted to apologize.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
No, I don't.
We were suite mates.
You are?
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Yep.
Jody, no...
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
I was down in Adamant...
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Fine.
Tired?
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
In the house.  I was scared.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
Oh, no...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
What?  No.  No.
Sorry.  You understand.
Did you call about the Feurs?
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
You're not at the center.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Are you lonely?
Sweetheart--
I'm sorry...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Who?
Claire, please don't...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
Look for antiques...
I don't believe you.
There are two.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Stop it!
Lasher - bring us through!
Made it...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
I'm glad you're around to say it.
HARDER!
And whose houses do you design...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Seems more like a year than a month.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
You can't just -
Wow...
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
This must be one of the old keys -
Sugar?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
What did you do with her?
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
What's wrong?
What?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Yes...?
Sugar?
You and your pep talks.
What is it now?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
We reinvented ourselves.
You go first.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Well?
You have changed since second grade.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Dad, please.
The lesson being?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I guess.
Yeah.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
Some of them have to be automatics.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
If you could just sign right there.
I miss them, too.
Great.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Where are we going?
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
I never figured you for a pimp.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
In a hurry, are we?
Bad news.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
How you doing, Artie?
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
You okay?
I understand.
Try, Kelly.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
You could say that.
If you want company...
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He did say something.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
I say something funny?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Hi, Mon.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
That's not your line.
But check this...
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
That's cop bullshit.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Yeah, right.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Jim West.
Starting with a screw?
That's a lot of butler.
All what?
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
Uh... how long ago was this?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
This is good.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Really?
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Good work.  Really.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
That would be... the Mexican War?
The first.
Dr. Pemberton?
Are you all right?
I beg your pardon?
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
You hear trouble.
Because she's sick.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
She's a bird, Willow.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Dada, what's a daikini?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
What's the magician's weapon?
Tir Asleen.
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Your hole is healed, then?
Nail it!
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Amish.
Yeah.
So one of them got to him.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
What was that?
We do not go into your courts.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Anything against zippers?
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
We had some lemonade and he left.
I know.
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
That is idle talk.
What about Carter?
He'll live.
Is this where we're going?
Momma... are they angry with us.
They are English. They don't understand.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Yes.
To see?
Oh --
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Toto's my dog.
Are you ready now?
Oh --
Uh-huh.
...bed.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
...yes.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Yes -- let's run!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
But why?  Why?
Oh, come on.
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
They're coming back!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Who at?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
It's a whatzis.
You mean she bit you?
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh, did - did you see that?
It's a whozis.
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
How can I ever thank you enough?
But I still want one.
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
Zukovsky...
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
The inside man?
Who is it?
Consider me ungrateful.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
I’m sorry.
Does this look familiar to you?
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I don’t want to be safe!
Vodka martini.
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
Where’s M?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Now...where were we?
And the payoff on the tables?
No!  Get me out!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
You're the only human being I care for.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
What??
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
What are you up to?
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Yes you are.
I think he's going to the john.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
We should get back --  What?
No comment.
Adrian.
What is this place?
Why is that?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Not bad for a gimp.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Whatchu doing here?
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
I was invited. What's your story?
Go to hell!
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
What was that for?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
What's "Anarchy 99"?
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
I wish I could go.
What's wrong with him?
Are you all right?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Jean... can you?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
The point of what?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
To find Rogue.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
Is that what you're looking for?
I'll find him.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
You have the wrong house.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Yes, sir.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Surprised?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
It seems fine.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
There.
I thought you wanted to.
Could be worse!
That's not bad.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
But you did -- I just heard it.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
No, no!  That whole thing!
How's everything?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Inga!
And look at this, Doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
Do you think you can sing it?
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Good night, Doctor.
Why don't we talk inside?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
