There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a tee-shirt.
We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?
What?
Yes.
No, it's not crazy it's, uh, uh, it's a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn't make it worse.
So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
Hey, Leonard?
Okay, thanks for your time.
I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.
So?
Here we go.
Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.
Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.
Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
Yeah, those are men who just had sex.
Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.
What's he talking about?
Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?
What's going on?
One package, Phillips head screws.
Leonard look out!
No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and…
It's a bio-feedback technique, it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.
I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.
It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless of… well, you know.
Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Mahalo's a nice touch.
Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
Oh, no, no, no. No, I've too much to do.
Like luminous fish.
He gets his temper from his daddy.
Dr Gablehouser.
Dr Cooper.
Hey, how did it go?
I got my job back.
Well, it's all good.
The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Yeah, sure, why not.
Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?
So, do you know who's in there?
There are no incorrect equations on my board.
Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
Woah, Leonard, please, you're smothering me.
Really, oh yay!
But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.
True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.
He's a Hobbit! I've got your back.
It might. Boy, you're really smart.
Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.
Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.
Oh, what, what, what?
Or we could just have a life.
Well, sleep tight.
More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!
Mmmm, there's my little engine that could.
Sheldon you just can't dictate…
Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.
Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honour this is.
So?
What's happening to us? We're falling apart.
The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle.
And this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
Such sweet young men, they just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby.
Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course.
Oh my.
Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.
Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.
Okay, thanks.
No.
It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.
Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?
Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.
There you go.
You're right, this side does look better.
I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm a little nervous.
It's a classic, right?
I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there's just no pleasing you.
That would be me. Hey, check it out, it's a featured video.
So?
You could have told her the truth.
I couldn't say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.
Well now you are.
I was analysing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.
He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.
Do you have a cousin Leopold.
Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.
We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.
No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man.
Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.
Who are you?
It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?
Friday, was that morning or afternoon?
You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
Then call your own mother.  It was Sheldon.
Sorry.
Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.
It means go straight.
Then why did I have to crawl?
Told you the sensor would work.
Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor.  Sheldon appears in his comforter.)
And he's only fifteen years old.
I sense a disturbance in the force.
A year and a half.
Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec centre, they've got nautilus equipment.
Do I look like I lift weights.
You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it?
Yes.
It would blow up.
Sheldon.
Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.
Could I have everyone's attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.
He's back.
Wow, I almost didn't recognise him.
Maybe so. But you can't incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.
Let's put it to a vote. All those in favour….
I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start.
Just ask another one.
Howard, sit down.
Yes.
Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.
Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist.  Ow!
Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it's rough.
Come on, guys, push.
Sheldon?
Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.
So, when it's your turn you can.
Oh, I'm scared.
Excuse me?
So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?
Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.
He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.
I didn't say you were, I just said she was cute.
Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect.
That's fascinating, but I…
Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they're hitting on your sister.
Why?
Don't start with me dude.
Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you'd show up.
Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles.
Well yeah.
I don't celebrate my birthday.
Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7
Well why not?
Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
Why?
Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me… wow, this is hard. They got me… a motorised dirt bike.
Fill this out, have a seat.
Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.
Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.
You know what, I'm going to go back and try talking to her again.
Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought…. never mind.
No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels.
I'm pretty sure I never said that.
Ach, why not? We're already through the looking glass anyway.
Well of course you don't get it, I haven't made it yet. You'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as psychic.
Just like Schrodinger's Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is.
I don't think I can go out with her tonight.
Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.
Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?
What?
Yeah, there kind of does.
It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.
Who is it?
Hey, there he is, there's my old buddy-bud-bud.
First I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn't drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.
A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here's playing hacky sack, and this girl's going to be a paralegal.
It wasn't your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.
I'll leave the details up to you, I think it's better if you assume the male role.
Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?
You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?
You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.
Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
Well, I think tonight was a very good start.
Sure.
Only nine more months to comic-con.
You're welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?
Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they're almost pure protein.
Oh, sonofabitch!
Oh my God, a treasure chest, I'm rich!
(Leonard turns on stereo with a remote. Rhythmic bass-heavy music plays. The liquid begins dancing on the speaker.)
Hey, check it out, it's just corn starch and water.
Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.
Excuse me. Gablehauser.  It's for you.
Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she's interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I'm sure she'd be interfering with that too.
Hey, what's with him?
No.
Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!
Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.
Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.
Apologise, for what?
I sense you're trying to tell me something.
I had not considered that.
A lackey?
Oh, Raj, look at you!
It's bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
Anythingforagreencard.com?
It's not a date, and that's racist.
Brown rice, not white?
Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.
That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.
What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
Look, Rajesh, I understand, you're in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don't want it for a steady diet.
What's wrong with him?
Yeah, we're going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night's sleep. I don't like the way Darth Vader stares at me.
Then you can drive. Let's go.
You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one's reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.
Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don't have a problem.
I haven't configured it yet. Let's see… Bradley tank… transport truck…  Batmobile…
Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.
Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!
Aw, the pet store?
Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it's amazingly detailed.
Really? Why?
Excuse me?
Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.
You know, like what's his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
He does on Wednesdays.
Why?
Don't come in here, don't come in here, don't come in here, don't  Aw! What's going on?
What are you talking about?
What a nice girl.
Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.
Yeah, I guess.
What are you doing?
Yes.
Extra breading?
Vociferously?
Why would you do that?
I don't know. I was hungry? What's the big deal?
Leonard, she's in my spot.
Party with the pretty girls, dude!
Oh, I didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I've done some stupid things, you've done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
All right, I really didn't want to do this, but… here.
So what exactly do you want us to do?
Oh, okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.
Got it. So, can I see you again?
I'm going out for a while.
Okay.
Time shift
Howard' Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.
Yeah, a couple.
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!
I'm striking up a casual conversation with you. S'u'up?
No.
And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.
No, I didn't try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner.
No, no, we have seats.
What?
Oh, hi Stephanie.
She stuck a needle into my hand!
Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
Then it must be a tumour.
He did very nicely.
Out of coffee. Need coffee.
Okay, bye-bye.
What's that? Really? Right now?
Your pants are ruined.
You had sex, didn't you?
Yes, you don't always have to go along with what the woman wants.
Some hiney would be nice, too.
Hiney?
Wait! You bought me a present?
No, it's too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.
Uh-huh.
Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.
Since when?
Really? Why would you say that?
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.
That'll do it.
Well, someone had to say it. (Raj whispers in Leonard's ear) What?
Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?
Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it's cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May…
I'm not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!
Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
Hey Hofstadter!
Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?
Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.
Rebecca.
Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.
Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.
Don't be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you're not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.
Hewo. How did I walk past you? I'm Bawy.
Hmmm.
There are too many variables. It would take forever.
We've got to be missing something. Let's start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.
No, really, how much?
She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can.
Actually, it kind of… let's keep looking. Whoa, what's eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?
Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.
Oh, no. Oh, you don't want to do that.
I remember him.
Can't we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.
Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn't Slugger anymore. Your mother's here!
Loose, not bagged?
Yes.
Yes.
I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
Swell. If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation.
I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
Neck, shot, lime.  Okay, shot, lime.
You see right through me, don't you?
That is the sickest thing I've ever heard.
Get out!
All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.
Are you done?
Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it's really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?
He's got company!
That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don't eat in my desk chair and I don't work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.
What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There's a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?
Oh, didn't you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn't make the cut.
About 12 seconds ago.
No. No, not at all. You're also arm candy. So? What do you think?
Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.
Of course I haven't.
I forgot my flash drive.
Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.
I'll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.
Okay, here's another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you'd be Summer Winter.
So?
What is it?
Fine, cheeseburger.
I don't know, like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.
There. Done.
We do?
Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.
Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?
You're right, that's a great idea.
That's nice.
Sheldon…
Oh, thank God you're home. I need help.
Oh, I'd watch that.
I've seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don't do the exact same thing?
Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.
Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.
No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.
Yes, he won't let go of my comic book.
It's my comic book!
Yes, that's you.
See you, Stuart.
Well, if I get lucky, I don't want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.
No, he may not.
Isn't it a little late for coffee?
You got it.
I say Vegas baby!
That is a lot of cologne.
You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.
What's your name?
How can one person be a whole movie?
What?
Cut the crap, you set this up, didn't you?
Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don't want to screw it up.
About Stuart? Love to.
No! There, it went to voice mail.
How teeny tiny?
Well, tonight's my date with Penny and since we haven't been able to connect by phone…
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.
Morning. What's up?
Sure, what's up?
Yes, sir, I understand classified. We'll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.
Why?
Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning.
Sheldon, it's two o'clock in the morning.
Just imagine. If he says yes, we'll have an entire summer without Sheldon.
To the North Pole?
Penny.
Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.
I think I swallowed some paint!
I don't think I can go to the North Pole.
Okay, Leonard, I know you're concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.
Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.
Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man's understanding of the universe.
It's going to take more than I'm sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you've done to me.
It's a snowflake. From the North Pole.
Oh, my God. That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me that I didn't understand.
Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
Sure.
That's because in your dreams you're a horse from the waist down.
No, look, Mumbai Palace.
Fine? You said it was fine?
Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh, good! Now I can eat.
I'm Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
Well, could you look at Toby?
Let me show you something. See that? That's a Crawley's dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that's a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can't. That tramp took me for everything!
A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
Excuse me.
Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
I can't be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he's improbable.”
Sheldon! it's an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?
Fine, whatever. Are you finished?
Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate
Really?
They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.
I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I'm just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.
So what do you gals do?
What are you going to get, Raj?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Unbelievable.
well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.
Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.
Whatever.
We say they're in a very intimate area.
Celebrating Columbus Day.
So, my visa's only good as long as I'm employed at the university, and when they find out I've got squat, they're going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.
Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
You want me to work with you?
All right, we're going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.
Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you're going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
What are you doing here?
I don't know. What do you want me to do?
That's the only logical inference.
Nevertheless, I didn't say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.
I'll take the job. See you Monday.
Why not?
Well, I sure as hell wasn't going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…
Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!
I know, I'm studying it.
No.
I'm torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn't want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.
I'd love some.
Nest of snakes.
I wouldn't be bored. Why would I be bored?
Like who?
Oh come on, you're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?
If you want to blend in with Penny's friends, I'd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
And where were you?
I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
What the hell are you talking about?
Pay attention, Leonard. That's why she can't play on Sunday.
Oh, now I'm a child? Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!
Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
No.
No, there's a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.
Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.
Hey, don't bring my mother into this!
This is a restaurant. It's lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you'd be familiar with the paradigm.
What?
What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.
I'm busy too, you answer it.
Yeah?
So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn't sleep on your couch?
We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.
Big deal. Every time I watch that show it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
Alright, let's see what's on the east coast feed.
Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.
(At Penny's bedroom door, knock, knock, knock) Penny.  Penny.  Penny..
Oh, for god's sakes, I'm in the bathroom!
They're holding umbrellas.
Better. Thanks.
You have your learner's permit, right?
Didn't work out well.
What?
Actually, I've never had three dates with the same woman.
Excuse me, I have a master's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.
Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
Don't Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.
Where'd you get them?
Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn't gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.
That's amazing.
Then speak.
Twenty six hundred years?
That's great, Ma!
Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance.
No trouble at all.
Yes, dear. Mommy's proud. I've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.
My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas, so I'm going to say no.
When did this happen?
That's a lousy conversation starter.
Hey, Bev, guess what?
And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.
What about me?
I'm sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s.
How's your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?
Come on, Penny.
He'll have a Shirley Temple.
Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.
What's going on?
Hey.
So are our laptops.
Don't worry, there's no one out here. (Sound of woman screaming. Sheldon nods, and turns off TV. Walks down to Leonard's room.)
There's a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
I'm sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn't all that good.
Not lima beans, carbon atoms.
Oh, poor baby.
Oh, you've been falling all night. You're used to it.
Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?
I could do that.
That seems acceptable.
Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don't like touching other people's coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.
Sheldon, wait, this isn't even what I do. I'm a waitress, not a busboy.
No cilantro?
Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I've been looking at it all wrong. I can't consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It's a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.
No.
Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that's a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.
That's what I'm saying.
The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever.
What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, I realize that…
Maybe we can make a deal.
You said we were invited.
Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
Seedy underbelly?
I found it. The ring is mine. I don't understand why in this group I never get my way.
This ring.
Then let go!
NEVER!
Well, good for him.
Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
I'm not going to punch you.
I'm sorry, I'll start again.
Damn right, I'm angry with my mother. For God's sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That's when the bed-wetting started again.
Oh, Lord, this couldn't be any more humiliating.
Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it's getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.
Hmm.
Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.
No.
Time lapse.
Um, Ach.
Again, I'm sorry.
Really?
Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.
Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry.
Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.
Hold on. Nope, no reason.
No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
Hey, Leonard?
No, I won't.
Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.
For an hour and a half?
Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny.
Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
Oh, um, I should probably get going.
So you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
Well, she doesn't care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don't open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one's wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?
She's here, she's here. How do I look? Do I look smart?
Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.
Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?
Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
More than pleasant.
What the frak?
Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!
Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.
Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
Run away, dude.
What?
I'm Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…
Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that's a point in my favour, right?
That's correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I'll show you the rest of the apartment.
I'm sure he'll go away.
I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.
According to the roommate agreement, I'm entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.
Hmm, I'm still not comfortable. Of course. There's too many people here.
Oh. Well, in that case, I don't need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I'm the guy from whom you're trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot.
I can hear it!
Oh, so the dialogue offends you?
We're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
It's a surprise party, doesn't matter when we get there.
Well, mission accomplished.
The moon.
You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.
Look, I said I'm sorry. Can't u please let it go?
Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.
Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?
Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.
Yeah.
Oh. I hadn't considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don't think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
Um, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells great.
I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.
I don't know. I was just trying something.
What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
14.
Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.
What's a dogapus?
Nothing.
Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?
Certainly. I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.
Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
Thank you.
What am I up to now?
Sheldon- Very well. I don't understand why you're not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we're like Knight Rider.
Except in Knight Rider, the car isn't a yammering sphincter.
Sheldon- Be a lamb and open it for me.
Sheldon- Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
Correct. My turn.
All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.
Well, if that's the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.
Wow, that is better.
John and Yoko.
Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
I gotta tell you guys, I'm a little worried about Sheldon.
It's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
Okay, I got it, I got it, she's not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…
What's George Takei doing here?
Correct.
Really? And that didn't make her feel better?
Brobdingnagian.
All right, if you're not going to remove it, I'll remove it for you.
Sorry, I had to clock out.
Thank you.
It's passion fruit, new on the menu.
Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
Really?
I'm making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
Leonard, you are my best friend. I've known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.
Dude, why don't you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?
I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being.
Did you know that, Leonard?
All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
Oh, hey. I hope you didn't hear that.
She'll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
Tell her I'm not here.
We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.
Uh…
Why would I touch her, she's covered with airplane germs.
Oh please. My sister's much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
Well then apparently, you hate fun.
Hmm, Priya's not back yet? Well, I guess that's not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?
Oh yes. It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip, imagination.
You've really got to get out more.
Leonard, I'm trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.
Making pretty good time, huh?
I know, that's why I shortened it.
What alibi?
Oh, I'm so sure I'm going to regret this, but, who was I with?
What were you doing with Priya?
That was all a lie? This year's gifts are already wrapped!
I can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?
And I may have hit on her a little bit.
I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?
Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?
You'll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…
All right. Sheldon, what's on your mind?
Captain Kirk won.
You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.
Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.
You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn't just have to be about our lady parts.
Okay. Well, I guess we're having a slumber party. Oh!
Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm.
Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it's only going to upset you.
This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don't.
What… what kind of a kiss?
You think?
Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?
I love you.
–
Oh, what's the point of everything?
Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.
Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.
Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don't care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.
Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.
All right. What were the symptoms?
Oh, come on. That's never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.
Don't. It's terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.
That's not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.
What are you suggesting?
Were we here earlier?
A dolphin might.
You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you.
I don't know, it still wasn't very nice.
You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?
Yippee.
No, wait! I have a speech.
Five, four, three…
Hey, I…
A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
That's enough, Sheldon.
Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.
Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn't want to impede your progress.
Something got you down, there, Sheldon?
Aw.
Why not?
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you guys, but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.
What's he doing in your apartment?
Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.
I think her weekend just opened up.
It's eleven fifteen. I'm requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
Still right behind you.
It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It's not technically Road Trip God, it's Travel Supervisor.
Bernadette?
Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?
We have time now. Think about it.
We are?
Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula's coffin.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.
So, when could we start?
Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?
Oh, no!
Yeah, I'm right here, buddy. How are you?
Leonard (out of Raj's daydream): Or it could be sy-fee.
My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
Ah. There's my band of brainiacs. Where's Dr. Cooper?
Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
On the bright side, I don't think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.
Good morning, Mrs. Latham. Well, yes, of course I remember you. A woman well past her prime seeking to augment her social status by doling out her late husband's ill-gotten gains. So, how much money are you going to give me? I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested. Well, if you're not going to give me money, then why are you calling? She wants to talk to you. Who's crazy now?
Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don't, I, I really don't know why. Tonight? Sure, that'd be great. Okay, I'll, I'll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?
Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he'd had money.
Your call.
Great.
No.
You heard the man, Leonard. And while you're at it, I'm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn't you seek refuge under his roof?
That's it? That's your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom's nose holds up, we get two nights together?
I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.
It's not weird. There's lots of kids there with their moms.
Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn't look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.
You're having people over?
Hi.
Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.
Hear, hear.
You should get one.
Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.
Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let's go find me a heinie to bite.
Morning.
Sleep okay?
Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.
Here, shuffle these.
How about that!
Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I'm so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.
Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
Oopsy.
I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.
Oh, hi.
What?
Yeah. The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
Is this your card?
Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.
Or as you probably call it back home, food.
That's pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don't let me see it.
Okay.
You can hear my toilet flush?
All right. (Raj looks over Sheldon's shoulder. Holds two fingers over his heart). Two of hearts.
Good luck, fellas.
We got him. We're almost done.
Me, too.
That's the nicest thing he does to your sister.
Totally.
I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?
Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that's good news.
Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
Well you should have kept your mouth shut.
Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it's not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
If you don't mind, I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.
I'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.
Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
Hey.
Howard, let me just stop you right here.
You're pregnant?
Whee-ee-ee!
I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us 'cause people love monkeys.
Oh, good, you're up. I've written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I'd like you to sign it.
Why would I want to do that?
The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine
I don't know. I'm not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
That, that's brilliant.
And…
Got it. Bye.
I think he's getting worse.
I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It's the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
No.
Calm down. Everything's going to be okay.  We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?
Bernie, you okay?
Let me help you.
When it's done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
That's actually my napkin.
Fire demon.
Ma, I'm home! Where are you?
Jibber-jabber? I don't jibber-jabber.
To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don't think so.
I'm sorry, did I miss something?
No, I do not. You are a mean little man.
You really are a mean little man.
Uh, I'll have the Shepherd's Pie. You want to split that with me?
What?
Come on, dude, I'm exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.
We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.
Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You're okay to stay for a while.
Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.
You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He's completely freaking out!
Sheldon informed me that you're experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I'm here to help.
It's all over her Facebook page.
Oh. All right.
Of course. I'm always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.
Okay, just the candle thing.
Yes, no and no.
You know, some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance. They'd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
Hey, honey.
Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.
What is wrong?
When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?
Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
Now take off your shorts.
Amy.  Amy.  Amy.
Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
Yeah, you got it, you got it.
No, it's completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
Leonard, please. I don't need the running commentary.
Movie theatre.
So, dinner went nice.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?
Okay.
The hokey pokey is a young man's game.
Sounds like you had a great night.
Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
Does he like the pancakes?!
Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?
Well, hello? She's married.
A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.
Here's some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.
She says, sure, what about him?
Oh, that's pretty steep.
Are you crazy? That helmet's signed by Robert Downey Jr.
Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
Yeah, of course.
‘Cause there wasn't last time.
Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.
Sorry I'm late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team's design for the deep field space telescope that's going on the International Space Station this spring.
Oh, I get it. You're worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there's a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.
Just stop talking, Howard.
Howard.
Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We're supposed to be partners. We're supposed to be a team.
I don't understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party?
Okay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?
Oh, wow. I haven't seen one of these in years.  Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?
Twelve.
So what kind of cruise is this you're going on?
Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can't force things. You need to figure out if you're in a relationship or if you're just calling it one. It's like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don't make 'em biscuits.
No.
Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It's a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you'll excuse my mother, she's about to make a pecan pie that'll be so good I'll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.
Oh, hello, darlin'.
Good, good.
All right, Mom. When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son, believe it, because it's true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard's hand)
Are you getting sick?
Hey, they have wine here, don't they?
I hope so, because if this is well, life isn't worth living.
And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.
And whose fault was that?
What are you wearing?
Okay, well, I'd offer you Halloween candy, but that's gone. So, what's up?
She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
What?
If you're worried, we can go over there and see if she's all right.
Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.
Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
Yes, absolutely fine.
Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.
Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?
What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There's the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we'll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we'll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette's naked body. So that's happening.
Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I'm at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I'd like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I'm sorry, this is Animal Control. I don't understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you're frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you're stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don't you think I tried making cat noises?
All the time.
This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
I'm going to get some fries. You want anything?
Uh, right.
You're going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren't on a date.
Come on, he's not that cute.
It's remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He's magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven't offered you a beverage.
Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We're going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.
I didn't have any.
Yeah.
All right, fine. Let's just play.
And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here.
Here's a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.
Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.
We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
So, have you figured out what you're going to say to him?
Scrotum.
Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.
Technically, Howard's the gear head. Leonard's just a dime store laser jockey.
I never doubted you.
What apology?
Geez, you're still harping on that? What a puss.
I might kill him right now.
You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.
Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.
Nuts to that. What else you got?
I don't know what to tell you. Buy her something.
But we want cake now.
I don't think there's anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
Trust me, we are not a couple.
Look, it's obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.
Why, you guys going somewhere?
How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
Okay, he is not dying.
Because she's great in everything.
Yeah?
Well, that was fun.
Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.
In your pyjamas?
Fine.
Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he's not gonna get it from you.
Howard.
Uh, have you thought this through?
All right, that's it. Who Con, you're out.
No, I can't. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we'd have more fun things to talk about if I read more.
Great.
Uh-huh.
All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.
Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
Howard doesn't make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
‘Sup?
Absolutely. If you admit that you're a 30-year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own.
Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.
This is a Bunsen burner. I'm a scientist, I know what I'm doing. Oh, drat. (His s'more is on fire. He dunks it in a glass of water.) Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.
And how would I do that?
Every time?
Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.
Stop! I'm going to wet myself!
Why wouldn't you?
Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.
A pre-nup? Wow.
Biologists are mean.
I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they'd offer to toast it for me, too.
Ah, seeing as I'm on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don't let me have too many of those.
You know, this isn't that pressing. Why don't I talk to him about it in May.
What's up, fewwas?
This is not your office. It hasn't been assigned yet.
What the fwig is that?
I'll let you in on a little secret.
Mm.
I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.
So, what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?
I can't help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.
Sure, why?
Mr. D'Onofrio? It's Sheldon. They didn't have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don't know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you'd be laughing. Anyway, there's new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.
We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.
Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
I'm here to help you get through this. You can't do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.
No, it was called for.
Well, she'd just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.
You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I've already told everybody I'll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.
No. Bernadette's going to be playing with us. So, that's pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.
Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long for it to be funny.  I was wrong, it's still funny.
Who's Armin the miniature horse breeder?
Sure, I get that. I mean, he's your first boyfriend and all.
All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I'd say give him the silent treatment.
Armin… damn it.
I'm gonna go, too.
You're welcome. Don't worry, I didn't forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.
Oh dear Lord. No!
C'mon can't we just open one up and take a…
Once you open the box it loses its value.
Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.
That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it's unisex.
You're the one who told me to play with it.
What do you mean, she's a lesbian?
Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn't marry this woman.
I showed him some card tricks.
Let me try gansta, hells no.
Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.
That's a lot of belt buckles.
It's not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
Sheldon! I need your help!
Now zip me up.
I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.
Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.
What do you mean wrong?
Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you're half swan.
Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.
Oh. I guess you're just friends with anybody.  Aagh!
Oh, that's cool.
No, you're not.
Yes, yes, I've been doing my push-ups. I'm still stuck at nine, but that's going all the way down with no one holding me.
You're kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I'm really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too.  Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I'm not gonna die in space! I'm gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.
Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.
Yeah, so?
Oh, great.
No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.
But what about all the plans and the guests?
Good one.
That wasn't going to be our processional music.
Will you shut up?
Problem?
I believe you two have prepared vows?
Hey, guys.
No, we don't! Come on in!
I'm not going near that fakakta thing. I'll catch a computer virus.
Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and…
You can't leave. I need you.
Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.
Yeah, you're my first customer today.
Good night, Rocket Man.
No. Maybe. I don't know.
It's better. I wake up every morning and I just can't believe I'm on this incredible adventure.
I can't tell you why I can't tell you. So I guess there's two things I can't tell you.
I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?
What?
Oh, it's okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.
Howard.
You can't just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
Just say it.
Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?
You really think there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?
I should probably get to work.
Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.
All I said was she seems nice.
You're going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
All right. Well, tell him Amy called.
All right, I will tell him you called.
Given her what?
So, what kind of research are you doing?
Oh! You're kidding.
Oh, is that it?
What do you got?
Oh. Well, you're lucky. He seems very talented. And I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him.
Well, a lot of people can't. Uh, hey.
Uh, I think they're here for me, Ringo.
Lot of big talk from a man who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.
Uh-uh.
Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.
Long division, long division. Go, go, go.
All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.
One, two, three, eat.
You want the cheesecake or not?
For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.
Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
Like my husband?
That's not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.
Two tea bags in one cup? You're not at a rave.
Oh, what a nice surprise. I don't think you've ever seen my lab before.
Yeah. You got a problem with that?
I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones' mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.
Clever.
Nothing.
You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won't talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.
I should've picked hickey.
Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.
One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.
Elves? Come on, Leonard. It's too early for Lord of the Rings.
Yeah, doing the prom queen's homework so she'll like us.
Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth. Let's try it again. Everybody's having fun. And action.
Keep going, buddy, you're doing great.
Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
Well, you should've thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.
Why are you here?
Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.
Hey, Sheldon, it's a pleasure to be here. Well, we've got some interesting flags for…
Oh, that's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
Can't you face the other way and listen?
Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
Are you sure?
He's always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
‘sup?
They are not.
All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.
Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
Nope.
Fine. I'm taking your diploma.
Hey, anybody want a drink?
You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It's a bad idea.
Are you okay?!
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my spot.
Stop that. You stop that.
Hey, got a minute?
Is that your son?
Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?
Thank you.
Sheldon, this isn't helping. Why don't you just let me get some rest.
Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.
You can do it.
I like using a big shell. You can't eat them afterwards, but it's fun watching them blow up.
Great couple of gals.
Do you hear yourself when you say these things?
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don't tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.
I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”
I'm sorry, Raj.
Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
Forget it. I don't expect you guys to understand.
The drawbridge is lowering.
No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I've never felt so alive.  Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night's recordings.
What's going on?
Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.
Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!
Oh, damn it, you are.
Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.
Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop.
Did it have six breasts?
Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.
Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
Hey, Stuart.
Now let's do some sexy glamour shots. I'll set the mood.  Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That's right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…
Let's read it again.
Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.
Thanks, but we've got it covered.
How could Red Hulk be worthy?
Don't waste my time.
You're still out, right?
How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
How do I know you're not going to do that with mine?
Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it's three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.
The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I'm supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it's hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You've been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?
I know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.
All right, we're down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?
Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I'm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.
Ah, you're kiwing me, Cooper!
Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette's company going to Vegas?
Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.
Oh, please. You're a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.
Um…
Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.
Oh, boy. Breakfast.
Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
No, I don't want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.
You were right. I can't get out of here.
Should we go back and rescue him?
Yeah, why would you?
Since when don't you want to live with me?
Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.
Stuart That actually sounds kind of nice.
Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine's Day since she's been such a pain in the ass.
From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?
Oh, wow.
No, I just thought it would be…
Literally anybody.
What, so I'm the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.
Love you, too.
Oh, Sheldon.
I'm not saying that.
Usually I spend Valentine's Day sad and alone. This year, I'm just sad.
Oh, you poor baby.
I don't know.
Okay. So, what do you need?
Okay. Do whatever you want.
I just wanted to say, I'm sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn't cool. So, uh, yeah. I'm sorry.
I lied. I love them. I only said that so you'd go out with me.
Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?
Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It's a joke. Based on real events.
Excuse me, I'm meeting a girl here. It's kind of our first date.
Did you go to the moon?
No, we wouldn't ask him. We'd just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.
Later.
Please, Leonard, he said it's okay.
Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…
Yep.
Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet. Doesn't that count for something?
Actually, all I did was invite you.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you've been gone a long time.
Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up once in a while.
Amy.
Hey, it's still early. Why don't we go back and have that party?
Raj, don't dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.
Money from family does come with strings attached.
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.
You have to move.
It's too late. Get ready to like me.
The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.
Asthma attack?
Ready to go to lunch?
I have to talk to her about this.
No, it's not. I've always thought that was unfair.
What do you want from me?
…tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let's say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?
What do you mean?
No kidding. You didn't make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.
So, are you okay?
Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
Yes.
He was the host of this great… Hey!
I'm getting worried.
Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we're friends.
Yes, sir.
That's too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
What, well what's wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
Uh-oh.
I'm sorry things turned out this way.
Hang on, you've had her for hours?
Well, I'm, I'm booked to do a children's party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don't feel up to it.
Not that it's up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you're about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.
Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you'll know why.
Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.
Okay, if I upset you, then why didn't you just say something?
Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
Oh.
Ooh!
I've never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
Oh, that sounds romantic.
Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.
Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
Oh, Lucy, you don't have to answer that. Don't put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.
It was you.
Oh, dear Lord, a police officer's glancing in our direction. We've been made.
No. It's my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.
Hello to you, too. I'm sorry, but this is important.
You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.
Okay.
Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.
Okay.
I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.
Another? Great.
Oh, I just cannot believe you're here.
That's nice.
Howie, the oestrogen's getting absorbed by your skin. That's why you've been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.
No, he doesn't.
Ooh, now we're talking.
Do you want my help or not?
Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.
Sheldon.
Aw.
Uh, elephant?
Fine. Leonard, there's no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.
I'd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
Driving Sheldon to work.
He's still mad at Leonard, huh?
Well, he's mad at you, too. He says you're the succubus who led his friend astray.
Me, too.
No, you weren't because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.
It's not funny.
Because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it? I'm sure she finds it charming.
Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.
Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?
Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.
Okay. Oh, it's a bowling alley.
Great, climb back up. Come on.
To the tar pits.
But wait. So does this one.
So what'd you think?
Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I've watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it's still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here's my jaw, drop it.
Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one's in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.
Whatcha doin'?
Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He's got too much pride, she's got too much prejudice, it just works.
No. Not everything is about my mom.
Really?
Oh, cool, it tells you when someone's reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that's not her weight.
Let's discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.
Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody's having date night.
For the love of God, why?
I don't know. Sounds kind of heavy.
But you didn't even hear the details.
No!
Well, I cannot give this stuff away.
Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.
Sex doesn't count.
Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?
Okay, just you wait and see. I'm gonna romance your freakin' ass off.
I don't know if I want to cook for him. He's kind of a picky eater. I mean, it's too salty, it's too dry, it's too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?
Look, I'm a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.
Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.
Sheldon, I've been thinking about it, and you're right. You don't deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you.
Damn it, everyone's better at this than me.
Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You're like uranium-235 and I'm uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn't have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.
Trust me, I, I remember.
That's even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
Doesn't matter.
Of course you woke me, it's seven thirty.
Mr. Nye, hello. I'm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.
No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.
Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring? That came right off my mom's back.
My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
Buddy, I was just joking around.
Mmm. Thank you.
You've had this dart board since I've known you, but I've never seen you play.
That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?
Well, I don't know how to do that.
Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.
I don't know why but I always pictured her as Indian.
Is the point that you're an idiot?
Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I'd just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn't use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.
There's a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.
Sheldon, that was diabolical.
I don't believe you, you're lying to me.
Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?
How the hell do you know that?
I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he's not looking.
Why won't you sign it?
Yeah, everything was delicious.
The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.
Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?
No.
Uh, we're trying to cheer him up, so…
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late. Did you already have dinner?
Will you tell him he's out of his mind.
Thanks.
As I was saying…
You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.
Oh, she's pregnant? That's great. You're gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.
No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.
Well, I never told you about my brother's kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family's genitals?
Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I'm in this room.
Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you're not too busy, um, uh, if, if you'd be interested in telling me where the restroom is?
But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.
Which couldn't have happened if you didn't live across the hall from her, which couldn't have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn't with Penny, she never would have set you up.
Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?
Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don't know what else to do.
Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies' man.
Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you're in the mix.
Oh, Madame Curie.
If you're so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.
Parsa doesn't have those kind of resources.
We haven't even gotten to my scene yet.
I'm trying to make peace.
Sure.
Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?
Hey.
Come on. It's okay.
That's a good question.
Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
Thank you.
Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
Bye.
Oh, Sheldon, stay.
Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?
You okay?
You know, why don't I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn't rip you off.
I don't know. She already thinks I don't support this, so if I call, it might look like I'm checking up on her.
Oh, how's it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?
And out.
Oh, I've heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.
I don't know. Maybe 'cause dark doesn't show the stains?
It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.
Name one.
Yeah. What about it?
A little.
I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.
Item 28, your pet name for me. Time's running out on this. You need to make a decision.
I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.
I'm sorry, I meant questions about the food.
No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That's really bad for dogs.
Uh, something like this. I don't know. It came free with a full tank of gas.
Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can't believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I'll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.
We're really sorry. It was an accident.
I love you, too.
Oh, give it a rest.
I get it.
Yeah, she's right. You're grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.
Hi. Sorry I'm late, I was at an audition.
Here, you can have your seat.
Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?
Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.
And I just want you to know, I'm happy to look in on Bernadette while you're gone.
Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there's nothing I can do about it.
Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.
Oh, I've already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.
It doesn't?
Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.
Oh, don't anthropomorphize him, he's got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.
Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
Oh, I'm sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
Oh, how'd it go at the mechanic?
At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
And I'm afraid she doesn't think you're right for her.
No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we're both hardcore into quilting.
Hello.
Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life.
You can't leave. You're a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
What do you think I was gonna do at home?
Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?
They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
Shelly, I'm so glad you're here.
Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.
That's ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
Go to your room.
Go to your room!
You'll get offered something soon.
Xbox.
What does your agent think?
So, are you gonna see her again?
Aren't you gonna ask me?
Any news on your co-worker who's in the hospital?
Why would you do that? You're a string theorist as well.
You mean your acting career?
No.
See? This is exactly the kind of thing I'm worried about you saying in front of her.
One of the people that lives in his head.
Oh, well, turns out I'd already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.
Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I'm you. Get it?
Huh, well, I think there's some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.
Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?
I haven't been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I'd probably go with dark matter because…
Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.
Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
Hello. I didn't expect you this evening.
I'm fine.
Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there's nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?
Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don't we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.
My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn't want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.
Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon.
She'll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.
That was awkward, right?
Life? What life? Look at me, I'm a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don't know.
Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?
Come on, be serious.
How's your mom holding up?
And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.
I'm your son. What about the fact that she's good enough for me?
Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.
Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear back from the insurance company.
Then what can I do?
I'm gonna miss you.
I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they're all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.
Yeah, kind of.
Now, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm kind of excited to see Sheldon.
Well, I didn't say I was your father.
Yes.
But if I'm a professor, then I'll have to teach a class.
Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won't stop bugging me.
And you love the sound of your own voice.
Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don't you? That's right, say my name.
I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?
What are you doing?
Making a straw.
Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?
You violated the sanctity of my mouth.
Why didn't girls like us in high school?
Hi. What's going on?
Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.
There's no way this is sixty feet.
It does?
Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She's so much cuter than you, I don't know how you ever got her.
Leonard.
Look at you, talking sports.
Since when do you read social science?
Emily, you know almost everybody here.
Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.
Yeah.
We'll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart's comic book store. Is that okay?
Well, hear me out.
Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I'm your bubala. You can't have more than one bubala.
Well, maybe we have lost our focus.
Did you see The Lake House?
You would go to a beach house?
Robot prostitute.
If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty's hover board, that would have universal application.
Oh. Okay.
No.
What?
Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.
If only we had one.
It was us the whole time.
We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I've got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he's taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.
Thank you. And now I owe you one.
Save you first; come back for Raj only if there's time.
Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.
Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.
Amy (on walkie-talkie): You guys doing okay down there?
Why are you being so bossy?
If you would just use the bucket, you'd be so much more comfortable.
My struggle is emotional.
It's dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I'm back at square one. And, frankly, it's frightening.
The space probe.
What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
I think it's awful.
Okay, um, look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.
I don't know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they're rethinking it.
He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.
I would love to see your collection.
Oh, come on. It's a replica.
Yup.
So, you think she'll be single soon?
What?
You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.
Leonard, are you okay?
How is this helpful?
Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?
Sheldon, you look so handsome.
Thank you.
‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.
Thank you for wearing your heels.
Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal. End of story.
I'm not allergic to latex.
You don't look okay.
Twenty eight.
Fifty six.
It was like a grapefruit.
We're just saying all the things we love about each other.
That's intense.
You do this, I delete your contact information.
Who is it?
Does it work?
You're kidding.
LeVar Burton?  LeVar Burton?  LeVar Burton?
You guys suck.
You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that's a lot of oxygen.
And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.
Okay, how do we catch it?
Yeah, I appreciate the ride.
Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard, I'll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?
No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.
There's an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
Oh, not just something, no. It's from the heart, it's holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.
What colour would you like to be?
Oh, no, we'll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.
Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?
Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.
Uh, I've got some bad news. There's no cell service in here.
Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.
Actually there's no proof of that.
Well, what if you did it gradually?
Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I've done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.
Now, you just get comfortable.
No, I don't want to go to sleep, you can't make me.
So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.
Is your tongue blue?
It would be humiliating.
Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.
You look like a talking cupcake.
Get out!
So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?
And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom's through all this. I couldn't have done it otherwise.
Howie.
What? She didn't give me any puzzles.
Oh, my, that's it. Get out.
That is a good point. But I didn't marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I'm being.
All right, fine. I'm him.
Wait, hang on. If you're really Nathan Fillion, what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?
Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.
How are you doing, Stuart?
No.
Forget it.
I think we're safe.
Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.
Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.
Um, it's kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There's one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.
There's no way you could've known. Be right back. Excuse me?
Of course you are, I'm warm and soothing. I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.
That's it. That wasn't so bad.
Thank you for walking me home.
It really has.
Dude, the whole front came off. Now she's gonna know I was snooping.
Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.
Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.
So you're saying you wouldn't leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
Well, I think you broke the dowels. You're not gonna have time to glue it back on, you'll have to nail it.
I don't get it. There's actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
She sounds really mad.
Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.
Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
Exactly.
Do you need any help in the kitchen?
Wait, who's Tor?
You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?
No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?
And girls.
What?
Don't listen to him, all she's got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.
You know, Amy, I, uh, can't help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.
That's amazing.
I guess this could count as an adventure.
This is exciting.
So, Josh, what do you do?
And that was Kevin Smith.
So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?
Well, Leonard, don't you want to see the inside of the fort?
Really?
We could be betas. They're second in charge.
Tonight works better for me.
Oh, don't be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.
Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.
Don't forget your wallet.
Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.
Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
Hi.
Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?
No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.
Members of the faculty, students, I'm excited to speak to you today. I can't help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I'd also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.
Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera's working. Oh, look, it's me.
Don't you want to know for sure?
He's right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.
Uh, I don't know. They're pretty different.
Of course not. I love you. I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.
So nice to meet you.
Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn't think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.
We're not in a rush. We'll set a date when the time is right.
When your mom gets back, I'm gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.
Looks good.
I'm so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.
Whenever you're ready.
Yes.
I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.
Yeah. I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of 'em.
Hello.
Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date?
I'm in. Let's do it.
You okay?
Okay.
Oh.
Why not?
Amy broke up with Sheldon.
Penny's on the phone with her.
Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don't care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don't be shocked when you find out that I don't care.
I'm not gonna be alone. I'll be with my friends.
Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn't I invited to this?
Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
What if they call our names?
Aw, that was beautiful.
She broke up with me.
I just hope I did the right thing.
Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.
You know, it's bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.
Some girl named Mandy.
Right? I can't believe Amy actually went through with it.
Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.
I mean, if Penny finds out I've known all this time and haven't told her, she's gonna think I'm a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.
You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn't anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren't above cheating because that's usually how we met.
Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
Uh-huh.
It's getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.
Right now.
It runs on syphilis?
So, are you gonna give us a clue where we're headed?
We can drive there.
Speaking of Sheldon, how's single life treating you?
Good for you.
Okay, well, you're a grown woman now.
It is extraordinary.
What was that?
When?
Thanks a lot, guys.
What did we do?
The breakfast meat family?
If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.
Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
Oh, we could play filk music.
So did I.
Well, it's not like I'm never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.
You're healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I've got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you're the frontrunner.
I can't believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.
You really should've gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.
Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?
I'm telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can't dance to it.
Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?
But mostly here.
What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
When can I stab one of my friends?
Okay. Don't be offended, but, what went wrong with you?
Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.
Barry Kripke just asked me out.
I'm doing all right. I tried fencing today.
He could've softened the blow.
It's like it was yesterday.
Uh, I'm Leonard. This is my friend…
My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don't feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?
Because it's new and weird and I'm just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you'd get way too excited about it.
So, are we allowed to ask how it's going?
What? I thought we were all… never mind.
Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.
Yeah, you probably had it coming.
Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.
No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?
Just like you.
I'm going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.
Okay, I'll think about it.
Aren't you worried you're making French toast on oatmeal day?
Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.
Yeah, it's your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.
No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.
Are you sure? I've heard that on those sites, often when you think you're corresponding with someone, it's actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.
Someone will show.
I've been telling women that for 20 years.
Maybe she's waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
Um, listen, you're a really nice guy, but I just, I don't think this is working out.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Baby.
I am.
And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.
You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.
Sure. What is it?
So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.
I know. It makes its own gravy, it'll slide right down.
Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.  Oh. It's my friend Amy. Hello.
Did you have a nice time?
Why can't I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.
I'll show you.  Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I'm going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn't listen. Oh, wait.  Everyody cut footloose. Nope.
I'll keep rockin'. You don't do that.
Well, I shouldn't be surprised. There's a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.
Amy?  Amy?  Amy?
Well, I'll let you get back to your date.
I know. It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
Hi, Sheldon.
So, what'd you have in mind for tonight?
Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It's bad. Somebody kill me.
Do you think Sheldon's actually gonna go through with it?
He's right.
Leonard, I, I'm scared again.
Okay, well, I should unpack.
At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.
That's the one to beat. Leonard?
Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.
A doctor? Well, I hope you're not contagious. I've got a weekend in the telescope room I've been excited about for almost three minutes.
Ah, it's my pleasure. I'm curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?
Ooh, perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation.
So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.
Well, what are you thinking of naming it?
That is a great idea.
Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.
I miss you.
Oh, I love me some Leo.
No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
You're gonna want to take these with food.
Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.
What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don't play this game very often, but you're doing it wrong.
You went to Emily's to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.
You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.
I told him this was a bad idea.
Oh, God.
Still doesn't explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
Meemaw. I'm so happy to see you.
Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.
Oh, Sheldon, thank you.
Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.
People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they're around.
Ew, really? Get it out.
Since we're live, you'll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.
He is. Should we name him?
It is Valentine's Day. How about Valentino?
It is freaking amazing.
But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn't you start dating someone right away?
Well, I, I wouldn't say right away.
I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…
…spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.
Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
Oh, that's all right. All I heard was skinny.
Where?
We can, but all right.
Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?
Doctor said I can't have sushi.
And whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…
I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.
Doing great.
There's another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.
Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?
But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?
Well, I'm, I'm sure they'll ask you to give a speech, and that's when you just tear 'em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.
Oh, I wouldn't call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.
Speech! Speech!
Leslie. I can't remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.
Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.
I've never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.
Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.
Yeah, we did our own search.
Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?
She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.
Sure, we could write something up.
Are you sure you don't want to stay here with us?
Okay, I'll stop.
fade
Oh, I've always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.
After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.
But why wouldn't…
I think we're good.
Right.
Who are you texting?
Raj. He really wants to see this movie.
Why?
No. You know what? Don't. Don't. Let's let them think they're getting away with it.
I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
You have sporting equipment?
I don't.
Hey.
So, these are for you, and if you're not too mad, we'd love to take you guys to dinner.
I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.
I don't understand.
So I drink.
Yeah.
I can't tell anymore.
Really? Why?
Oh, yes.
Well, you have to go. It's Penny's first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.
This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
I never said that.
Well, then you don't understand what's happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.
I love Lisa Simpson.
Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?
She does not.
From Amy.
Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
Mm-hmm.
And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.
Well, little lady, you've heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.
They know that we're not exclusive, and we just don't ask too many questions.
Hello.
Okay, have fun.
Oh, I do. It was three years ago.
So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.
So what do you want to do tonight?
Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.
That's lovely, Sheldon.
I think you're gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.
I see what you're saying. She's not so great.
Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.
Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.
Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?
Hey.
How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
Hey, how'd it go?
You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.
Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.
Hey, guys.
He's just joining his friends; it's fine.
Excuse me.
Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I've been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I'm getting nowhere.
To be honest, I'm surprised you cared about the wedding at all.
I know how you feel. She didn't invite any of us.
Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honour?
Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I'm no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.
I'm being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.
Ah. And what do you do?
So, what did we miss?
Sure, Dad.
I'm at the Westin.
I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.
Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
Because you were driving like a lunatic.
I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.
Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother's house.
Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
Hello.
How is everyone today?
They're practicing for what's coming later.
Thank you for my new teeth.
Not just Leonard and Penny's love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn't think so.
Oh.
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am.
Oh, what did he say?
Are you crazy? You can't put that on Snapchat.
Hi.
Gentlemen, I'm Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.
Well, thanks, but you should know we're a little concerned about this being used in weapons.
It knows.
Oh, I'll go. I like a party.
Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you're here.
Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.
Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?
Are you just gonna name all the colours?
Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.
You don't.
Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
I think we're good.
Something's wrong. I don't care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.
Right. Sorry, sir.
We've hit a bit of a snag. We're already behind schedule.
I don't know. What if living together kills the romance?
Hello?
Eh.
Whoa, whoa! Now you're making fun of my bona fides?
Oh, you should go. It's terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.
Just as challenging?
Just as challenging as you?
That feels great.
Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?
Let me know when you start, because that wasn't funny.
Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.
Maybe. How 'bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?
They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon.
Have you noticed it's always an A-flat?
But you did.
You are truly wise.
I don't know. Bernadette's baby doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.
I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.
Though if you did, it's more zeroes than you're expecting.
Sure.
Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee's.
You have to admit, it's a pretty smooth ride.
I'm in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one.
As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.
Aw, you think you have an audience, that's funny.
I'll take that as a yes. She's secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven't noticed.
Great, and just so you know, I'm not getting rid of all your stuff.
Oh, hey, Sheldon.
Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.
Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.
What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let's
You're dating somebody, who is it?
What? What are you talking about?
There's nothing to tell.
Yes, in the telescope room.
Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.
Would you care for a brandy?
So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?
Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?
I can keep this, right?
Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain.
Your choice. It can be Pakistani food if you like.
Do you?
Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn't believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.
I've gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.
Remote- Hey good lookin', want to go for a spin?
I have no problem calling him.
Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.
Really?
Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone's jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I'll be out of things to wish for.
So do you.
I seem to be losing.
I'm sorry, you mumbled something?
My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.
Sheldon, get out here.
I think he might be right. Also, who is that?
So, no one's gonna tell me? Okay.
Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.
I'll pull the van up.
Team Baby, go.
Okay, well, we'll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It's gonna be a while.
Wowza.
I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
Do you want me to get the nurse?
Anyone else want to try?
Here.
Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.
That's too loud.
Yeah. Here. I'll catch you up.
What happened
Flashback.
Everyone's a better mom than me.
Well, I'd say that's thinking outside the box, but, come on.
Don't make me laugh.
Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don't think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.
All right, got Halley to sleep.
I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?
That sounds expensive.
Well, if x equals the amount that you'll miss me, then I'll miss you x plus one.
Thanks.
It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.
Okay, space A3, here we go. It's squeaking. Mark it.
Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.
I get to write a contract? I say, let's get this party of the first part started.
