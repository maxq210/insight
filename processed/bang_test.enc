Bye-bye
Bye.
Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.
Fine.
I'm sorry?
Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
Am I interrupting.
Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.
Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.
This is not anyone's home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.
I helped run some cable for a webcam.
O-o-o-oh!
Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.
It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.
Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.
What?
These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
Stay frosty, there's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.
Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.
So?
So, how did it go with Lesley?
Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?
Give me the phone.
You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common.
Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?
Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.
Nothing.
No, no, I meant…
We're fine.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?
Isn't it?
Honey, why did you get a loom?
That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?
It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
No.
Sheldon, he's just doodling, get in here.
Mmm-hmm?
I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.
I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.
If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.
Really?
Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.
Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.
She got lucky.
You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.
Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?
Sure.
You went with Thor?
I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
Okay.
I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we're in sync, we belong together.
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.
Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
I'm fine.
Yeah.
I should probably go.
Why?
Good night.
She's gone, Sheldon.
So?
Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
And divide it how, I'm telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
What's happening to us? We're falling apart.
God, it's just a question, he's so sensitive.
But Papa, I'm not supposed…
How can I call her, you know I can't talk to women.
There's a can in the fridge.
Okay.
Sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry?
Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.
Now listen to me….
Okay, thanks.
Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.
I don't know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary.
So, how's it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.
Ah. Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible. So it works as two.
Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.
I don't understand the question.
Then why did you say it.
Let's go.
So you admit that you're an egotist?
Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
Skynet is kinky? I don't know.
And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.
Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard…
I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.
Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.
I don't know what to say.
No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.
Thanks Penny.
Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.
Morning.
Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.
No problem. Welcome home.
Leonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.
What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
Dear Lord, not Milky Green!
You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.
No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.
What does that mean?
Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.
Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.
Lay it on me.
Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.
So, you see it too.
You can count on us, we're on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.
Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.
Great.
Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.
Why are all these young women here?
Hey, look at that.  It's Dennis Kim.
Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.
This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.
Good afternoon, and welcome to today's physics bowl practice round. I'm Penny, and I'll be your host, because apparently I didn't have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?
I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start.
He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.
Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
Hi guys.
Sheldon.
PMS? It's a couple of days early, but…
The Eta Meson.
You're never going to let that go, are you?
You didn't answer question.
Ten, nine, eight…
Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.
Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!
Sheldon, you can't be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. (Sits and turns it on. The three lights on the front illuminate. All let out an “oh”.) Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876.
Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.
No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it.
More importantly, you've a Darth Vader voice changer?
What's the exchange rate.
Okay man, be cool, we're all friends here.
No, I needed to hear it.
We have to get rid of the time machine.
How can you be late, I wasn't expecting you at all.
Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?
You too, swell, also.
My friend's getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.
No we don't.
Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there's a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.
Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.
I have an alternate proposal.
Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.
Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.
You can't do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it's no longer mint.
So, what did you get the birthday boy?
Told you not to ask.
Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh….  The laundry is out of the hamper.  Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it's out of the washer. I'll call you when it's in the dryer.
Penny! If I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.
Really?
Huh?
Yes.
Penny, look, I've got a problem.
Mai du lui tsa.
Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod!
Okay, where were we?
You know what, I'm going to go back and try talking to her again.
Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they're warm.
I'm sorry, what were the choices again?
No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own.
Can we please change the subject.
A second what? Pair of underwear?
There are a number of options and, I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.
Not the first one I've made today.
Okay. I think this will be my seat.
Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.
He's coming. Screen saver.
Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.
Well I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity? Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn't want him to think I was some stupid loser.
Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.
I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.
Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
Did you make fun of trains?
Who is it?
That I wouldn't tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her, that's ridiculous.
First I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn't drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.
Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?
Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.
Yes.
Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don't you just go to a movie or something?
Come on, Sheldon, there's so few places I can wear my jester costume.
Oh now you're just making stuff up.
Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.
Well that's not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.
No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly.
What's AFK?
Sheldon, wake up.
Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.
Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I'm going in.
Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!
Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
The people from People.
It's fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They're going to digitally add a supernova, they say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
Almost.
I can make it, but I won't.
You look very nice.
Then there's no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.
While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.
Goodnight, Sheldon.
How about we just have a little quiet time now?
Howard, help me out here.
Okay.
I'm actually more of a theorist.
Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.
Does it say I give a damn?
Okay, that's it, let's boot it up.
Hmmmm?
I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.
Yes, you are, you're meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
No, he lives here now.
But you finished your experiment a week ago.
Oh, now I'm gonna throw up.
The fact is I'm quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
So, how'd it go with Ramona last night?
Sisters?
You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.
Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that's a proper noun.
Is qochbe' spelled with a  or a ?
Oh. That's Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.
No.
Why would you do that?
Congratulations. You're officially one of us.
Oh, I didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
I don't care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.
Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.
Time to do your laundry, huh?
I am meeting you halfway, I'm willing to concede that you've done some stupid things.
Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.
I'll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
What are negs?
Howard, your scooter's blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?
On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
Snap what?
Okay, where is he going?
Time shift
Yeah.
Lisa?
Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
So, we're all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity, one of my earrings.
It's just her facebook page and we've only been going out a couple of weeks.
Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.
Yes.
Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
Oh, for god's sakes.
No, no, no, I got it.
Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.
I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.
What? no. no, that's not right.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're welcome, Leonard.
Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
Oh hey.
And then the, the subject got changed somehow.
What?
Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth's yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.
Raj, please, let's stay serious here. Superman's body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.
It's David Underhill. So what?
Ooh, “Dave.” Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.
He's funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That's not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I'm gonna go practice my situps.
Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn't moving.
Okay. Let's go.
Nice save, genius. Eggnog?
Smooth.
Okay, here.
Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
Good. Your mom seems nice.
Look, I'm telling you, I've known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I'm talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he's a nice guy.
But, Sheldon, we don't have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.
I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.
That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?
Go, Monte! Go Monte!
He slipped and fell.
You're driving me to the mall. I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
Family.
See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.
Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you're saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you're out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?
I'm confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
No, I can't.
This is money I'm not using.
Weird.
What are you saying? That I'm using my body to get dinner? That I'm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
Well, what was the plan?
TV star.
– Come on. It'll be fun.
Oh, cool, I got a sword.
And she sent you to get it from me?
Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?
Why?
Oh, I don't know where he would've gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.
Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
All right. Uh, what's new with you?
Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.
So, where were we?
Leonard, it's one o'clock, weren't you going to show me your laboratory at one o'clock?
So, no original research?
You always say that, but we never do.
Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?
Hello, Penny.
I'm not unhappy.
Yes!
No, it's Leslie Winkle. It's a long story.
How so?
I'm afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
Yeah, buddy?
Where are you going?
Yeah, I wish.
Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we're taking the train.
Thank you.
Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you've got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
That's it.
Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.
What's going on?
I'll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.
Terminator broke my phone.
This package came while you were at work.
It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I'm doing.
Fine, cheeseburger.
And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
Wait, wait, what am I going to do?
Uh, hey, it's your business. Do whatever you want.
Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
So, there is a number.
I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?
Freakishly feline?
You're welcome, Penny.
Sounds like a sweet deal.
Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.
Yeah.
So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?
Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.
You're joking.
Oh, absolutely.
What's a multiverse?
Yes.
Um, you know, it's kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?
Oh, gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?
More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
Wow, you're just going to make me come out and say it, aren't you?
Do you know, I'm such a good mood, I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.
Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren't home, and I forgot it there.
Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.
Don't worry, I can take good care of your friend.
Cut the crap, you set this up, didn't you?
Why the hell not?
Answer the phone, Leonard.
Well, tonight's my date with Penny and since we haven't been able to connect by phone…
Or e-mail.
Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.
That what that's for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
Damn right it's heavy, it's my mother's meat loaf, it's been testing toilets for generations.
No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
Excuse me.
Oh, hey, no, you don't have to apologize. There's no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.
Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.
I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.
Okay, can someone please tell me what's going on here?
It was the only way to make him happy.
No, you're right, you shouldn't talk to him. I will.
Look, Sheldon, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it's like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true, like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?
Can I… Can I get you something to drink?
If y'all don't mind, I got a hankerin' for a Lone Star beer.
You'll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn't it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who's an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she'd be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.
It's not a matter of opportunity. We're getting to know each other. There's a learning curve.
Okay, when you say “it wasn't great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?
Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
Help me open it.
Are you crazy? We can't go down an empty elevator shaft.
Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
Stairwell.
No, no. We're here, let's settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?
Well, I wish I could.
Hey. What's going on?
You know what, I give up. He's impossible.
Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband's name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband's name is Kim.
Um, yeah, sure, thanks.
Good for you.
Dark and fun.
Mmm, these are so good
Wow. What a great night.
Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
You guess? You don't seem to have much of a handle on this.
That's happy, right?
Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
You know, whatever.
I need an aspirin.
Uh, please understand that it's not that we don't want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.
I'm the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
Ba-eye.
Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you're playing in the tournament. Sign here.
She's adorable, Howard. I think you'll like her.
What?
You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It's a totally different set of characters.
Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
Oh, yes.
Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I'll go under and cut his line.
Sorry.
Oh, they think we're flanking, they're playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…
It was pretty good. We won.
Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.
Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?
What the hell are you talking about?
I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
Bye.
Who is this Justin?
I told you about him.
Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!
Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should've backed off.
Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.
I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
What?
Howard' Howard, answer the door! I'm busy!
Yeah?
I'm not leaving until you talk to me.
Ooh, Real Sex.
Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?
Yeah, me, too.
Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!
So, when do the meteors get here?
Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast. What's that?
I know they're poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.
Quick, get forks.
Maybe you need to think about it a little.
Howard' Howard! What are you doing in there?
Good.
The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.
No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
Ooh, I love your shoes.
Shoes for Less.
Um, actually, can we do it in private?
Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?
Excuse me?
Howard' Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.
Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let's plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?
It's not. That's why Leonard does it.
We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.
You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?
Fine, Mom. How are you?
My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
Oh, glad you're here, uh, sit down, I'll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.
If it helps, we're all good with your breasts.
Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who's getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?
It's a conversation starter.
What do you want, Sheldon?
Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.
Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?
How is everything tonight?
What was that?
Great.
Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?
In anticipation of their arrival, I've bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.
I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.
Good night. That was weird, even for him.
May I come in?
Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don't think the two of you'd be comfortable on the couch.
But you don't like other people.
Listen to her, Jim.
There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
I'll send them a basket of muffins.
Where did you get all this stuff?
And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?
Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
Sorry. I'm moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
Oh, poor baby.
Your cell phone was off.
You're welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you're on your back.
No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
He never went back to the university?
Sheesh.
Thank you.
Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There's a $39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.
I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.
Hello.
Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.
Cholermus. It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
Yes, that good news.
Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she's not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you're still interested, you're welcome to come.
Yes.
Not my problem. I just don't understand how this happened to me. I'm scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.
No, it isn't.
I am not guilty. I only have a learner's permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.
That's what I'm saying.
What is this?
And who performed that heroic act?
I need to use the restroom.
Deal.
Hi. I'm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.
Okay, bye.
No, but it's close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.
I found it. The ring is mine. I don't understand why in this group I never get my way.
Yeah, it's delicious, the sarcasm's a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.
Looking for something?
Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
It's a prop from a movie, and we're kind of fighting over it.
Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don't even get to keep it?
Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj's attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.
All right. I'll bet your Meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
Oh-ho-ho, it's working all right. I have to pee.
Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand. It wasn't ours.
What's your point?
Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call  three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don't want to forfeit the award? Well, you've got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you.  Problem.
What, to you, is a large crowd?
No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.
Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.
This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six.  Okay, I think we have a winner.
Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
And how did that make you feel?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year's Chancellor's award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I'd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon's mother, who couldn't be here tonight. Isn't that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She's proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That's what she calls him. Shelly, it's a pet name. You know what my mother's pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of…
What's the matter?
First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn't hear me. If you'd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I'd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.
Do you really want to get into this right now?
Yeah, I do.
Time lapse.
Well, if he does, don't believe it. He's not above playing the dead meemaw card.
Everyone.
I was talking with Penny.
Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
What?
Maybe this isn't a good time.
Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
What do you want?
I was going to see that with him.
Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
I can't believe they let him into Canada.
Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.
Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see  a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble's constant.
Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
Well, now…
Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?
And of course, you've already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
Who's that
I bought a parrot.
Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
Oh, uh, well, that's tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.
And you have a vehicle?
Well, can't you drive?
Why don't you let me do this.
Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
So, I get the draft?
What'd you do that for? I had plenty of time.
Okay, I'm sorry.
She dumped you?
Now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.
You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!
She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.
As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.
Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.
Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What's that?
Ask me to pass the soy sauce.
I'm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.
Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.
You're welcome.
Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.
Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?
No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it's gonna start twisting.
Once a year. It's a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?
I'll be happy to check the math, but numbers don't lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.
If I'd thought of that in the first place, I could've saved myself this whole night.
My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.
It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there's a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.
So, you're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
A hybrid dog and octopus. Man's underwater best friend.
It's a small price to pay.
Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?
Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?
Well, if it's not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst!  On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.
Thank you. They're my mother's.
I think so.
He's just expressing his admiration that you don't even have to put out to get free stuff.
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
Fine, but don't expect my help.
Sheldon- I have an override switch.
Sheldon- Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.
In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?
Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It's pretty interesting. This guy's working from a hypothesis where…
A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy.
Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
It's how they lure you in. I believe it's called bait and switch.
I'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.
Get one yourself.
That's very offensive.
Oh, no.
Hey, Sheldon.
Amy.
About what?
Okay, I got it, I got it, she's not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
Oh, Penny? Penny?
No, I can't eat melon.
I think it shrunk! I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!
But I can't have one.
You're two for two.
All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.
Really? And that didn't make her feel better?
Why on earth are you telling me all this?
Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I'd say it's spot-on.
Oh. I'm sorry.
What about you, have you been seeing anybody?
Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…
I'll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
That's it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
What are you doing in there?
All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.
Hey, guys.
When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.
You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can't even speak to women.
…who's a friend.
Not really. She's horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?
May I offer an observation?
Good night.  Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
Well, you know how you're always saying that Amy is a girl who's your friend, and not your girlfriend?
Thank you. I've also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.
Number 42!
Yep, it is.
Amy Farrah Fowler, that's the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.
Oh, yes, it's time for me to make love to your daughter's vagina.
And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
Thanks.
Hey, good for you.
You've really got to get out more.
Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.
Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
Use your best judgement.
Sounds great.
Making pretty good time, huh?
Priya and I are both adults. We didn't betray Raj.
Yeah.
What does that have to do with me and women?
Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.
Seven years.
No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.
Yes. Of course, we're in different departments. He's an engineer and I'm an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.
Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?
Not particularly.
Could you get that?
For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?
That's really not the sort of thing we're interested in.
To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it'd be Sheldon.
Who knows? I haven't watched any scary movies recently. I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
Your apology is not accepted.
Sheldon?
What?
Relax, it's five o'clock. The movie doesn't start till midnight.
Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it's already five o'clock. Let's go.
Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.
Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.
This is where we could have been if we hadn't stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.
All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.
Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.
Calm down, Sheldon.
No!
Where did he go?  We're looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.
Ooh, like what?
Actually, Indian Monopoly's just like regular, except the money's in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.
Miss.
–
You just have to look.
I'm sorry, daddy…
Let me finish.
Excuse me?
That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
Hey.
Couldn't you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who's the obvious sidekick?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.
Oh, hey.
The Motion Picture?
That's thinking ahead.
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Please don't drag this out. This is never going to come off.
Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.
Hey.
A dolphin might.
Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I'm stupid.
That happened to you?
A Milk Dud?
I got a better idea. We're all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who's with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?
Go away, Sheldon.
I'm not going to that party, Leonard.
Who, me?
Okay, stop, stop!
That is ridiculous.
Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.
Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You're clearly listed as founder.
Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you'll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.
Look, I'm still happy to drive you to work. Nothing's changed in that regard. We're still roommates, we're still friends.
Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.
Bored.
Please don't touch my breasts.
She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.
Oh, right, right, the blog.
So, how do you wanna do this?
We're just gonna have to make the best of this.
Okay, when you say make the best of it.
Thank you.
Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It's not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.
How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
Oh. How'd he do?
Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That's rather unfair. That's downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I'm not familiar with the acronym KMN.
It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.
I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.
Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.
Hoo!
Okay, Raj, I know you've been avoiding me and Howard, and I'm not leaving until you tell me what's going on inside that little head of yours.
My universe!
Or maybe he heard it's Tator Tot Tuesday. That's why I'm here.
Hey, there's my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?
Yeah. So, listen, fellas, who's up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.
More than we can use. You see, in India, we don't make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.
Right. Fascinate me.
Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I'm not above minimizing your window.
That's it. Prepare to be minimized.
Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.
Yes!
Penny, you're an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.
I took a shot, sue me.
Thank you.
No, it's true.
Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
Sure.
There it is, Priya. We're Indian. We believe this stuff.
I'm listening.
She says it the same way I do. I'd love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It's not a big deal.
Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.
How come it's not a party when we do it here?
The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?
Just sit here.
Penny, I'm sorry you got dragged into this. I know you're devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.
Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you'd be called Leonard and the Leonards.
Good-bye, Sheldon.
Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.
Does yours have wet bweasts in it?
Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
Okay, let's go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.
Yeah, well, it's not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I'm totally okay with it.
It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let's go find me a heinie to bite.
No.
Then it's not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you're from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.
Cheers.
I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.
Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?
Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.
All right. (Raj looks over Sheldon's shoulder. Holds two fingers over his heart). Two of hearts.
Fine. Dr. Cooper. I'm sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.
This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.
Oh! Hello.
Seriously?
Hello.
Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.
Oh, geez, I don't know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.
Aw, screw it. I'm in.
Howard' Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!
She's curvy and she owns it. I like that.
No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart than a Klingon bat'leth.
Are you Todd Zarnecki?
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Marry you?
Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
Oh, God. What's happening?
What kind of emergency?
Penny?  Penny?  Penny?
Ooh, the Priya bashing's starting early. Yay! Okay, what's up with those pantsuits?
It's hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
It's a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?
Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?
Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.
You okay?
Hey. Seriously? Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
What?
Most of those guys live in Texas.
You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never grilled you about that. I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
Yeah, it's hysterical.
I'm glad you think so. That's what I strive to emulate.
Okay, let's see if this drug works.
Uh, okay, sure. Why not?
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
five-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.
What?
Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other.
All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.
He hasn't told her yet. He's waiting for the right time.
Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.
It's not a big deal, Sheldon. It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister, I've had to keep my distance. I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.
So, how is she?
What?
No!
Don't worry, you'll be fine. Let's just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.
You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.
There was one time I put body glitter on.
Sea bass. I'll have the sea bass.
You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.
Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?
Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.
Monkeys.
Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren't friends, and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story, I'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.
No, you weren't listening. She said, it's not what it looks like.
Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.
I'm… I'm sorry. What does this have to do with me?
You know, I've done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.
Where are we going?
Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.
Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?
I did. It was beautiful.
Oh!
Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you're not doing this 'cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you're a single woman.
A hobby?
A good wife would go to the store.
Oh, all right, well, I'm glad you like it. I mean, I still can't get over the fact someone just threw it away.
I don't know about this, Howard.
Yeah, you got it, you got it.
Aren't you worried about it being unhygienic?
Check it out. Free chair.
Okay, I'm not driving him.
Why not? It's a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom's there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.
Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?
Really? For a wedding?
She can come in and brush her teeth! I'm not embarrassed!
The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let's face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.
Emily, this is our friend Raj.
Look, I don't know the sign for opalescent.
Yeah, but I'm a make out king.
Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.
What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could've dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn't have, because I'm not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.
How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
I don't have feelings.
Penny called us.
I know, I know.
Thanks for dinner, buddy.
Mm. Tough decision. There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
Well, it's a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.
Take it, take it.
Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.
I've been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?
Change your mind about sex? I'm still mad, but I'll do it.
What?
Oh, wow. I haven't seen one of these in years.  Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?
Ten.
It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?
Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?
Hey, they have wine here, don't they?
Sorry.
Want to see a comic I draw?
Cool. Oh, look. That's you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?
So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?
Okay, we used to go out, right?
What does your gut tell you?
On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?
Well, I, I'm gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don't you think it could have waited until then?
Uh, not so good. We have to talk.
A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.
Well, it's not a competition.
Well, if you don't mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.
You're leaving?
You do?
Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.
For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
What?
Moo-shu is Penny.
It's okay. I'm glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!
No, you don't.
Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude and that's what's important.
Uh, no, thanks.
The Movie.
Oh.
Oh, he's a sweetie.
Okay, I'm not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.
It's amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?
I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don't own Amy. Can't own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you're going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you'll have to know.
Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?
Incredibly so.
You're so full of it.
Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.
Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Stuart, please. You're being rude.
You're being impossible.
‘Cause when I wear it, it's a shirt. So, what's Howard doing tonight?
Worst part was, it was too big.
What about you?
Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
Yeah.
That's nice. Anyway, I've been dreaming of this day for a long time.
Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
Well, just smile and think about koalas.
Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
Has she tried on the vest yet?
I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She's short and stacked, like me!
No. I think I'll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
Right, when it's our kid that's ruined my body and kept me up all night and I've got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that'll be completely different.
Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.
What's your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
Okay, look, he bought you this.
I don't know, hunting?
I know, but we've finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?
Because she's great in everything.
I'm sorry, what did I say?
Okay, it's just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.
Why not?
Howard.
I'm just making a point.
Well…
You know what? I don't have to stand here and take this crap. (Goes to Penny's apartment.)
No, I mean just you and me.
Well, it's a little late for me to start saying no, isn't it?
Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I'm back.
My name is Siri.
You've taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
Hey. You ready to go?
Thank you.
I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
Ninth?
You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?
Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.
‘Sup?
Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s'more by myself. And then I'm gonna have s'more. By myself.
Of course you do. It's about you, like everything else.  Oh, thank goodness. I don't think I had it in me to make another glass of water.
No.
Can I control the thermostat?
Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a  Okay. No, no. I'll start over. Professor
I just don't know how I'm gonna break it to him.
I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn't leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.
I'm excited to work with my boyfriend. It's gonna be romantic.
Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.
366… 367…
You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they'd offer to toast it for me, too.
Okay.
Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.
That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.
Ew!
Time. Wan out of woom.
Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force.  I'm gonna need more force.
Bye.
Huh, I try.
Why is there a hole here?
How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I'll pick you up when you're done.
What are you talking about?
Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.
So, what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?
Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I'm going
Sure, why?
Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that's, that-that's what chess is all about.
You're right. I should embrace the chaos.
Surprise.
All right, honey, look, we've known each other for a long time now, right? I've taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you're sick, you've even saw me naked once.
What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
Woo-hoo!
Penny!  Penny!  Penny!
I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt's nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It's like a vacation for your teeth.
I don't think I want to play a game.
There's absolutely no difference.
I'm gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.
Oh.
What about the Science Center?
We married for love.
Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.
Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we're on the same page.
Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they'd blow us off, and then we'd tell each other they were probably gay. It's like that. Except this time it's true.
Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.
Not necessarily. I think we've found someone for you to cuddle with.
I showed him some card tricks.
You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw's forks never had that.
Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.
This is not my laundry.
Oh, I'm sorry, condescending means…
What's the matter?
Give me a compliment.
You're upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
No, uh, that, that's it. I don't know much about women. Raj, you got anything?
Oh, hi.
All right, well, could you at least give her a message?
You're kidding. Shouldn't the question be why aren't you?
You're a mean one Mr. Grinch.
You're kidding.
No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.
Oh, Howie, that's wonderful!
I assume we're talking about you now?
I'm sorry. May I be excused?
Uh-huh.
Check.
Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.
Seriously? You're going to wear that thing to City Hall?
It's the groom.
Don't be snippy. I'm just excited to talk to my baby.
Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
Thank you.
Who is it?
A woman who says she's your mother but sounds like your father.
Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.
Yeah, I-I'd like to, but I'm a little tight on funds.
Okay.
No. Maybe. I don't know.
Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?
I went to art school.
It's not fair. Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.
Penny said she's not sure she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.
String theory is complicated. That's just yucky. Don't get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let's say that's true. Why doesn't Penny just end the relationship?
I wish there were more.
Penny?
I got to get back to work. I love you.
Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It's from your mom.
That's a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.
I'm sorry. He's asked me to hold all calls unless you're Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.
Rainbow, not chocolate.
Stems removed?
I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
Nothing with quarks.
It's a chocolate chip cookie.
Later
It's just allergies.
I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome where they'd actually chop somebody's ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.
All right, let's keep it simple. How about darts?
Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain's on the door.
How could you not find him?
Oh, my God, you're back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.
So I, I, I'd be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?
Two tea bags in one cup? You're not at a rave.
Anybody home?
That is a pencil sharpener.
Yeah. You got a problem with that?
It's funny because bread sounds like dead.
Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
Do you have a preference?
No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he's not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.
Fine.
Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.
Sorry. Whatever. It's all good.
Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?
You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn't want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.
So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.
It's called Fun with Flags. They're not at half-mast, nobody died. Let's try and keep it upbeat.
And cut. You realize that I'm doing this for free, right?
I thought you had plans with Amy.
And you?
You'll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me. Tell him you're not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.
Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.
Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.
Okay, I'm sorry.
You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
Do you expect me to build this?
Who you talking to?
Don't be like that.
All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.
But next time, we'll be cat burglars.
Are we good?
Hi.
Nope.
I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.
Oh. You said I'm not using my space, so I'm using it.
Those aren't gonna help you, Sheldon,
I'd like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.
Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie's bad when my homegirl Sandy B can't save it.
102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It's like you're not even trying to get better.
Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.
Yes.
So you've just been lying to him?
Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.
Oh, man, the first monster I see, I'm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.
No, screw that noise, I'm going in. Hang on, Santa, I'm coming for you.
Not that I can think of.
Think harder.
Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.
What?
Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don't ever tell my mother I said that.
Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.
Well, if you want, you can come with me.
I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
Well, that's not acceptable. I mean, I'm her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.
Wait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?
I'm gonna kill her.
Now, there's no need to get defensive. I'm not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.
So I've been told. But I can't understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.
Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.
Well, y-you, I-I'm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle…
You do that?
Oh, would you stop worrying about that?
Well, then why are you going?
He's not exhausting at all.
I mean, it's such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.
Has it really only been ten miles?
What did you do?
I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
Counterpoint, no, it's not.
Makeup? Sure.
I don't know, sounds pretty cool.
Yeah?
A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?
Oh, man. Look at my nose.
See, I did all this great work, and now he's just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.
You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.
Nice twy. This is bwank paper.
Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.
Maybe you don't, I do. What's the deal?
It's a possibility.
Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
Leonard, wait.
Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
Dude, I'm a single man. Saturday night is my party night.
Great. Here I am!
Um…
Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.
Is that so?
Okay, I guess.
Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?
What did I do?
Hold on. If you don't want to live with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?
Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.
We're not home right now.
Everything okay?
Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?
She hid my Xbox like I'm a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.
Oh, yeah, think about it. We'd hang out, we'd read comic books, we'd see movies. It'd be like the best relationship ever.
It's like you said, you're my girlfriend.
You really think so?
What's wrong?
It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.
Hello. How's the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
Sorry. Can you just give him this?
Uh, would you like to come in?
Oh, I totally am. If it wasn't for this beer, I couldn't even talk to you right now. I'm a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.
Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you'll see.
…when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That's how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.
If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.
What exactly are you looking up?
How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
People say I'm a little awkward, too. May I join you?
No, but I did go to the International Space Station.
Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.
You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.
Oh, my God, it's beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
Well, it's just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
No.
I can't believe he set it on fire.
Hey, Sheldon.
Sure.
Yeah, try doing it in heels.
I know what was in your dad's letter.
What? Us? Who else knows?
You can't get fired even if you're bad at it?
Yep. I got to get a home gym.
Janine the Machine, wet's do this!
Let's go.
Mrs Davis?  Mrs Davis?  Mrs Davis?
Gentlemen.
Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I'm fine, though.
Fine. Bad.
Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
What are you going to do? Take people's drink orders and get them wrong?
Well, you'll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you'll make any more friends.
Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?
Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.
Well, that doesn't seem fair.
Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn't you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
Is something going on?
5 Don't stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.
Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
The third floor landing. The poor old guy's been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It's really you.
I am.
We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
No, she, she's the only reason I've, I've stayed this long.
Your vitals are stable, but let's take you in for some tests just to be safe.
Can't believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I'd be a terrible mom.
Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
Want me to sing it again?
Vegas, here we come.
The ladies are away, the boys will play.
We'll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali's bloody corpse, and says,  don't worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest.  Well, I'm just a tree, but if I were you, I'd listen to your ghost friend.
Kind of funky.
Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.
Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn't he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?
Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.
I don't like this.
And now?
Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't see that through.
Oh, that sounds romantic.
What do you think?
Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
Let's see. Six. That's pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.
That's the thing, you can't. I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.
Sure.
Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.
Actually, I was thinking Leonard.
Yeah.
I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.
Thank you.
Oh, no.
No. It's my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.
Look, Bernie's at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I'll go with you.
If I make this move, but I won't because we're having too much fun.
Okay, let's take a break.
Sure.
I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.
Leonard! Hi!
Well…
No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.
Come on, Raj, it's a yes or no question.
Hmm. Uh, let me see something.
I'd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.
Driving Sheldon to work.
You're right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
So now we're just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.
I've put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men's section.
Oh, very well. I'm no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!
Howie, the oestrogen's getting absorbed by your skin. That's why you've been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.
I don't think Penny would cheat on Leonard.
Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.
No, Sheldon, don't.
Do you want my help or not?
All right, I'll give you that one.
No, you weren't because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.
Aw.
I think it sounds fun.
Oh, see? Now he gets it.
Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
No, because I didn't want her on my team.
I love Neil Diamond.
Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
Can you reach the clue?
I'm not a child. I know the word ninny.
My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It's one of my all-time favourites.
Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I'd keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.
I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I'm being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?
I do have one oddly long testicle.
Sorry, buddy.
I'm sharing my pain.
Strike two.
I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work.
Why? So you can see the look on Amy's face when she hears my top-notch idea?
He's never gonna stop doing that, is he?
Last week, you told Leonard he couldn't wear his Wookie jacket out in public.
Well, then, you have my permission.
Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.
Hey.
That's 'cause you always fill up on chips.
Oh, please, I'm your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That's right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.
Ooh, shrimp was spicy.
Hi.
I'm not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.
Pull.
Sex doesn't count.
What's wrong?
What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I'm not a genius, I'm a fraud.
Oh, please?
Poor Bernadette.
Oh, Howie.
Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you'll see why.
No, it's not. I mean, what's thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here's the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here's the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.
I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.
Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?
Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess.
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Hey, guys, what do you think?
Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I'm getting a drink.
No, thanks.
Another photo from Sheldon?
Thank you. It would be an honour.
Mmm. Thank you.
Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.
So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.
Any chance I can get a different waitress?
I'd save that for the second date.
I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?
Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!
Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?
Wait, you went to a chapel?
But it didn't seem real.
Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard's proposed, he's gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that's just off the top of my head.
What's with you?
Why are you mad at me? You're the one that did the stupid thing. I'm just trying to fix it.
Yeah.
All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there's the clown that came out of her. I really didn't want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I've had in a long time.
I'm sorry, too.
Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.
Certainly. Although, right now, I'm having a rough time because there's three people in my room, and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.
You're gonna brush your teeth on my couch?
And the other half licking my face. That's why I'm brushing her teeth.
No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.
So no more interviews?
Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
Thew he is. It's my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.
You're not a lousy husband. You're a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.
You're telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…
Actually, I didn't invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.
Texas.
Yes. My sister's uterus came down with a baby.
No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn't available.
Yeah, if he's in the room when they're making the baby, I'll give you ten dollars.
Come on, I would not have peed my pants.
Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it's like someone sawed a cow in half.
That's enough.
Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?
Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don't know what else to do.
How's it going, Sheldon?
Just really glad you're back.
It's a joke.
I don't think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz's mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don't usually change. Well, they don't.
You know, I think we're zeroing in on your problem.
We haven't even gotten to my scene yet.
How you doing?
Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn't mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.
Oh.
That is not what I said.
How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it's empty?
Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?
Yeah. Come in.
Leonard…
No.
Do you have this one?
Well, I'll do what I can, but I can't make any promises.
Why? Because Sheldon's not here this week, and you don't think I have any other options? I'm just kidding. I'll get my purse.
Where are you going?
Hey.
Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.
Not from you. Let's go, Stuart.
That's how you reject a guy.
Okay. Thank you.
Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.
They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…
No.
Oh, Thursday's gone. Just Sunday left.
Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.
Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.
Oh. You mean like a museum?
How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he's looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That's where he'll be, and that's where I'm going, and…
Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he's running late.
Well, there's a bar in the lobby.
That's 'cause we're the good guys.
Name one.
Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
No, I think we're just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.
To the bedroom.
I'm sorry, I meant questions about the food.
Okay. Here's my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.
I've been on that train. And I just was again.
Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
It's feeling like it never will.
Fine, it's true. I deserve romance, and I didn't know how else to make it happen.
Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, no, no, stay there. I'm fine on the floor.
Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.
I know you don't like change, but it's not a terrible idea.
Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
Or you're the frog who's been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He's manipulating you like he always does.
Which I also figured out by myself.
I think what we're all trying to say is, you don't seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.
Forget it, Leonard. It's over.
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”
What? You've kissed, like, once in three years.
I'm not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.
You're the reason I'm doing it.
What do you guys want to do tonight?
Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?
That's some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.
Hey, I'm a famous actress living in London.
What are you talking about?
Are you having the sex talk with me?
Well, someone has to.
I'm not pouting, I'm brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.
My phone doesn't have a calendar. So I'll just write it on my hand.
Yup, we're all in.
Aren't you gonna ask?
No.
I'm so sorry.
From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?
You know what, why don't you just do it? You'll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?
I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.
No. Did you figure out what you're gonna do about the two girls?
As a matter of fact, I did. I've spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I'm gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer's going to be yes.
You look, you look really pretty tonight.
Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I've said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.
Yeah, but now you make me wonder what's wrong with you.
No.
Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?
What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?
Like you could get a brown bear.
Well, if he does, I'll see if my bear has a friend.
How does that happen?
I'm just saying…
Not so good.
Do you know what's great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That's fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.
You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.
You're right. You're right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I'll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There's a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.
That's actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.
Beach blankets, my friend, it's all about beach blankets.
I haven't been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
Penny, there's only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life's problems, and that's an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you're in a pinch.
You can't be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I'd follow Leonard on Instagram.
No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.
Yeah, she does.
You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it's truly deserved. This is malarkey.
All those people blowing their noses. You can't tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I'll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.
Uh, no, thank you.
I'm fine.
I feel like I want to cry.
Since we all agree Episode I isn't our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.
And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
Hey, we can say it. You can't.
So?
Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.
Hey, I'm a very paternal person. I'd be excellent at taking care of a baby.
Yeah, but it's not always that bad.
Oh, my God. What a day.
With your career?
Really? You guess you're in?
Me, too.
How's your mom holding up?
General cheering and congratulations.
I don't know what else we can do.
You know what? It's probably fine.
Thanks, Mom.
Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we're just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.
That's nice.
Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear back from the insurance company.
My pleasure. And I'm not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,
They do?
How were they?
Sheldon, it's okay with me that you're not perfect.
Well, I didn't say I was your father.
Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?
Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.
Just give me a minute. I'm stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.
Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
Why is it your last name and her first name?
Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?
No.
Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.
Making a straw.
Why?
Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.
Hi. What's going on?
He's practicing.
Well, not just him. May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.
No, it's yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.
How about now?
Are you kidding me?!
So when do you guys plan on getting married?
It has avocado on it. She's allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.
That was a close one.
I think so.
There's no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you're an idiot on YouTube forever.
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.
Yeah, I hope you're right.
Yeah.
Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?
Great.
It's not.
No, that won't work.
Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.
All right, night.
And snacks.
Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.
Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?
How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
Well, what do you want to do?
Oh, you will. That's why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.
It's my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.
It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.
Uh, it's kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I'll catch up with you guys later.
I'm proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It's nice to see her take it seriously.
Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold's bridle. It's an iron cage that's locked around the head and pierces the tongue.
It was us the whole time.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Ow. We didn't vote!
We didn't have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we're leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?
Hey.
Why not?
Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn't make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.
Interesting. You're suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
Save you first; come back for Raj only if there's time.
Well, I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.
Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.
Good. Little claustrophobic.
That's pretty.
Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation's commerce. It's because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I'd shake your hand, but, well, you know.
Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak.
Amy, what did you say?
I would love to see your collection.
So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it's in the basement of a urologist's house in Sherman Oaks.
Isn't she lucky?
Oh, good, you're here. Amy, I am so sorry.
Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.
Like who?
Like you and your dog.
We brought snacks for movie night.
Right here.
Ugh, thanks a lot.
Look, even Stuart's bringing a date. I wonder who it is.
Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?
And while you're at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn't mean you have to.
Sheldon, you look so handsome.
Oh, thanks, it's Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.
What makes you think I didn't go to my prom? I went.
Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.
Sheldon, this is silly. I'm not missing another prom. I'm going upstairs now. Good-bye.
Of course I understand. Sheldon, there's something else I've been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don't have to say it back. I know you're not ready, and I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictates…
Well, they weren't speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.
I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don't expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.
You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
Come on, let's talk about something other than the surgery.
Oh, muffin much.
Oh, it's nice you got him that.
I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.
Highlight 1
Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.
How come you're up so late?
What do we do? Should we call someone?
So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?
Yes. Maybe she'll feel so guilty, she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again.
I told you my plan. Let's call Building Services and get help.
Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.
You miss the blanket now, don't you?
Great. Do it.
She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
Actually, I did get you something.
Of course it is.
Well, did you tell him that?
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, I'm a problem-solver, it's what I do.
Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.
That's true.
Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.
Really?
Everything's fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
That's exactly what I told him.
Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?
Uh, Bernadette's nickname for you is the virgin piña colada.
Yes, we can.
You've been working so much lately, I'm glad you didn't forget about date night.
Come on.
That was the last one, I promise. We won't play any more.
Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.
That's not true.
We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.
Okay, we've seen plenty.
And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to  tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.
But it's personal.
Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.
Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.
No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?
Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.
No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.
Well, I'm her son, and I say it's not okay.
Get out.
Penny?
I don't know. I mean, if he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.
Come on. Sorry to bother you.
What are you talking about?
I'm so sorry.
What can we do?
Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you're talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.
Yeah, but we don't have to debate this. We're scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…
You're about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?
Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.
If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
I could've driven her.
Well, we're, we're very happy for you.
For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.
Well, he's barely moving. He looks half dead.
What are you talking about?
Well, 'cause I got it at the dirty store.
She sounds really mad.
Well, we did it.
Grass is always greener?
Try again.
I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.
Uh, at least they're talking about the theory. I mean, that's what's important.
Everything okay?
Howie.
Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.
But you got it, right?
Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
She said my name first, that must kill you.
Yay.
Will you please play the game? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.
So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself?
Oh, that's true. It's not like we can get in there.
I would do that.
I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what's the plan?
Hey, Raj. if Howard can't keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?
Yeah, what?
Eight-five.
This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?
I don't know. Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.
Hey, Raj.
Wow, so you're not curious at all?
I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.
Yeah.
I don't think I asked you.
Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you're all by yourself.
I don't know. I, I'd just like him to go away. I can't deal with this.
Wait a minute, you have a guy?
Thank you.
I don't recommend it. You'll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you're looking for Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.
I'm sorry. What do we know?
Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.
Hey.
It's, like, the best one they make, I just can't get it to work.
Nice. Where were you when I was single?
At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.
Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.
It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.
I'm cutting you off.
Oh. All right, playtime's over. Let's open this baby up.
A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.
I have the tool you wanted.
Oh. Hello. I, I didn't know he was gonna point it at me, so, don't do drugs and stay in school.
It's so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they're a bouquet of severed plant genitals.
Really? It didn't work for you.
Do you think the moms will get along?
I see.
Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.
Morning.
You must be very proud of your son.
But I wasn't. ‘Cause I didn't have any friends.
It's fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?
That's not what it is.
Oh, sure, I'd love to.
I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.
I don't know.
Yeah. I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of 'em.
Hey, I don't think she's wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.
That's right. It's called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren't moving forward in your relationship.
I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.
Ew, 50? We'll be old and gross.
Maybe. But this isn't about them, it's about us.
Well, like I said, we're about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.
Okay.
Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.
Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
You hear that? Raj is devastated.
Just tell me.
Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.
Shelly! How's my baby doing?
You can't be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you're gonna do the same with a random guy?
What do you want?
I understand we're no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.
Oh, great, there's Mandy.
Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?
I'm gonna kill him.
How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?
I don't know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.
No.
I know we're not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.
Yes.
Did you change yours to married yet?
Fine, you want me to call? I'll call. Why am I so nervous?
Great. He's pushing with his uterus.
Exactly. I'll bet there's something around here that could be a lever.
They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let's hope the lug nut expands.
What a wonderful day, thank you.
Thank you for letting me come speak with you.
Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard's moving in with Penny. It's difficult not to feel abandoned.
Have you seen this Archie comic? It's actually Archie versus Predator.
You heard him, no.
Then get out of my house.
No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.
You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.
Of course. She deserves to be happy.
Well, that's 'cause I'm doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.
You're forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
Stuart took that rejection like a pro.
I said no.
Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You're face is pleasingly symmetrical.
That kind of stinks? Why aren't you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
Hey, Barry, we're in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?
Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.
So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?
Well, so how does it work?
Remember? Don't ask too many questions?
What are you guys up to?
That must be him.
Uh, yeah, uh, right here.
Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.
That's true. There's the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.
You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?
The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine.
When did we get a wall safe?
He's not on my side. He's doing all the work for free.
‘Cause Bernie said you didn't want kids.
Do you know what that means?
So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.
And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
What? I don't want to do that.
He's cute, right?
Yeah, I should've brought my parabolic microphone.
I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.
What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they're coming right towards us.
He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
And just like that, you're a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.
I don't sound like that.
Oh, I can't. I'm going to the soup kitchen, too.
So, how does this work?
Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull 'em up?
Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?
May what?
Why would I lie?
Go ahead.
Good. I want you to be happy.
Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.
Hey, let's not pull at that thread. Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other. Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem I'm having with my current friends. Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.
You were just humming.
Hey, sweetie, why don't you take a break and do something else for a while?
Oh. That's a big step.
Why not?
Damn. I don't know if he's our biggest fan or I'm his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.
Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
Hey. We're going to the comic book store. You want to come?
Yeah, are you ready for this?
Thanks for taking me out.
I, I can't believe it. I, I don't know what to say.
Tonight's the night.
Let's do this.
I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.
Well, I didn't want to say it.
Hey.
Good news. You're an asteroid.
And not only am I Leonard's mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.
Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.
I miss you.
And it's gone.
No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.
So, was the fight really bad?
That's very mature of you.
Aha.
Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
Moon Pie.
Thank you.
You should've seen us after The Good Dinosaur.
Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.
I wouldn't say she's beautiful.
Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon's bringing me my whiskey.
She could just eat him up.
Well, no, no. I, I didn't want to mislead you after you asked me out.
Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.
Really? You know what it's like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?
Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?
Maitre d': I'm 21. How old are you?
Yeah, you know what's not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we're rooting for you.
It is freaking amazing.
Is that a big deal?
And actually, it was three different men.
No, actuawwy, I'm stiw here.
Oh, thank God.
It's not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what's under this robe, and you still married me.
Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn't good for us.
Hey, bud.
If it's thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.
I am. Of-of course I am. I'm, I'm sure it's just the hormones. But it's weird, Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I'm gonna get fat.
Oh, that sounds juicy.
What?
I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.
Nah, she's a good kid.
What's it say?
Happy birthday, Sherman.
I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.
Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.
Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.
Yeah, well, you're an engineer. End of joke, burn.
Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.
Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?
Really? I'm sorry. I swear I know other words.
Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she's having a tough time. But it's not like we're getting back together or anything.
Hello?
Uh, can you repeat that? You're breaking up.
Get a new computer.
Oh. Sorry, we can't.
It is crazy. It's also crazy that I've made fourteen of these and you've made three.
You have sporting equipment?
Okay. I get it. I get it.
What good is having a girlfriend if you can't unload your psychological sewage on her?
Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?
I'm surprised he let us conceive without him.
No.
Not the drinking game, a drinking game.
Okay, really? So you'd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?
If that's what you want to do, yes.
Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
Oh, that's Claire. Got to run.
This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
You're the only one who eats them.
Oh, of course, because I'm the only adult around here.
Don't worry, he'll come around.
No. I don't believe you. I could tell.
Tell me about it. I've had it with Raj, too.
Was it ever a dress-up party?
Oh, I honestly couldn't care less.
Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?
Where'd you get that from?
Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.
That was scary.
How come your head has your face on it?
Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.
I'm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
Of course.
Oh, but I won't be there.
Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore?
I don't know. I just don't want things to get weird.
Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn't weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.
I don't know. I really don't know.
Also, uh, cherries?
Way better.
Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
All right.
Very funny.
Uh, you know, I'm not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.
I don't think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.
Ugh. Too much wine.
Yes.
Yes. Kardashian.
That is very mature of you, so I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah.
Very well. What's the last book you read?
Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.
Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.
You would do that?
Your relationship with him is fascinating. I'm preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.
Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
I just said why, we don't like her.
I was speaking to your young lady.
I'm sorry, you find this funny?
Alfred. Thank you for coming!
No, of course not.
Really?
I don't see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.
Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat's picture on it.
I'm glad you decided to stay. It's gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
So how's the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?
Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.
Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
Oh, so am I.
That's really stupid advice.
Calm down, try not to think about it.
need to understand it, I just need to be grateful. I love you, Penny.
Thank you for taking us to the airport.
Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting's on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?
That's not what I meant.
This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don't mean and meaning things you don't say.
It had to be Barbara. I've been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
Well, thanks, but you should know we're a little concerned about this being used in weapons.
Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant. She wasn't ready for them to know.
Yeah, come on in.
Impressive.
Well, I don't know, midnight, one.
Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.
The first one's free? Flash, how do you stay in business?
We can't afford to lose any more time.
That's me, I'm her. You know, he didn't trick me, he just wore me down.
No, I can't figure out the math. I've been racking my brain for days, and I've got nothing.
I can't do it. I'm not as smart as I think I am. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.
Very well. I'm on board.
Are we being silly not finding out the sex?
I don't know. I didn't count.
This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn't get you all worked up, I'd kiss you right now.
You, too. Oh, don't forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.
Well, I'm not refusing. I'm just trying to be considerate.
Really? I slept great.
Good.
Great.
Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
Leonard breathes on me, too. It's not a big deal.
And you're starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That's like getting your first pet and having it be, I don't know, what's a kind of pet that ruins your life?
Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm's probably bigger than the other.
I know. It's also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first
Okay.
What do you do in there?
Yeah, you're probably right.
I kind of went the other way.
I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.
Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don't have a crib, we don't have diapers, we're not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!
Well, thanks.
Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
Okay, let's keep it moving.
I am.
Really, no one else is coming?
Stuart, you know you're one of our favourite people.
Fine, we'll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.
Why is it taking so long?
Oh. Thank you.
No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I'm not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?
I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.
Bye.
You know what I love about you?
Not me, I'm a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.
So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don't want me to tell you?
Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.
Amy, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.
You guys might want to start eating. But you won't be living here.
Sorry, you brought it up?
I'm kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.
Do you like living with her?
I'm just contemplating Buridan's donkey.
What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let's
You know, most people don't realize this technique has actually been around for a few years.
He's studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.
Ay, Rajesh, I think you're very sweet, but I work two jobs and I don't have time for dating.
Hey, you're talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man.
You told him I was an astronomer?
I can keep this, right?
You're very persistent.
Yeah, but you've got all those things, and no one's lining up to be you.
Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone's jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I'll be out of things to wish for.
We, hang on, you're my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I'm my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I'm good to go.
It's fine. I've been on The Simpsons.
Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.
Leonard.
Well, you know what's gonna happen, he's just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.
You know what? There is one thing I would like.
But you don't even understand its symbolism.
Thank you again for cooking. It's getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
Uh, can I help you?
I like the painting. Is that your mom?
Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.
You promise?
I'll pull the van up.
Team Baby, go.
Raj.
And the mood continues to change.
Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
Bernadette got her doctorate.
I'm the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn't power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.
What?
Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.
You do make a cute elf.
Time lapse.
Do not need a break.
To this day I've never touched Stuart.
No they're not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can't?
Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.
Is it okay if I get some sleep?
I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.
Leonard, i've been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?
Penny, is it weird that we're having girls' night here, but you don't live here any more, so it's basically my girls' night?
I don't want to talk about it.
Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.
