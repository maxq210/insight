I want to leave.
Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
Oh, hi!
Oh… uh… no… we don't live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.
It took you four years to get through High School?
No.
I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbour.
Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
Wait till you see this.
I'm sorry?
A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.
Hello.
This is it.  I'll do the talking.
So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?
So Penny's a little messy.
Sheldon!
Sarcasm?
Stay away from me.
Hey Raj.  Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I'm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?
Um, here's the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research….
One package, Phillips head screws.
These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
You betrayed us for money, who are you?
No, I'm not jealous, I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.
I smell robot.
But I thought you wanted to cancel?
Why would she be expecting me?
Can I get you started with some drinks?
It's time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.
Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.
Well think about it, it's a product that doesn't spoil, and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.
Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?
Leonard called me.
To my room, and no-one's allowed in.
Sounds like a wise man.
I'll be back.
Well, it's all good.
Yeah, sure, why not.
Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?
Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.
Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign's been changed.
Who told you you could touch my board?
Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.
Who wouldn't?
Woah, Leonard, please, you're smothering me.
I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.
A boy-girl party?
Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.
Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here.
Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.
Yes you are.
Watch this, it's really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
If we're all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.
Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.
No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where's Howard?
Hmmph, wrong.
FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.
I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?
Ah, well then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.
Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christie stay with me.
Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four.
Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.
Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.
The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
What are you guys doing here?
Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!
And now you're out of life. Why did you hit pause?
Why?
Oh, that's nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer.
Hi guys.
Haven't you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.
No, no, let's see how long it takes him.
We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?
You Indian.
Oh.
What?
Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.
What just happened?
Okay, well, good night.
Okay, thanks.
No, no, no, you don't get it, um, Howard, enable public access.
Oh, you admit that it's our work.
Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put's fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy!”
Okay, well, let's just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.
I don't understand the question.
Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.
Yeah. What the hell was that?
As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offence.
I've had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.
Is this usually how these physics things go?
I don't know, but if cats could sing, they'd hate it too.
Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.
It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.
I think that's a week from Tuesday at six.
Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.
We're going to Long Beach?
We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.
You still told her I lied.
I don't know what to say.
No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.
Good for you.
Oh…!
But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.
By the end. Yeah.
And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.
I… I don't…
Leonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.
Hey.
I want soup.
Yes,
I know it's the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.
Howard' Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.
Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.
You want me to get eye surgery?
Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.
Dr Gablehouser.
Is this part of the tour?
Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.
Not heavy ones.
You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it?
Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab.
Great.
Is he here?
Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?
I really don't understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn't the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?
Thank you.
Like what? We can't get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
No, I have allergies.
And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!
Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's offputting.
And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.
Because it's polite.
He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.
So nothing, let's destroy him.
So, is that your team.
Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation.
How do you know anything about physics?
My Physics Bowl Trophy!  “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”
No, a time machine from Sophie's Choice.
Fifteen seconds.
Yeah, I know, I still can't afford it.
Why don't we share it? We'll each put in two hundred bucks and we'll take turns having it in our homes.
In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”.
For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous.
You can't just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it's at my friends house,” how lame is that?
Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?
Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.
Why?
Because I don't want it any more.
Just… personal reasons.
Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.
Will you forget dibs!
You hypocrite!
No, I needed to hear it.
I guess that makes me large breasts.
Yeah.
Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and… I'm sorry what was your name again.
My friend's getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.
Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.
You still have to wear a helmet.
Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.
Uh-huh.
How so?
Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God's special little people.
What's the difference?
he can scrape it off.
So you've really never had a birthday party?
I know. I want to talk to you.
What would we talk about? We've no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of, and you know I don't care for chit-chat.
Uh, Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.
How's it going?
So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.
Oh, okay then this one.
Yeah, I suppose.
Get out of my ER.
We can't go home.
Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy.
Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.
Oh, it's okay.
How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.
Hey!
I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.
Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.
I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.
We're not done?
Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight.
Right.
Do you want some.
They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that's my home run swing.
You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
No.
How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
I'm Batman. Shhhhh!
You're nitpicking.
Hello.
Yes I have, it's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
Yeah, sure.
What happened to Chows?
I know. I heard.
You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.
Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel's fortress. Now this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we'll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.  Sheldor is AFK.  Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?
Oh.
Okay.  Wait, wait, where are you going?
No, that's what she said, Sheldon.
Okay, well you were great, thanks.  Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don't got in Sheldon's room, he's not wearing bottoms.
Why should I do something, you're the one who introduced her to online gaming.
Penny- I said not now.
Hey, what's with him?
Mmmm, testify.
Well, wow, that's incredible.
I'm confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
Peer review? It's People magazine. People picked me.
Good night.
Terrific.
So you're just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?
My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.
Goodnight, Sheldon.
Sheldon, it's fine.
Too bad.
I said, get out.
We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you'll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.
Damn, there's always a catch.
No, Dr. Cooper.
On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.
So have you worked out the neutrino issue?
He did.
Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn't waste an evening playing video games.
I know it's hard, but he's a gift to the whole world, and we can't be selfish.
Yes. She's in the living room. Go, I'll wait here.
You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.
It's unbelievable! It's paradigm-altering!
And I could not have done it without you.
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I'm Kathy O'Brien. I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.
I'm just so… full.
Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.
Yes.
Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.
March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.
Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.
Look, here's the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.
Ow.
You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
Oh, snap.
No, you're mistaken.
I can't tell you that, either.
So how was work today?
Oh, she's a doctor.
Howard' Howard, get the door!
Sheldon.
Not the right seats. (Sheldon moves around the theatre sitting in various seats and shouting “Ha!”)
Stephanie Barnett is single.
She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.
Look at Leonard's record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
May I come in?
No.
I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.
Leonard, there's one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I'm calling an emergency meeting.
That's absurd.
Oh, she is. She's terrific, and she's proving to be a valuable roommate.
Okay, well, I ju… I think it's important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!
I just ate, aren't you supposed to wait an hour?
Your pants are ruined.
Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.
I have two words for you. The first is big, the other's whoop.
Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.
Hey, guys!
Ooh, “Dave.” Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.
Why is that so surprising?
The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.
What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It's as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.
Come on, bath stuff, it's perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.
Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!
You ready to go?
Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn't want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what's up with that?
Nice save, genius. Eggnog?
Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.
Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.
I'm going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.
He's not with a… does it really matter who or what he's with? The guy is devastated.
So, you're okay?
That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?
It is extracted from the plant…
Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults. Vewy impwessive!
Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn't bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
I assumed he was joking. You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
Hello Sheldon.
Sheldon, I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.
Yes, he's new at the zoo.
Suddenly I'm looking pretty good, huh?
I'm sowy. No, my fwiend?
Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can't. Sheldon honey, I don't want things to be weird between us.
All right.
Did you guys have an argument?
It was fourteen fifty, but it's okay.
Where are you going?
Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they're not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it's just, like… Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here?
That's it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
What's that about?
You must be Leonard's mother.
Uh, why don't you come with me. I'll walk you to the apartment.
Oolong?
Warmed separately?
Yes.
So, Mother, what's new?
So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.
Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.
Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.
Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
Geez, what a fun couple.
Of course she did. Anyway, that's not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.
Ummm, I'm gonna go with “no.”
We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
That's great, Leslie. Thanks.
Is that why you didn't cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
Fine.  Happy?
Yes!
Thank you.
That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don't eat in my desk chair and I don't work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.
What about it?
There's one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.
Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober.
Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?
Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.
Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.
Thank you.
Santa Barbara.
So, Penny has a don't knock on my door before eleven o'clock  or I punch you in the throat rule.
Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don't want to see naked.
And you're going to let her handle my food?
I think you're just making that up.
All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc's 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.
Let's go. We're going to miss the coming attractions.
Where?
Okay, what's wrong with it?
I believe I'm hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
You're right, of course.
Time shift
Leonard?
Hey.
Oh, actually I'm, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she's also my maid.
Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?
Yes.
Oh, I'd watch that.
Yum. Starving.
About what?
I had to, she called me cutie.
You're joking.
Why would I gamble? It's mine. Let go.
A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?
Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.
It's Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?
I'm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
Nah, they're eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.
No.
Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
Yes
I believe it's my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you're ready.
I don't want to go anywhere.
I've never been there, have you?
Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.
Damn it. What do you want me to do
Smell that? That's the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!
I'm sorry.
Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
Hey, Leonard.
It must be hell inside your head.
Um…
What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work. No way to mount it.
How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don't go.
Just imagine. If he says yes, we'll have an entire summer without Sheldon.
Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…
I'm still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.
Sheldon.
No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
Yeah. I'm just a little surprised you didn't tell me.
Yes, obviously.
Yeah.
There's no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
He's speaking about it.
I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.
I couldn't even think of anyone else while you were gone.
But I would like to remind you that in science, there's no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man's name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.
Man, I can not catch a break.
Really?
Aw, Mom.
I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
To what? Toy Story?
Okay, first of all…
You're good-naturedly ribbing me, aren't you?
Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
Because I like peppermint, and it's fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?
His name isn't Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast's Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.
Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I'll suck nothing. Of course I'm joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
What do you have a safe deposit box for?
Right, right. You're saying you talked to Penny?
Why not?
We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.
Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…
Fine, whatever. Are you finished?
Um, yeah, sure, thanks.
You know, I've always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.
Uh, yeah, I think we'll pass.
Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip.
Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.
Oy vay.
I'm not. And Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.
You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?
Uh, yeah!
With my luck, hepatitis
When we tell this story, let's end it differently.
Mmm, these are so good
Tur-briska-fil?
So, what's going on with Raj?
Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
For me. You're going to have to listen more carefully when you're on the job.
I'm impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.
I'm sorry, I believe you've misunderstood. I'm not giving you the job. I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we'll get started with the interview.
You are a dirty girl.
There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?
No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we'd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.
In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.
Are you sure?
Yeah, well, it's your fault.
Oh, wow. You didn't, did you?
A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.
Well, this sucks.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, are you under the impression that we're still friends?
Please, I'm asking you as a friend.
Stipulated.
Sheldon, come in.
Nice meeting all of you.
No. This is our day.
Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It's like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.
Why not?
So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you're now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?
Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
You know what? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.
No, we just had a little spat.
Oh, yeah? well, there's a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!
Great.
I don't follow.
My singing?
That's actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it.
Stop knocking! It's open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can't come home for my cousin Sanjay's wedding.
Yeah, he's, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.
I've heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I'm hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf, and my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.
What?
Well, it seems we've reached an impasse.
Look, they gave me homemade cookies.
Good idea. They'll be refreshed.
Hot dogs, buns, s'mores, I mean, it's a freaking 7-11.
Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
You're a real douche.
Excuse me, may I interject?
Six-four.
You flatter me, sir.
Womenfolk?
Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.
It's not about shoes, is it? I don't think I could go through that again.
Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
I have to take notes?
Huh?
Oh, that explains a lot.
All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.
It's up to you. He didn't call your experiment stupid.
You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Oh, yes, that's right. The weekend after Leonard's dog died.
Thank you, that's very comforting.
Hey, Bev, guess what?
Yeah, not bad, not bad.
Once again, I'm driving. I'm right here.
All right. Well, I'm going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
Dude, there's so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it's a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy's. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.
If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?
No. I'm looking for a hookup.
Okay. What is your game?
The mysterious subcontinent of India.
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.
Laser.
little triple intersection is your ideal mate. Odds are she's a short physicist with low self-esteem who lives in a government research facility in China.
No, I'm not jealous. All right, I'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid. Now, can we order?
Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It's all right. They didn't take my comic books.
When does the CSI team get here?
I do tonight. It's scary over there.
Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
Is he quitting his job at the university?
Help you with your bags, sir?
Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
You're right.  It's a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
Want my corn?
I don't know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.
Impaired cognitive function.
But I don't want to go to bed.
You can try, but you'll never catch me.
And that didn't work out, did it?
Oh.
Oh, heavens, no. Since I don't need to be paid, I didn't need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.
Thank you.
Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
Sheldon, you got a minute?
Yeah, well, I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day with a girl since I was six.
We're going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
You seen Sheldon?
Morning, old chum.
What you're tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you've finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.
Very well. Enjoy yourself. You're going to be in the presence of something that I've dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
Yes, that good news.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.
I'm not going to pay a fine. That would imply I'm guilty.
Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
Penny.  Penny.
And who performed that heroic act?
You called it.
Are you Stan Lee?
Don't panic, this is better.
My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That's why I'm the funny one.
We can't sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.
I think it's lovely you call your mommy and let her know you're going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn't breast-feed on time, it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.
Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don't you go after Raj's mother?
Subliminal messaging. I'm going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that's 24-7, buddy.
Where the hell d'you find that?
How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
Oh, Lord, this couldn't be any more humiliating.
Oh. Oh. Thank you.
Okay, good night, sweetie.
Would that be a giant rat's ass?
What? No.
I'm just asking, dude. It happens.
That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?
I, um, I want you to know that even though we're on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.
Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That's not what we're doing tonight. Tonight we're just throwing a ball at some pins.
No!
Yeah, you are! Just back off!
Are you insane? If she leaves, it's over!
Good. Keep thinking that.
God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
Right.
Harsh terms. But all right, I'll just substitute intercourse.
Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!
Oh, God, I feel terrible.
Do you have a stomach ache, too?
I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.
Nope.
We're home.
Yep, okay.
Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?
Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You're having a woman stay with you?
All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.
All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There's a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.
Sleep well, my friend.
Me neither. Oh, look what I'm reading. It's you.
Really? Uh, sure doesn't read that way.
Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
Excuse me. I'm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.
What the hell are you doing?
Uh, yeah.
Good?
It's just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!
So Sheldon's last roommate tried to warn you off?
As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I'm not saying I would have.
Oh, yeah, I'm wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.
Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.
Why?
I like it.
Me, too.
Nice.
Not correctly.
That's not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.
It's not like that, I'm watching someone's TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.
My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.
Your company?
Let me explain what we're doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.
Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
That's your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?
I was wrong. Penny can do better.
Look, I said I'm sorry. Can't u please let it go?
Excuse me?
Okay, I'm out.
Haughty derision it is.
Okay, fine. When's the date?
My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.
You know, there's something I've always wondered about Aquaman.
So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you're a neuro something-or-other.
All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?
What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It's over 14 hours in Southern California.
Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?
You can always get a badger and find out.
What?
No, no, no, no. You're right. We're not going out anymore, I should pay for myself.  What?
Sheldon, six bucks.
No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.
Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.
Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?
Yeah, I've been reading up on biomechanics. I think you'll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!
Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon's face, appears). Greetings, friends.
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
I am looking at you.
No, it's not.
Sheldon- Be a lamb and open it for me.
Why? What's the problem?
Sheldon- I must speak to him.
You know, there's an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.
Sheldon- Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?
Defend.
In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?
What?
Okay.
I believe she's experiencing her menses.
It's how they lure you in. I believe it's called bait and switch.
I tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.
John and Yoko.
Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.
Oh, Penny? Penny?
Great, Ma!
You're being unreasonable. Why can't I have a desk?
Sheldon.
Oh, I'd rather not say.
Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.
Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?
Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story.
Knock yourself out.
Yes.
Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
Thank you.
Not where I can hear you guys.
Did Penny tell you about that?
Listen to me, Howard, it's time. Make the move, now.
You said, well, the move, remember?
Probably. What's your point?
That's what she said.
Thank you.
All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don't guard the shirts.
Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend. How do I look?
What are you working on?
Hi, Amy. Sheldon's not here.
Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it's actually extremely plausible.
Alright, this goes without saying, but I'm just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
Dude, that's my sister you're talking about.
Train day?
Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.
I'm not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that's not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.
I came to go over your alibi for last night.
It's pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn't even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.
May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.
Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?
Because you feel guilty?
Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That's it.
Howard, you're feeling better about me today, aren't you?
Oh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.
Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 Nemesis?
Hysterical!
Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls' night tonight.
Well, that's disappointing. I've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.
It's fine, it's fine. Go back to sleep.
Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?
Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it's only going to upset you.
And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.
And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.”
I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
That was odd.
You'll never guess what just happened.
Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.
Well I'd like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.
Maybe.
Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you're a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who'll want to kiss you.
Excuse me?
Hey.
Hey.
Did he get superpowers?
It's too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it's fine.
Zack.
Hoo.
All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.
Let's look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.
Every idea is better than this idea.
Wait. What the hell is ding?
Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.
Ice Dragon.
You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it'll just come back to life.
Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I'm stupid.
Penny.
Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.
Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I'm not going.
No. Wait, wait, does it?
Oh.
Ten, nine, eight…
Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?
Hey, wait a minute.
All right, let's get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.
We're not playing. This is real work.
The what?
Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?
Well, it's a table, right? I mean, why can't there be food on it?
I missed you.
Oh. Nice to meet you.
Bye.
We are?
Well, I'm not getting in bed with him.
Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.
Must be out of range.
Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.
I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.
Aw, I'm gonna miss you. Are you going with him?
I have to stay here for school.
So, while I'm gone, you're going to have to satisfy her.
The Technique of Acting, Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting, and Henry Winkler's Heyyy, I'm an Actor.
Yes. I didn't care for it.
You're thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
Nice place. Reminds me of my parents' house back in New Delhi.
They're cute when they're about to wet themselves, aren't they? I'll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?
Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.
Um, I'm not sure.
Okay, we can't keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.
Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
Oh, please.
Ah, there he is! The man of the hour! He took one for the team!
Me too.
Well, I'd love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.
No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.
There's no room. His sister is staying with him.
No, no. I'll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever's troubling you.
Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.
Hello.
No, wait. You didn't let me finish.
No.
Why?
I'm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.
Just sit here.
Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it's Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer's Stone.
Don't be needy, bestie. That's probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we'd all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.
Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
Weally? That's your question?
Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
All my friends.  All my friends.  All my friends.
Is that your card?
I don't care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you're not ready to move on.
No, no-no-no, I'm ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that's not moving on, what is?
You don't sound very confident.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
No.
I'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one's been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.
Okay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.
No, no, I do. It's just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.
It doesn't matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.
Hey!
I don't know.
Hold on. I'm talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he'll help us track down your things.
Ah, here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.
You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.
There's no reason to worry.
Hello, Priya. What's up? How would I know if Leonard's at work or not? Don't be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you're going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.
I can't believe we're going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
Next time we go to kick someone's ass, we take the train.
Yeah, she doesn't really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.
Todd Zarnecki was mean.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you're in a comedy club.
Shooting at a target?
Fine, don't tell me.
Hey!
You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
We're very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can't complain.
Please tell me you're not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?
Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India's a goofy place.
Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.
Did he mean as if she'd been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?
This is moving faster than we thought.
Oh, hold on, Howard. There's lots of better times.
You will?
What kind of emergency?
Why did you bring him? He's harshing my buzz.
I'm certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?
Eight.
Okay, I'll sign it!
Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.
Yeah, yeah. I'm just breaking in some new shoes.
Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?
He's a consultant.
Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.  What do you got for me, wildebeest?
Oh, please, you're not that kind of person.
I'm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.
She's a lovely girl. Cute as a button.
Alright, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.
I can't.
Well, he's my friend. It's what you do.
That's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.
I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.
Oh, God, that's so true.
To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
Relax, he's got headphones on. And we're ten miles above Earth in a starship.
Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!
Can I sleep here tonight?
Scotty, I need more power.
As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that. Please sign.
This is the difference between eating and dining.
My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh, nice touch, by the way.
Yeah.
Oh, you poor baby.
I've been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
Why do you care so much? You're dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.
It's all over her Facebook page.
Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend.
Give it a second to load. Whenever you're ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they're out of sunblock, which means they'll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That's our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won't know what hit them. All right, let's move out.
Fine with me.
Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I've been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It's time for me to move back to Nebraska.
Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?
Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?
I'm proud of you.
You know, some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance. They'd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It's probably just buffering, just give it a second.
Kiss me where I've never been kissed before.
I don't think so.
Aren't you worried about it being unhygienic?
No, it's completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
Hang on. You seriously think I'm going to live with your mother?
Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that's exactly what he thinks.
Why not? It's a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom's there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.
Well, it wasn't spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.
Ah, sure. That'd be nice.
Hey. I don't want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
No, thank you. I'm really not much of a dancer.
I just can't figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.
Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny's door)
Morning, Mom.
I say, hey Ma, what's for dinner?”
You see a dragon.
Uh, no, that's not it. Just come with me, please.
What's it thinking about now?
Really? That's the first thing you want to say?
Look, I know they have money. I don't think it's that much.
Well, so how much is that?
No. I'm the one that introduced him to her. I've got to say something.
You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you're cut off.
I know, I know.
It's from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
Man, you're killing me!
Okay, if you're going to question the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!
I'm not surprised.
I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.
Oh, God, you're right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.
You're my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn't show up.
Ten.
What's the last thing you were ever happy about?
Are ya?
Coffee.
Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I'm going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?
Nope. She says if I don't back out she's going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.
I don't know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.
The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.
Great. Now, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.
All right, Mom. When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son, believe it, because it's true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard's hand)
Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn't have hair on your chest.
Later.
You're kidding. You have your own book?
You're sure it's not weird.
So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
You are. I'm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we've only got one shot.
But?
Uh, not so good. We have to talk.
Uh, kind of?
Okay, that time you looked at me.
Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I'm good at this.
Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?
Amy, we're really sorry.
No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.
What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let's see some skin.
Well, I'm going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?
Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.
Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.
It's a working title.
Uh, right.
If that's so, what if I start talking to a girl?
Oh, he's a sweetie.
So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?
Huh? I'm sorry, get what?
No, no. I want to know what you told her.
A… S… Take me home.
Okay, I'm not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.
A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can't be used as a floatation device.
Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?
If I tell you that, I'm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin' tootin' low price of $24.95.
Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.
Thank you.
Sure.
Scrotum.
A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey's Kisses to your nipples.
No.
Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.
You'll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.
Glad I could help.
Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don't want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn't the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let's see how you like this waffle!
Fine, go ahead.
Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It's a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.
Ooh!
How about this?
Yeah, okay, no.
Absolutely not. Look, we're just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.
Where on earth did you get that from?
Okay, uh, let's see. I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I've done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.
Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.
He's got to be doing this on purpose.
Well, I'm a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.
Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?
Well, then, I guess it's plausible. Hang on a second, mister.
Here's two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
Well, hey, we're grown-ups. We can still be friends.
Why not?
People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I'd like to place my order.
Me, too, I missed you.
So, have a good night.
What am I doing? I'm talking with you.
Barry' I don't know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.
See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.
Uh-huh.
Emergency preparedness drill.
Check it out, press release from NASA.
Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo' Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova' Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.
They put you under for a cleaning?
Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall.  ‘Sup?
I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
What are you proposing?
Not now!
My mom. Sorry.
Gamma.
Isn't that just Feynman's idea?
I'm sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?
No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
What are you doing here?
I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.
Professor Rothman.
Oh, he's just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.
I get it.
Good night, real Penny.
I feel like an idiot.
If you're not happy, why don't you just let Kripke have the office?
Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, 'cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.
Help! Somebody help!
Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.
Hi.
Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.
Oh, no, no, I'm just here to get my hair cut.
Why did you get bongos?
Gummy bears? Thank you.
I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she's parking the car right now.
Not just my first boyfriend, he's the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.
Pew!
Bernadette, remember, your character's the healer in our group. You're in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.
C'mon can't we just open one up and take a…
Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.
Well I am unhappy.
Look, Howard, you're in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.
Mmm.
Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn't going to make any sense to you.
Still going to introduce him?
Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.
See, there it is, there's that twinkle.
I know.
I know.
All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I'll just snack on this sunlight.
And gas money to get home.
Sheldon…
Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one's my favourite!
Why didn't you tell me
You must be burning up.
Okay, at some point, we'll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don't we just start doing that now?
You're right, he is! Your dad's gonna be furious. There's no way he's gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.
Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol' ladies.
Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He's dead now.
Right, right.
You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud.
Um, okay.
Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?
They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn't mean they hand them out to you when you go.
Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.
I'll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.
There's fuel leaking and we're still going to go?
Who is it?
You'll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
Attaboy!
I can. How are you?
I'm amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it's all so unbelievable.
How clear is the image of me on that screen?
Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you've always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.
Raj.
All right. Great.
Thanks for fixing it. I love you.
Ew, why?
Yeah, sure, of course I love him.
Excuse me. I'm talking to my friends.
Sheldon, you are not in charge.
What's the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn't want to sit by myself.
It's not fair. Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.
So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches' brew of his soda and spit?
How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They're fish with a sword for a nose.
I'm starting to get a sense of it. Don't worry. I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
What's wrong? You look upset.
Hey, how's my little astronautie hottie?
Really, you're serious? Okay.
So, you're going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable. (Entering Sheldon's office) Hey, Sheldon, hope you're hungry, they're serving macaroni and…  che-ee-ee-ese.
She seems nice.
We're not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz
The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don't have one for falling out of space! We did it! We're on the ground! We survived!
Oh, it's just me.
I am now that you're back. Come on, let's go home so I can tear off those little pants.
Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.
Penny, aren't you gonna draw something?
No good, Sheldon doesn't float.
Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.
You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.
Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  just be information  on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.  So it's possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.
Yeah. You got a problem with that?
Hey, hey, look at you guys!
It was a compromise. I lost.
You, out! You are being very rude.
Just what?
You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.
Oh. That's great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?
There's the problem. You can't beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy's a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.
All right, hotshot, let's hear your Indian.
Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking's not busy because I can see he's playing other people right now.
I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.
I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.
Oh, me, too.
Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I'll see you at dinner tonight?
Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.
Fine. It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us, because the buffet you're about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That's it. End of story. Good night.
I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I'm doing.
Penny, please, I think I've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.
No, she won't.
That's a lot for a kid to deal with.
You know, she's why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she'd smile. For a few minutes, she'd forget how lonely she was.
Aw, crap. Let's go.
Where we going?
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down.
I'm looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.
Oh, just this guy I met at school.
What did he say?
Well, it's your word against mine; see you in court.
You think you don't care?
What do you mean?
Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks. I'm, I'm way above average in a lot of other things.
Hey.
Trust me, it doesn't.
Okay, picture's up. Looks like the camera's working.
Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.
Good boy. Here's a cookie.
If and when?
He wasn't using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
Wait, I'm leaving my car here?
Okay, Howard's mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.
Oh, no. Where was it parked?
You had my car towed.
Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?
He's trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.
Just say it.
What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?
Well, not with that attitude.
Maybe we should start with that.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
Yes.
I don't have a bath thermometer.
I got better two days ago. It's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.
I don't mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.
Maybe in cartoons.
By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
Fine. Howard, what do you do?
No!
Thanks.
Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
Not that I can think of.
Yes. What, is there a problem?
Well, if you want, you can come with me.
You look like my little cousin when he's dropping one in his diaper.
What do you guys think I should do?
What is happening?
That's great.
I'm a what?
It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.
Well, it's a lot smaller. It's more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.
It's a comic book convention. You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one's still pretty good.
GPS (in Sheldon's voice): Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.
Oh, my God. Leonard, someone's stealing your car!
Hmm, okay, I'm done. How did you guys finish so fast?
You can't pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.
There's only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
Wait. They might be hostile.
So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?
You're still out, right?
I have some bad news. You're working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I'm working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.
You! Always bet on black.
What do we have to lose?
See?
I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.
We do?
So?
What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.
Yes, but we're married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don't like it, but that's how love works.
I know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.
Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
Oh, my God!  Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?
Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
He's got Amy now.
Yeah. Okay, all right, don't freak out. You can make this work.
Tell me one reason why this isn't a fantastic idea.
Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn't ready for.
You wore my pyjamas?
Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?
Yes.
Um…
There must be something we can do.
Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?
Want to come to dinner with us?
Uh, where what is?
She hid my Xbox like I'm a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.
Oh, my God, yes. Of course I'll marry you.
Two can play this game. Penny…
Oh, yeah, think about it. We'd hang out, we'd read comic books, we'd see movies. It'd be like the best relationship ever.
Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine's Day sucks.
Hello.
Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?
No. No, after everything you didn't do for me tonight, I want you to have it.
I think you're cool.
Okay.
Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn't the compliment it sounds like.
Come on, buddy, open up.
Raj, what's going on?
Subtle, but powerful.
Why would I do that?
Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?
Sorry. Can you just give him this?
Oh, no, I can't stay.
Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you'll see.
To be lonely?
She's remarkable.
Sheldon, you're always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
Me, too.
Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o'clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I'm going to Disneyland.
My battery's dying, so I'm just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I've been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I'm gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that's okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.
Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can't do both. This isn't sex.
Trying to paint a picture.
I can't do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn't respect my husband's privacy?
Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
There's nothing to worry about. Your secret's safe with me.
Hey.
She'd be proud, huh?
You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.
Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
Where have you been?
Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.
Oh, what a jerk.
You're all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom's going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?
What? That was ambiguous.
Well, now it's biguous. What are you gonna do about it?
Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
Well, you're an excellent neuroscientist, you're a wonderful girlfriend, and…
That's not ridiculous. Good night.
Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o'clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we'd join him in progress.  It's him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
Is, uh, is he dangerous?
That's too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
I, I figured that out.
But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o'clock, you'd come to my house on Channel 68, and we'd do science together. If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows what would've become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could've wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
He's not a relative, he's not allowed, right?
You have her?
No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.
Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
So, in a way it's like I'm your son.
Oh, that's nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.
Kind of funky.
I'm sorry.
Ooh!
And now what?
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.
Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
Ignore him. He's a little nervous 'cause he doesn't think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.
What the? Are you crazy? You can't talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
Yeah, it does, and here we are.
Yeah.
It's not a competition.
Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.
Oh, dear Lord, a police officer's glancing in our direction. We've been made.
The hotel's nice. There's a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun.
I will.
No, it's a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!
Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.
There was.
Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!
Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
Oh, my God. You weren't supposed to be here till Sunday.
Aquaman? Oh, this isn't a gag gift, Stuart.
Ooh, yeah, I don't know. This squirt gun, it's, uh, it's pretty rare.
And I'm gonna hit the head. That's what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
That's nice.
No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet's been doing that. I called the building manager, so…
Hi, honey.
I made some brownies. You want one?
This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you've been wearing gloves.
You're full of oestrogen and you don't act like that.
I'm sorry. I'm just distracted by something that happened over at Penny's.
Aha.
No, he doesn't.
Please leave me out of this.
Ooh, now we're talking.
So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy's girlfriend is my enemy.
Can't believe we forgot to tell him.
I didn't tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.
Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, 'cause one of you is lying.
That's 'cause I'm a woman. I've had years of practice riding the dragon.
What?
It was fine.
Ooh, now we're talking.
No, I don't.
Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
You want to take the bus to work?
Think of me when you apply it.
Why?
Stop that. Penny is not a liability.
Not with a bowling ball on their back.
To the Neil Mobile.
What? Why me?
Are you kidding me?
Run.
You bought my mom's book?
No.
I'm so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.
Well, that's not how we're going to do it.
Do you feel better?
Oh, no, I got bored with that. I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.
Sheldon, don't defecate where you eat means don't have a romantic relationship in the workplace.
Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.
Please let me be there when you tell her that.
It's nothing in particular. I…
Please, stop talking.
Gentlemen.
Well, now, that.
Oh, hi.
Ah.
Oh, I love that.
Yeah. Hey, how come you've never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?
And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you've done for me?
Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.
Let's see, what's next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.
And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You're fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn't the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.
The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
You're not?
And he'd definitely still live with his mom.
I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, 'cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.
Stop it, you're gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.
Sorry.
Sheldon (not in Amy's daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory): Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?
I've never seen him this happy before.
Trust me, I, I remember.
Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?
Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.
No. Wait, I want to guess. Don't tell me.
You don't want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn't done any real science in decades.
This is fun. I'm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn't have a list of medications I'm allergic to.
Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It's an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.
Oh, God.
Yeah, they, they hate that.
He can't help it. He can't. He really can't.
I said I would.
Well, I don't know how to do that.
I'm telling you, try the hanger.
Why is the key always confidence? How come it's never love handles and flop sweat?
I'm gonna go with sad. So what's the story with you and this DVD?
Oh, oh, no, no. It's because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn't a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I'm not Armenian, so it probably won't work. This is over, right?
They're real.
Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate. You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.
Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.
Great, well, what do I have to do?
Um, I don't know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.
Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we're gonna talk about the rest of the day?
I've kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?
I don't care for your mother's bathroom. There's not an angle to do one's business without a clown figurine staring at you.
Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you're right there to make me feel even worse about it.
Not cool, bro. I'm starting to think you're not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.
That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.
Sheldon.
I'm sorry, too.
Yeah, well, I'm not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.
Yeah, I know a little something about that.
Good.
Thank you, Raj.
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don't publish it, it's just a matter of time before someone else does.
Come on, don't give him a hard time.
That is not… he's doing it again.
Oh, I hope it's just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.
All right, here's the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.
Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc
Well…
The end.
Doesn't matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It's some kind of dirty magic show.
At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.
I know you're starving. The neighbours know you're starving. There's starving people in Africa who know you're starving.
What are you doing?
Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you're in the mix.
And? How did it make you feel?
Why is that funny? That's just unhygienic.
Not at all.
Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?
And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.
Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?
Um…
Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?
It's all right.
Does that mean the relationship is over?
Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.
Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you'd like to join.
What?! No, he doesn't.
Let me guess.
The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn't take some other job in case it didn't work out. Which wasn't easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.
Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can't Leonard understand it?
Weren't you?
I don't think I like the way you're treating my friend.
No, don't.
Fine. I'm not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn't you ask me before you did it?
Yeah, well, maybe we do.
Refresh… Refresh… Refresh…
To be cool? Yeah.
Yes, I'm starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven't even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.
Does he sound like a criminal?
Yeah. Or you'd be the oldest one here.
It is. I feel alive.
Oh, no. I'd be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?
I thought you were a badass.
How much chocolate did she eat?
Sorry.
Or was there?
What?
A world I don't want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.
Hold on to your conductor's hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.
Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.
Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don't hesitate to call.
I'm thinking about growing a goatee.
Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there's nothing I can do about it.
She's right, a committee that important should meet more often.
Hi, honey.
What's going on?
Hello?
Why can't Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.
Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
I don't want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
Have you heard back from Emily?
You sure you want to do this?
I'm leaving.
He's in Texas, he'll never know.
I don't know.
I'm leaving.
I already am. I'm bringing the gift of knowledge.
Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.
Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he's just ripping off Terminator?
Okay, give me the flowers and pie.
What does your card say, Bernadette?
Or I will send you to your room.
Aw.
That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn't go smoothly with your mom.
What did you do?
Are you having the sex talk with me?
Get? Hang on. I don't feel like you're taking this dilemma seriously.
No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.
Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?
Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
Good night.
Me, either.
Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.
You look, you look really pretty tonight.
Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I'm sorry. I can't do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I'm seeing her Saturday, And I'm glad you like it, it's from J. Crew.
But I haven't decided yet.
What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?
Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
It's sweet that he thinks there's a story.
Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?
Well, my mom doesn't have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.
You're a good friend. I owe you one.
But none of that means we don't love you.
Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we've seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We've seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.
Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.
Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She's gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn't normally do.
Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.
He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.
I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
Sweetie, are you sure you don't want to come with us to the funeral?
This is pretty cool. You don't see too many spherical cakes.
Sorry.
It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
The Phantom Menace.
Well, that, that clears that up.
That's true.
Yeah.
Oh, my. It's not a contest.
How did that get you into science?
Sheldon, that, that'll take us all night.
The doctor says you need to get exercise.
Good for you.
Go away. Just go away.
But you don't have sex with her, either.
A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.
Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I'd be pretty upset.
So I'm like a bran muffin.
No, it's exactly what you're saying. I'm the boring thing you're choosing because I'm good for you.
Two, and I know what you're thinking, she's eating them.
I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.
I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
No, Mom, it's the same guy I've been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it's complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.
Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.
I have real problems here, Amy. I can't be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.
You're probably right. So, what are you guys doing?
Hey, Sheldon.
Well, I can't take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.
Yeah, she's fed, she took her pills, she's all tucked in and watching TV.
Like us?
You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I'm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.
Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked.
Next Monday.
Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?
How come?
Not tonight. I'm a little frustrated with her.
Did you send everyone to the principal's office already?
I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.
Oh, come on. You might've gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.
That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don't know, do you? What's the matter, smart guy? Don't know Poiseuille's law?
Yes.
What, you? Really?
There isn't any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn't be at the bottom of it.
Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.
Hey, Froot Loops, what's up?
Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.
Okay, him I believe because he's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's tee shirt. But you're just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.
I'll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.
Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.
Yeah, and I'm not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.
Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?
No, no. No need to apologise.
Okay, good night, guys.
Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.
You admit Amy's a distraction?
It wouldn't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that's okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.
Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let's change the world to let's watch TV.
Robot prostitute.
Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.
But they're called Fairly Manilow.
Great.
Go online and look it up.
That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.
But we didn't see them bust one ghost.
Yep. Shake that thing.
Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
Are they making fun of us?
Yeah, that's when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I've got some good news.
Huh. What is this?
You two want to be alone?
No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.
There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.
It's a little more bleak than I thought.
What if we brought them down with us?
I'm not a delivery man, I'm a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.
Ooh, Siam Palace?
Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You're a, you're a lucky man.
Well, it doesn't make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.
Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.
Um, I mean, you're a guy like me, so how'd you get a girl like Penny?
Please, yes.
Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.
Isn't she lucky?
I can't take these.
They'd need the key.
Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.
Yes. I'm very sorry for locking you in my home.
How is this helpful?
No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.
…of AP Calculus.
Great, how?
Okay, just one question. What?
Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.
If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?
Oh, it's a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you're dancing.
Aw, that movie's so cute.
I like Cinderella.
Well, who'd you go with?
I don't. I'm not even sure if that's a person or a typo.
Well, I've been crunching the numbers, and so far, I've gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.
I'm okay.
You're acting odd. Why?
Just go to work, he'll be fine.
He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.
Come on, let's talk about something other than the surgery.
Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you're too beautiful.
I just don't think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…
I did. It's all outdated or disproved.
Look at these notebooks. They're full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.
Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.
I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble's law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.
Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.
Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I'd like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.
Let's celebrate.
Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.
With gift-giving, there's an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn't have one for me, she'll feel terrible.
Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
Correct.
Great. Do it.
Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.
Oh, no, we'll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.
I'm worried about the New Horizons space probe.
Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.
That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It's exhausting.
Do you mean that?
I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I'm aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.
Don't tell Amy that. We'll be here every Sunday.
I don't want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.
According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I'd like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.
It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
You know what? I think it's a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you're jealous of all my relationships.
Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.
Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I'll become more focused.
Yes, we can.
Ladies?  Ladies?  Ladies?
Don't you think you should make him stop all this?
You're still awake?
Come on. Click the mouse with me.
He just left another comment.
Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.
It wasn't that bad.
Read it back one more time.
Please?
So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.
Is the water warm enough?
What's this for?
Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn't you try to help me?
Why don't we leave so you can cool off?
She's been conducting an experiment on apes where they're given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them. That's when Amy said, want to make this interesting?
It's not interesting. It's incredibly insulting.
Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother's house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.
No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart's store, that would be amazing.
Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I'm not an actor.
Sheldon, open the door.
I just saw you.
Open the door now.
Thank you.
All right, fine. I'm him.
Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.
Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you're talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.
Well, that's what the bullies at Bruce Lee's high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.
I really did mean first.
Uh, well, I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.
Ha. Keep dreaming.
I'm putting the city names in the grid now. I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.
All right, we'll wait.
Ma? I'm sorry I didn't take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I'll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We're good to go.
You ready?
Oh, good.
Oh, Bernie, you're gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.  Hey, what's up?
She's gonna know I was looking in it.
Okay, where should I put them?
Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
Howie, what's wrong?
No, no. I'm gonna cheer you up. Here we go.
You know what? I did it. What's four bucks?
Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can.
Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.
This food is amazing.
Oh, that's fine.
Guys.
Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!
I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
It's tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.
Um, uh, uh, uh, we don't have an appointment, and, and we don't belong here, but we, we're, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in.
I don't know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool 'cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don't know much about<i> Doctor Who.
Uh-huh, I'm normally very nice, but you shut up, too.
So, what are you in for?
I don't know the future. Do you think there's a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it?
Aw.
Well, maybe I can do both.
No.
Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.
‘Cause that's all you need, right?
Well, Penny, who's smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?
Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.
I heard you can make good money doing that.
Wish me luck.
Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.
Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
Oh, no.
Short and sexy, that's my wheelhouse.
I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work.
Yeah. You're gonna be on Skype, they're not gonna see your legs.
Oh. Hello. I, I didn't know he was gonna point it at me, so, don't do drugs and stay in school.
Are you ashamed of me?
Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.
You're kidding, right?
Stuart.
Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it's all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.
Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.
Yes, and we'll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.
When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?
You're one to talk. You've been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don't see you showing him the door.
Too slow?
And we've been busy with our paper.
You know which yoghurt I mean.
All right. Tonight's the night.
I don't know. Because we don't have a date?
So you're never getting married? It's his whining, isn't it?
Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.
You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.
No, I think it's because we're eloping.
Yup, just want to get married.
Great. I'll see you two up there.
No, I'll be okay. But I think that I'd like to send the ring back to you.
Yeah.
Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.
Some girl named Mandy.
Mandy Chao?
Hey.
What is happening?
You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I'm smooshing around like pizza dough.
Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?
Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there's a simple solution.
Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn't anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren't above cheating because that's usually how we met.
Uh-huh.
You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I've been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.
She watched it. I'm gonna get that girl back.
Well, Sheldon, there's something about this van that you're going to find very interesting.
Hi.
We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it's only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.
Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.
Well, it's kind of sad that they don't know. I mean, they love Leonard.
When?
You didn't tell me for a year?
Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.
Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard's moving in with Penny. It's difficult not to feel abandoned.
Is that supposed to be a joke?
I can't believe he ran my credit.
I'm sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.
Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.
The past was lunch. You know what's really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.
Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
What's wong, Cooper?
I mean, I can't say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I'm alone, the more desperate I get.
I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you'd like to get a drink after work sometime.
Sowwy, there's a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.
We put Amy on a dating app, and we're seeing what's out there.
Uh, I'm Leonard. This is my friend…
Look, you can trust us. We're respected scientists.
I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
Okay, I'm starting to feel guilty. Aren't we being a little mean?
I'm trying not to attract attention.
Yeah, I hear you. Well, you're good guys, so I'll, uh, I'll take the helium off your hands.
But you ain't getting your money back.
I don't understand.
So, are we allowed to ask how it's going?
Thank you, Barry.
Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.
No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.
I guess we didn't use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn't happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
When we got the security camera.
Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.
So, your father-in-law is in there right now?
Will Wil want it?
Huh.
Don't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
Come on, Amy, show us the dress.
No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
I don't know if I'd say you… oh.
He's cute, right?
That's a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.
I'm trying not to. Do you know him?
Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don't need to tell you, there aren't a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.
But we can't.
And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.
If you can't support me when I'm lying, why are we married?
Fine. You think you know so much. Who's my favourite Spice Girl?
Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?
But you can pal around with a hagfish?
Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
I feel like I know what song that is, but I can't put my finger on it.  My country, 'tis of thee. No.
Problem solved.
Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
When you were married, did your wife cook?
Better. You're the lint trap of my love.
Kiss her, you brilliant fool.
And I will continue to do so!
Wow. You can really arrange that?
No, no, no, no. She'd be going alone. Well, if you think I'm afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.
He's not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?
Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?
We don't want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.
Let's do this.
T minus 15 minutes.
So, um, should I get under the covers with you?
Why are you shaking? Are you cold?
Neither do I. But we can find out together.
It is.
It's not the best Best Western I've been to, but I'd say it's the third best Best Western I've been to.
What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?
Lack of confidence.
What is it, Stuart?
Hmm.
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.
Well, that's it.
It's okay. I know he loves me.
I don't know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.
No. You'd think he would've called once he got settled in.
No, that's not what this feeling is. Is it?
Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.
Yeah, s-so it's, like, Kooper with a K?
When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?
You know, if anything, he's turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.
But it's beautiful.
You know, I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.
Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants, I couldn't if I wanted to.
Not this time.
Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.
Glad I could help.
Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…
Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.
All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth…
Look at him, caring about what's wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.
You went to Emily's to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.
No.
You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.
Good. Then I'll be leaving now.
Come on, you pain in the ass.
Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.
Which is probably why that movie sucks.
Oh. It's so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.
I'm sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.
Wait, are you saying that we didn't have a vibe?
Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.
Bye. All right. So, uh, we're meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody's happy. Easy peasy.
Yes.
No.
What are you gonna say?
What? Why?
He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.
Oh, there's a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.
Midnight. Really? You know what? Let's do it.
It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.
It really can.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
You're right, it is, I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.
All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?
How is that a new invention?
It's true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.
Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
And whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
Nah, she's a good kid.
Well, where's that information been this whole time?
Surprise.
Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?
No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.
How do you know I'm not using the facilities?
I was crushing it, but all right.
You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they're just extremely irritating.
Come on in, fellas.
So, I've reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we've got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.
Wow. It's an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.
Well, to be fair, Howard's idea was based on Sheldon's math.
You've tried to work with him before. It hasn't gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?
Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I'm not even sure what the last one means, but it's another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?
Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she's having a tough time. But it's not like we're getting back together or anything.
Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer? You know that one's out-of-date.
Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It's like a beer commercial.
I'm an astrophysicist. The stars don't take a day off.
Come on. We're a couple of smart guys. I'm sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn't make us look bad.
I don't.
Because I'm a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I've been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I've never even thrown a toothbrush away?
So, these are for you, and if you're not too mad, we'd love to take you guys to dinner.
That's not what the forest smells like.
Come on, Raj, give me a bag.
Nice hat, Sheldon.
Thanks.
All right, if you say so. What's in the box?
No.
They have some board games.
Hey, let's light a fire.
Please, my pleasure.
Okay. Calm down. I'll go first. All right, let's see. Never have I ever…
Okay, I'll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
Yeah.
I can't tell anymore.
Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
Wow.
So does that answer your question?
This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
Man, I'm worn out.
Oh, of course, because I'm the only adult around here.
I don't want to.
Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire's fridge that night. I'm such a dog.
Hey, did I say something to upset you?
She did.
I don't know how you put up with it. He's impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.
From Amy.
I don't think so. Why?
That sounds fun.
I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
What are you doing?
You actually smell the wine?
Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.
Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.
Yeah. Cool.
Oh, she's meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don't ask too many questions about the relationship. We're just keeping it casual.
Hey, Penny, isn't that your old boyfriend Zack?
Oh, yeah.
Would you like a glass of wine?
Why'd you say she's your friend?
Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.
Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer's body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.
Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.
Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I'd like for us to have a good relationship.
People do it all the time.
You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
Very well. What's the last book you read?
That was a joke, dear.
Oh, it's all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It's understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.
I said, Sheldon says he's sorry.
Well, we don't exactly. I'm a microbiologist for the research team.
The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.
I know how you feel. She didn't invite any of us.
Well, then it's settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.
Then I graciously accept.
I was kind of hoping you would.
Okay, Mary.
Oh, Beverly. How nice.
You've met her, right?
Nice to meet you.
And his girlfriend, Amy.
Mom.
You're right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they're using it against us.
Don't laugh, she wasn't joking.
Play with your phone.
Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.
Oh. I, I didn't mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.
I, I think he wants us to pull over.
Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I'm sorry, I got to go now.
Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
I don't see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.
Do you know where I can find him?
Oh, I can't wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.
Here you are, Mother.
Good morning.
Not funny, Wyatt.
Mm-hmm. And he's never been to Texas.
Hello.
Yes, I am. I'm just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I've caused.
Mommy, you want to take this one?
What makes me comfortable is knowing I don't have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.
To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.
I don't believe this.
MIT.
I'm not even sure that's possible.
Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.
Well, my boss said he hadn't decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he's an old rich white guy, and I'm a sweet little pregnant lady who's not afraid to crying front of a jury.
No way.
I am having coffee.
I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother's for Christmas.
I don't think you are.
And a joker.
I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it's fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?
Oh, him. I guess he's all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.
This is my friend, Bernadette. She's pregnant, and she's a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.
Right. Sorry, sir.
And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.
You're darn right, you wouldn't. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.
I'm on it. 15 years from now, we'll make guacamole together.
I don't know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?
That's it. It's Sheldon's bedtime, he is in for the night.
Won't.
Let me know when you start, because that wasn't funny.
He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy's hair on the soap.
Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they're not home.
Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.
Oh, no. I don't want to be an inconvenience. You've got all your lady friends, and…
We're doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.
Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.
Hey.
And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?
Thank you for noticing.
You never leave the house without a paper clip.
It's almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
Why would you tell him that? That's terrible advice.
Oh, uh, they're still working on it.
Leonard?
This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?
Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.
It's all right.
Great, and just so you know, I'm not getting rid of all your stuff.
This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.
Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
Hey, congratulations Bert.
Sounds like the night we had coitus.
I can't believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I'm having a primal urge to throw this rock.
That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls' westwoom.
How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you're brilliant?
What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?
That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.
A foot massage?
Thank you, but I'm not really sure.
Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
But you don't even like flags.
Yeah, I like this one.
You guys relax, I'll get it. Have some bread while it's still warm.
Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.
What a jerk.
All right, I tried.
So, I was reading how it's a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.
That'd be great.
No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he's right behind you. Hello?
Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?
That's true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen who can't produce a single form of ID.
Just because you're starving doesn't make you an artist.
Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
Ah. It sucks that she's not here.
Okay, you don't have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.
Oh, great, now I can say things like I can't believe you're breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I'll still help you move.
Oh, look at all the babies.
Oh. It's Bernadette. She says they're running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.
Well, he didn't throw up on the baby. That's a win.
Well, you're home now.
Do we have to? I really don't want to hear the religious lecture.
I was going chronologically. You're right between Koothrappali's father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.
Hello.
Well, there's really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.  My mother made me take it out.  Amy put alcohol on it.  And here we are.
Really? You're never gonna touch their baby?
Sheldon.
Thank you, Internet. I'm telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.
Hm. At least he took an interest.
This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about it.
Bye.
Sorry, thank you.
Its not that I'd stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.
Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It's easy,
You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.
I get to write a contract? I say, let's get this party of the first part started.
Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn't. Other unacceptable responses include, it's nothing, don't worry about it, and, I said it's nothing don't worry about it.
