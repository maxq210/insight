One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
Thank-you. We'll be right back.
No, that was the result of my work with lasers.
Hi.
Hi.
Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.
If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.
Just sit somewhere else.
That's not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbour.
That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.
To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone.
Oh, my God, what happened?
Oh, hi Penny.
Sounds like you have company.
Yeah, no problem.
I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
I hardly think so.
That's ridiculous.
Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.
Considering what? How great this place looks?
We could put her stereo back there.
Hey guys, I got this.
Thank you, I've got to talk to that mailman.
Okay, well, thank you, again.
What's the matter.
Well, I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.
There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I'm… a bit of a self-taught expert.
Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.
Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.
It's a bio-feedback technique, it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.
Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.
Are you okay?
Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?
As do I.
I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.
Look, you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.
Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.
Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.
Leonard called me.
Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.
Because you're going to go down to your office, you're going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back.
Just so we're clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.
No kidding?
Good.
There are no incorrect equations on my board.
Who wouldn't?
Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Fine.
TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…
I'll get it.
Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!
If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.
Yes. But I need a wing-man.
And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.
If he understands that, you're in trouble.
Leonard, are you okay.
If we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time.
Hey Penny, come on in.
And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it's 8:13 and we're still not playing Halo.
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.
I'll risk it.
Thanks.
Hi, Christie.
Oh, terrific, now we're running a cute little B&B.
I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.
No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree.
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
Hi!
You're 26 years old Rajesh. We want grandchildren.
Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can't go through…
Understandable, but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.
So Leonard, how about it?
Then swim to Cuba.
I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.
You have a drink that'll make him less obnoxious?
What happened?
What?
Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great, she isn't fat any more!
The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.
Really, so do I.
No, I'm Leonard.
But he's right, Papa, listen to him.  You! You are the one who ruined everything!
But Papa, please….
Okay, well, good night.
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this  lamp.
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
They don't, that's why I saved this one.
Oh, why didn't you wear it at Halloween?
Okay, well, I guess we're back to the corduroy suit.
It's certainly preferable to my plan.
Okay, that is it.
Well that's not much of an apology, but I'll take it.
Why?
To help you.
I don't get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?
Sounds fun.
There have been studies.
Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?
From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
I don't think so.
I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.
It's right here on the bottom.
Leonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.
Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.
No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.
Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
I don't know.
Howard' Who's on the phone.
Howard' Were you playing with him?
He's paranoid, and he's established a nest.
Good. Good.
What does that mean?
Advantage Kim.
I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.
Dennis, we discussed this, we're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we've agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.
Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me.
It's a small brown paper bag, Ma, I'm looking at it right now.  Why would I make that up, there's no ding-dong in it.  How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?
I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.
Then our problem would be solved.
What?
Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.
Or can we?
Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.
What did you spill on it?
maybe we should take a little break.
You know who's apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV's Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.
We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning.
Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.
It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.
You're joking, right?
Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…
Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.
My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.
Don't think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.
They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.
Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
Okay. I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
Go on.
Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.
Thanks. See you.
Yeah, I'll just tell her you said hey.
Goodbye Shelly.
What about the cream cheese frosting.
You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.
Well why not?
I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.
Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don't drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.
Hey.
Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade. (Raj enters carrying party supplies. Howard waves him away while in the background Leonard is heard saying “oh, that did not feel good.”) Come on, come on, oh you clever little…. Come on, come on, take that!
Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we're getting, see, happy guy available.
Bad, very bad.
Leonard's fine. I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way.
Look, sir we are very busy here and I just don't…  holy crap!
Not surprising. Penny's emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk.
What, so you're saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you'll just walk away?
Doesn't that violate the health code?
Yes. You're right. I should just say I'm done with him.
Yes, you should, go ahead, say it.
I like tangerine chicken, I'm not getting tangerine chicken.
Yeah, I know, I know that part.
Ach, why not? We're already through the looking glass anyway.
Alright, yeah, I don't really know who they are…
I made an eight o'clock reservation.
Oh, right, no, I'm lactose intolerant.
Let's go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.
He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
Well I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity? Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
Well I'm sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.
And some of those skinless chicks were hot.
No.
Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
Actually, I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.
I've never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.
Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.
You promised Penny what?
So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?
Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?
Why, what's so unusual about me having a date?
Penny.
Alright, let's say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone's not touching my food?
Okay, let me put it this way, if you're really Leonard's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
Oh, it isn't, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?
Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.
I did, and he said he'll get here when he gets here.
Sheldor?
The Conqueror.
Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!
Okay, look, I bought the game, and I've been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.
You're in my bedroom.
Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.
I don't work on Mondays.
She comes into my room. No-one's supposed to be in my room.
Everything has to do with sex.
Uh… (checks out Sheldon's package) Yeah, yeah. (Pulls out pen and writes it on Sheldon's hand.)
Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.
Well, we're going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.
You were a colossal ass-hat.
We're here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.
It's very nice of you, I would like that.
Sheldon?
That's what you're wearing.
Hey, good news, you don't have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.
Yes.
Brown rice, not white?
Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a good lion semen story, what's your point.
Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way, but, you're insane.
So, she's not Indian, the boy's just sowing some wild oats.
What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
What's wrong with him?
And?
Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.
And Radio Shack.
Fine.
I was otherwise engaged.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Ramona. Come on in.
To watch, right?
Hey, do you want to hang out with us?
Seriously? You're not coming?
Please, please, I don't have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.
So we can communicate through the wall.
Oh, hey, hi.
More Pad Thai, please.
They all live in a house together.
Wait a minute, you're telling me that I'm within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?
Why?
Yes.
Put it on the agenda.
Penny! Penny did it.
You have two strikes. Three strikes and you're out. It's a sports metaphor.
Yes, baseball.
Leonard, she's in my spot.
Party with the pretty girls, dude!
Oh, I didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
I reiterate, knuckle under.
Oh! Hello.
A-a-a-aw!
Telephone wires can't electrocute you, can they?
Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that's, that's not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
I saw what you did there.
Oh, okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.
I'm sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?
I really like that you're such a loyal friend.
Then how can I say it convincingly?
Time shift
You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
Well, that depends.
How do we decide that?
Hmm. Lisa's gonna be disappointed.
Really? That's where I was born!
To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.
We're going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn't have done a better job.
You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
What?
I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.
Oh, for god's sakes.
Leonard, congratulations.
Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.
No, you're not.
Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
So, go hit on her.
You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
Hiney?
Booya.
It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you've done since you've been here completely useless.
Did not.
Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You've never seen a hypocrite before?
Now, honey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.
I know. It's funny when it's not happening to us.
No problem.
Come on, bath stuff, it's perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.
This one. Let's go.
Yeah, why not? You can't do any worse than Leonard.
Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.
All right, enough chitchat, let's destroy something.
What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.
How is it supposed to be a dance if I'm the only girl?
Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You'd be the only doable girl.
Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you're the one who's peculiar.
Um, so what are you saying?
Wow.
Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?
What do you mean?
He's depressed because he's pathetic and creepy and he can't get girls.
I need you to apologize to How…
Hey, I'm a big boy. I'm not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.
We don't have that option, we've accepted the challenge. We can't run away from a fight.
Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke's robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.
Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?
Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
Yes, well it's better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.
Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.
Oh…
He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.
Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?
Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
We could eat after the movie.
Bye, Sheldon.
Hang on a moment.  Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
Are they working on that?
Do I have to?
Of course. That's how you move a conversation forward.
Hey, Penny. How was work?
Was that sarca..
Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn't you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills.
What?
We're on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
Who's with me?
Nope. I just think he's really changed. We're having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.
You must be Leonard's mother.
I didn't bring it up. You did.
Nor I.
Are you done?
What about it, Howard?
What difference does it make?
I'll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.
Well, then why are you doing it?
Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we're taking the train.
Holy crap! Look!
That's it.
You know, I've already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can't score with. I think I'll let you two take this one.
That's cute.
Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.
of access. Good grief. What? No, don't put me on hold. Oh!
And did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?
Okay, now you're going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I'm nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck's mouth.
What's her name?
Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.
Yes.
And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
Sarcasm. Good-bye.
Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.
Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.
Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?
Raj, help me out here.
Hey, Penny, it's Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.
Sounds like a sweet deal.
Great.
Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?
Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
This is Thai food.
Fascinating.
I think we're fine, Stuart.
Excuse me.
Depends. Do you like it?
Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny's business over there?
All right. Then is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
Sure, why not?
Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.
It's way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.
I found the decaf!
Nah, they're eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.
So, I win.
Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
God, I hope not. And no, I'm not Princess Leia.
C3PO.
No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who's turn is it?
Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.
That's not an email, that's Leslie's facebook page.
Hello Rajesh Ram… Hi, Rajesh, I'm Michaela.
Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren't Ramayan.
What? No. ..
I don't know, Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy.
Don't worry, I can take good care of your friend.
Okay, that's question 20, you have to guess.
Oh, God, I don't know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?
I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!
Only if it doesn't rhyme.
You already gave her the money?
I'm homesick.
You're paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
I'm listening.
Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…
It must be hell inside your head.
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you've fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here's a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.
Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.
Yes.
Actually, it would help.
All right, I'll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.
Hang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
Sheldon, you know I can't eat butter. I'm lactose intolerant.
Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.
I say double feature.
What are we having?
Reconstituted Thai food.
If there's going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don't care for luau, toga or under the sea.
He's speaking about it.
I couldn't even think of anyone else while you were gone.
Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
Hello, Penny. I realize you're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?
Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don't expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.
Why did you have to make him happy?
Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.
Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
Sheldon, over here.
Oh, Leonard, you shouldn't have. Oh, boy! What is it?
It's actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on…
Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He's your best friend.
Grateful.
I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
Uh-huh.
Hey, guys.
Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
Oh, yeah.
So much.
Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don't buy. Bet me.
Let's open her up.
Who wants to know?
No, you don't understand. We just want to ask you a question.
Yes!
Young man, I've been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.
Let me show you something. See that? That's a Crawley's dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that's a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can't. That tramp took me for everything!
Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
Interesting.
Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.
Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?
This.
Well, I'm going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.
Mmm, these are so good
Unbelievable.
So, what's going on with Raj?
Yeah.
Gentlemen.
Okay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way, but I'd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
Am I interrupting?
Yeah, maybe.
I'm the boss. I make the jokes.
What are you doing here?
By the way, I couldn't help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.
Oh. I get it, I'm the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I'll get out of your way. Uh, you're gonna want to eat those eggs while they're still hot.
English is your native language.
It means doo-doo.
I'm busy.
I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
Excuse me. Oh, damn. It's my mother.
That's nothing. I couldn't ride a bicycle 'cause my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.
Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.
Fire demon.
Kites ho!
That chick, she smiled at me.
If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses. My point is, if we're going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.
It's not a little scooter. It's the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?
So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?
I don't want to fly kites, Sheldon. We're watching football here.
Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.
I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we'll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.
Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.
Leonard is wrong.
Leonard!
Big deal. Every time I watch that show it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
The ducks in my tub.
One was already in an accident.
All right.
I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.
Quick, get forks.
…And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized… duh-duh-duh! …she was his cousin.
I'm not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.
You laughed.
I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
Leonard.
Sure. The more, the merrier.
Shoes for Less.
‘Cause I want to surprise him.
Yeah, no, I got it.
Do they have that?
Thanks, honey.  All right, what is your deal?
I hope not, because you don't want to mess with me. I'm crazy.
Howard?
No, no, don't move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?
Howard' Oh, I can't say no to my little tushy face. I'll be back soon.
Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?
What did I do now?
Same thing you're doing here. I came to see Leonard's experiment.
Really? Why not?
Um…
August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
Once again, I'm driving. I'm right here.
Oh, yes. I just discovered I don't have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
Well, the fact is, you can't.
I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.
How is that going to help them?
Hey, there's no reason for you to be scared.
Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?
He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.
Great, you do that.
Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That's part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.
Maybe you need a fresh start.
Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?
Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
Don't tell Koothrappali. After you.
I'm going to count to three. One…
Oh, hey, it's no big deal. My sister's got a kid who's special.
No, no, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.
Leonard doesn't snore.
I didn't really have to. So, how about construction?
No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.
Yes.
How long can he keep this up?
one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let's see, who's left? Oh, that's right. My plans. Isn't anyone going to ask?
Actually, Professor Norton can't make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.
That's the one.
Come on, Sheldon. Can't you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
What's going on?
Very well. Enjoy yourself. You're going to be in the presence of something that I've dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
Just think, this time tomorrow we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine's Day.
Chicken?
Can't believe it. We're going to meet Stan Lee! (Presses play on his iPod. His shirt starts to play “I'm So Excited” by the Pointer Sisters. He dances.)
He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
Of course I do. You're an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
No, I'm following the law. I'm ignoring you.
That's the toilet?
You know very well how it went.
Sure, yeah, name it.
Yeah?
Here's Spock's head with no body. Here's Mr. T's body with no head. Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body with Mr. T's head. I pity the fool who's illogical.
It's not Elvish. It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
Just a guy. I know a guy.
Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don't you go after Raj's mother?
That's not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
Stop it!
It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you're saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.
No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.
I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
Why don't we just talk?
So, I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.
For what?
Uh-uh, give it a minute.
Oh. Oh. Thank you.
What? No.
Oh, thanks.
Penny,  Penny,  Penny.
Ice cream?
If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.
Excuse me. I don't know who you're chanting for as I am currently the ball.
It's always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you're not ready for it.
I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.
Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention.
For an hour and a half?
All right. But let me know if you're going to stuff him with junk food. I don't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn't that be wrong?
Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
You, too.
What chapter are you on?
Morning.
Morning, Sheldon.
More than pleasant.
Good.
Hang on.
What?
That's why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom's chicken soup.
Is she suggesting what I think she's suggesting?
You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. ( The lobby) I'd just started at the university.
No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.
Telling you? Telling you.
A car, yeah.
Uh, I'm gonna go with preserving the knowledge.
Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series Firefly.
Oh, my God.
Hmm, I'm still not comfortable. Of course. There's too many people here.
Well, I've adjusted the formula.
Man in Penny' That makes no sense.
Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'.
Oh! That's very cool.
See, now this is a man for Penny.
No, it's not.
Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?
Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.
Uh, I know! It's been a while!
Not us. Him.
Sheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.
Oh. Hey, Leonard.
I don't object to the concept of a deity, but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
I wouldn't say amazing. At best, it's a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.
She's not my girlfriend.
I can't date Amy.
Yeah, it's okay.
Well, why don't you tell her?
Yes.
Really? A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk, dude. That's funny, ask anyone.
No, no! Don't touch, the program is paused.
I'm sorry. 16?
I only built the arm.
The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die.
By this much.
Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
There's no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.
Sure.
I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
Of course you must.
Sheldon- Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.
Sheldon- Sing me Soft Kitty.
What?
Is he always like this when he loses?
What?
It's how they lure you in. I believe it's called bait and switch.
Suffered in silence?
So this is the plan? From now on, we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?
The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills.
That's the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!
He got a cat to keep him company.
Okay, I get it. We're worried about Sheldon.
Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.
25 cats!
You're wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.
Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?
You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.
I did a stupid thing.
Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.
Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.
Yeah, I said I'd think about it.
Can you say it again for me?
Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
Maybe later.
Oh. I'm sorry.
How'd he know about it?
Mm-mmm. Too soon.
I read.
Dude, why don't you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?
Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?
That was rude.
Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.
You can't say that anymore.
Screwed.
The volcano thing? No.
Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.
Who is it?
Why would I touch her, she's covered with airplane germs.
Uh, my plans with Priya.
Not particularly.
You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It's locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.
You've really got to get out more.
And Raj.
What were you doing with Priya?
Apparently, the background interviews didn't go well. You guys wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Who knows? I haven't watched any scary movies recently. I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.
High five. Not too hard. Thank you.
Who's there?
I informed you thusly.
You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us–
Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.
And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.
I guess that's that. Let's go home.
Indy's young sidekick from Temple of Doom.
And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.”
Where did he go?  We're looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.
Let's see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.
Yeah.
You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?
Aw.
I'm just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.
Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?
Miss.
What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
Well, he was Italian. It's a reasonable assumption.
Hold on. Wait. No, it's okay, go ahead.
Penny' My pleasure. It's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny's that knows how to use a napkin.
Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.
Love you, too.
Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can't go any further. There's a sacred cow in my way.
And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.
You got to admit, I am, I'm delightful.
You know it's been more than a year since I've even kissed a girl?
Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don't care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.
Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.
Did you know that the iconic Valentine's heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?
Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.
All right, I will.
And?
It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.
Do you understand why people don't want to play with you?
No, although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool.
Oh, thanks.
So, you and Zack again, huh?
So go apologize.
Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you're ditching me to go look at comic books?
Hey, babe.
Okay, what about your friend Amy?
Look up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. I forget the rest.
Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny.
Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…
Satisfied?
Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.
Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…
We're not wasting time with names right now.
Playing it. I've loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it's been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.
So, your project is more important than mine?
I'm practicing my theremin.
That's what it says on the packet.
Say you're sorry.
Hey. So you guys ready to order?
The what?
So, Amy, I've been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?
I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.
Really? And miss the keynote?
No. Amy?
I can't believe you let him kick me out of the car.
Oh, my God, Glenn!
I'm too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
So, girl talk?
I guess not.
I suppose that's one way to look at it.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one's career had reached the end of the road.
Well, I thought we'd start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.
Now just read your mother's line.
You're kidding.
No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.
I think we were misled about the cute girls.
Right. Fascinate me.
Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!
Well, of course. There's no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.
No, I didn't do it for the money.
Uh, I'm gonna go lie down.
I didn't do it for the money!
I need a place to crash.
Did you offer him a hot beverage?
Hold on. When did Priya get here?
Don't worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.
Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don't get to tell me who I can and can't have a relationship with.
Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?
No.
All right, Howard, let's get something straight right now. I'm not going to be your mother.
Actually, it's the three of us.
Great.
Not really.
How come it's not a party when we do it here?
Ugh!
Hey, you're just in time. We made Tex-Mex.
Hi, bestie.
Yeah?
You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.
Sheldon, do you want some or not?
Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?
Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.
This deck is rigged in some fashion.
So you're saying this is a regulation deck?
Um…
Yeah. The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
Whatcha doin'?
Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn't look like a mannequin in the boys' department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?
No.
You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.
You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.
Yes, he does live with his parents. Here's a Google Earth shot of their house.
Oh, geez, I don't know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.
That's the nicest thing he does to your sister.
No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart than a Klingon bat'leth.
Lucky bastard.
No rush, no rush.
Oh, great. It's my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what'd you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat's fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It's one of the reasons I love her.
Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India's a goofy place.
And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
Sure.
You're pregnant?
That's interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?
A girls night? Oh, I don't know if I'm up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.
Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.
Morning, Sheldon.
Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
None?
Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.
Oh, cool. Can I play?
A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing. He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
Fine.
In the bathroom.
What, are they getting engaged?
Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
Oh, please, you're not that kind of person.
What?
Oh, yeah, she's got puddles in all the right places.
Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that's what a person orders in a Jewish deli.
She's a lovely girl. Cute as a button.
That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.
What's the difference?
So it's probably genetic.
What?
That's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.
One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
Oh!
I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.
Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.
Oh, you heard?
Oh, my God, she's that Mona? Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?
Yes, it's “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
Leonard, sweetheart, we're kissing, not eating hot soup.
I'll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.
Rajesh has many friends?
Hey.
Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.
Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can't see you.
No, it's not Amy.
He's been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.
Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.
Okay, just the candle thing.
Hey, honey.
If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.
Sheldon, take it easy.
Yep, here we are.
Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.
That's pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother's house.
Don't listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally wear corsages to a wedding. That's more of a prom thing.
Why shouldn't they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we'd stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.
Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.
Ready for bed?
Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny's door)
It's me.
I don't know if I want to play anymore.
Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other's bikini regions.
Do you really want that?
Oh, fine. Let's agree she kissed both of us.
Because it's working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I've co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I'm close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.
Well, I choose love.
Fair enough. It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.
Only 8,000? We're wasting precious time. Buy it.
Hello, Wil Wheaton.
Got it. Can I have my water?
Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.
I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.
Just stop talking, Howard.
Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We're supposed to be partners. We're supposed to be a team.
Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.
I love you.
I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't want to break up over this.
It's not for us to judge. We're just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you've done.
If you're gonna love me, you're gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.
It's my last one. I want you to have it.
Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?
How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation?
Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.
Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'. What do we do when someone's hurtin'?
These are delicious.
Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.
I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me.
All right, Mom. When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son, believe it, because it's true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard's hand)
Or maybe I'm part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I'm still basically a toddler.
That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?
Let's go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
No. We just made out a little.
No. I'm having a moral crisis.
On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?
You are. I'm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we've only got one shot.
The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you're going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who's been biting you all week.
I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it's just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.
Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Bye.
Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.
It's okay. I'm glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
Really? Amy?
Oh, look. It's Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.
When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.
What do you think?
Oh, Leonard.
No, I was talking to the bird.
Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.
The bird's still there?
Please, that's a seagull. If you're not going to help, don't help.
Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.
I'm going to get some fries. You want anything?
No problem.
No, Bernadette, don't be a hero!
Yeah.
Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?
Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka'a expansion pack is out.
Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?
I'm the guy.
Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you're my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.
No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.
Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?
How exactly would these glasses work?
14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.
Oh, my God, that's perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don't wear, and they're just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.
You got one for good luck.  I'll get it.
You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.
The Dark Knight has your back. He's scared, but he has your back.
A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You've chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
Glad I could help.
Okay, we're going to roll up this newspaper.
Yeah, so?
What are you gonna do?
We both know that's your koala face.
Absolutely not. Look, we're just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.
No.
It's called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.
Yeah, that sounds right.
Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?
Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don't help them set up their printer.
How about now?
Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
What?
Here's two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
Yeah, it's all good. We-We'll always have feelings for each other.
Well, it's a little late for me to start saying no, isn't it?
That was a really nice dinner. I'm glad you asked me out again.
Me, too, I missed you.
Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.
What am I doing? I'm talking with you.
Thank you, it's nice to be appreciated.
Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.
All right. That's it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.
Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?
Since when don't you knock? It's like the only good thing about you.
Of course you do. It's about you, like everything else.  Oh, thank goodness. I don't think I had it in me to make another glass of water.
Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?
Positive.
What are you doing hiding back there?
If I ever actually ever get married.
Yeah. Howie's gonna freak out.
Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.
Hey! He did that on purpose,
What do you propose?
Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.
Oh, Amy, please.
Hello. I'm here for my haircut with Mr. D'Onofrio.
Nope.
You're so brave. I'm proud of you.
I was sleeping.
Penny, you're not trained. You're not licensed. Most importantly, you don't have access to my haircut records.
Turn off our phones so our moms can't call.
I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it. That's all I got.
Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn't as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn't make the land speeder go.
Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
Wow. Yeah, b-beginner's luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I'm gonna drink this entire cup and then I'm going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?
What?
I can't help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
Before; now it's you.
Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.
Well, if you're not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?
Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
And this is Howard.
Yes, and to open it would destroy it's value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.
You're the one who told me to play with it.
Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
Well I told you, you don't, it's mint in box.
I can't because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that's a lie.
Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.
But I said I'm sorry.
Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
Raj, you're our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?
Great, thank you. Oh, that's terrific.
Hey.
We're gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.
Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.
Oh, for heaven's sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.
Fine. You have very tiny hands.
Right. To Howard.
I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I'm not sure I even know who the man is any more.
Why didn't you tell me
Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I'll tell you later.
I'm gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.
Ah, much better.
Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.
Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.
No, no, you got to go. You can't turn down an opportunity like this.
Penny, just, wait. I've been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.
Yeah.
Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.
I mean, we know it's short notice, but we'd love you all to come with us.
Well, it was going to be mine.
That's what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
Folks, can I have your attention. It's five o'clock, we're going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.
Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.
Your new mother-in-law's a piece of work.
Here you go? What am I, a football?
No.
Well, he started it.
I can't believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.
Tell him yourself.
Oh, so now you're an astronaut and a doctor?
Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.
I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can't let a woman tell you what to do.
That's enough.
Hey, Stuart.
So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?
Sheldon, you are not in charge.
Yuh-uh, one more question, if you're going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.
Yeah, of course you do. You're a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.
Penny said she's not sure she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.
Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I'm going to pause to let that sink in.
What?
Okay, you listen to me. I think it's really sweet you're trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?
Of course not.
Please don't hurt my friend.
I don't know. Say, being mean is lame, what's cool is being nice.
I know.
Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn't start typing until I was six.
Sorry!
It's not flattery if it's the truth.
She seems nice.
You're going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
This should be fun.
You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank's your problem, not mine.
How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?
Welcome aboard, old chum.
Gesundheit. You okay?
You're unbelievable.
Got it.
Uh, gift? Uh, Present!
It's an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
Ah, he's spoiling me and I love it.
Oh, well.
I'm, I'm sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard's foreskin?
Letting him make me happy.
He's an experimental physicist.
Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.
Wow. High-techie-techie. What's this little box?
What do you mean?  Oh! Wow!
I once looked in Sheldon's underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
Okay, listen, there's something I need to tell you. I've been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.
It's really good. We've been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.
No, Leonard, this is my thing.
So, now all you have to do is let him win.
So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.
And cut. You realize that I'm doing this for free, right?
Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.
Don't take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
Howard, I'm doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?
Yeah. I can't believe I'm not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
Well, it's been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don't think that's going to cut it.
You might want to pace yourself.
I know. It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her.
She's lucky you were there.
It's sad that you know that.
Where are you going?
I think it's an old storage room.
Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks. I'm, I'm way above average in a lot of other things.
You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
I'll be right back.
Your picture's on my refrigerator.
Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.
Yeah, really sorry.
Yeah.
Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I'm sure they'll give you another parking space.
I don't have any.
Hi Sheldon.
Howard, what are you doing?
Well, that doesn't make sense, either.
Your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  Stop that.
Well, not with that attitude.
Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
What thing?
I've never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.
Fine. There.
Here we go. Oh!
Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.
Pirate with a peg leg?
So, what's the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?
Somebody sing the damn song.
No, not really.
I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.
Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I'm holding hands with another person.
But you're not alone anymore. Now you've got Sheldon.
What recordings?
To my bones. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.
I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I've reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies.
Oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all. No, he's loving it. Yeah, he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six.
Oh, damn it, you are.
I don't care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?
What did you do?
Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.
It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.
To show people when they don't believe me.
When did Howard learn to sew?
Look, Leonard, there's a bridge. Drive off it.
Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.
Well then, what do you recommend?
Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?
Good idea. I'll help you.
It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.
Sheldon, your food's getting cold.
Because I'm not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.
You! Always bet on black.
What do we have to lose?
Ooh, I, I think it's done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.
Oh, Howie, I love these.
You ever going to sleep with Amy?
Oh, my God!
How could you not notice?
Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You're only proving my point, little lady.
Wow. It sounds to me like you don't want us to live together.
Oh, please. You're a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.
If you don't leave now, she'll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.
Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?
Beep.
Thank you.
No problem. We just sat down.
Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he'll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.
You know what? Why don't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine's Day?
Really?
We're glad you could make it.
Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?
It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.
Why would I do that?
Hey, I don't want you to go any more.
You should go 'cause you want to go, not because you have to.
He's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.
You're, you're a good friend for trying to help, but, I've made my choice.
Why?
Well, is that all of it? (Pulls a Rubik's cube from his pants.) Just set it down.
Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.
I lied. I love them. I only said that so you'd go out with me.
Sheldon, you're always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
It's more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
Nothing.
What did you tell your boss?
No, you can't join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
I don't know. You ever look at porn Web sites?
Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let's get out of here.
I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?
Later.
Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…
Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…
What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you've been gone a long time.
Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
Shame on all of you.
You know, too.
Use me as a human shield!
Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.
That's more like it.
Do they know they don't stand a chance 'cause you're so great?
Yeah. Just thought I'd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I'd rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee's going to be there.
Ooh, meerkat fight!
Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.
She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he's Indian? And he's an astrophysicist, too?
Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.
With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca's. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It's got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?
Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it's me, and I don't want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y'all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?
And?
Okay, good night.
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?
And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.
That doesn't answer my question.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
What, well what's wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I'm, I'm an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I'm a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.
Uh-oh.
No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.
Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
Ready whenever you guys are.
See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.
Oh, it's okay. I've been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.
So, what do you say?
Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.
You were pushing me. I clearly didn't want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.
The dragon's Christopher Walken. That's perfect.
Oh.
And now?
Okay.
I erotically caress your  nose.
I have a job.
He knows, wow.
Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.
Yeah.
I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.
Thank you, Sheldon. That must've been very hard for you to say.
Oh, no.
Be cool.
No, it's a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!
Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I'm gonna be huggin' the toilet tonight.
Sure.
Is that right?
How about we just talk?
All right. In 4D chess…
Oh, God.
Keep your voice down.
Well, I've been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.
Ah.
Oh.
What's odd is they're in the trash can.
I made some brownies. You want one?
Why can't she do it?
Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?
Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
Who knows? Uh, you said you'd be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you're taking me to work, but for all I know, I'll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.
Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.
Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy's girlfriend is my enemy.
Leonard! Hi!
Oh. Okay. Well, here's, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won't call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.
What, now, do you have company?
Howie, the oestrogen's getting absorbed by your skin. That's why you've been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.
Well, it's kind of hard to tell.
Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.  Ooh, brie's ready.
I'd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
I don't know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can't be good.
Stop it.
Maybe we can do it next week.
Thank you.
Find something you like.
Oh, congratulations. You're the first team to arrive.
Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
Oh, oh, that's good. Then this would be
To the planetarium.
It's just a bunch of pants.
Oh.
Then where's the coin?
Run.
She got the way to groove me. She got the way to move me.
Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.
Well, you're, you're right. Let's just go.
I'm sharing my pain.
And I'm not buying it. Try again.
Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.
This is the worst. If we're gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.
Wait, wait, if it wasn't for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse.
It's actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon's looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.
Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That's why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.
No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there'd be too much of me for you, not the other way around.
What exactly do you think you'd get sick of?
Oh, please, I'm your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That's right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.
Image number six, woman giving birth.
You're not listening to my side of it.
You want a TUMS?
Yeah, well, I didn't handle it so great, either.
Well, we're real close to finishing off the new Batman game.
Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?
No, no, what are you doing? He's both happy and quiet. It's like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.
Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?
Okay, good, 'cause I've been really struggling with this.
And that's why you're not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who's getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I'll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.
Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn't count.
What?
What?
Bernie's having a girls' night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?
Come on, he's a retired kids show host.
That's even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?
Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I'm making.
All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.
Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.
It's because I'm annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I'm annoying.
Wow, you ask really hard questions.
Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he's not doing it on purpose. It's just how he is. But he's also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.
He's kidding. If that were true, it'd be so much bigger.
Since when can't you open up with me?
Oh. Uh, great.
Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?
Oh, I'm just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon's stupid face when he sees that I didn't let this get to me.
Sweetie, every night you don't kill him in his sleep, he wins.
Well, I don't.
No traffic, we're sailing.
Hey, guys, I'm trying to cook in here.
Ooh!
1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
To your dad.
Broad shoulders, good hair.
Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
Stir the gravy.
Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we'll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.
Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.
Did somebody say pie?
She's so tiny. It's funny when she's mad.
Sheldon.
Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it's ten. I'll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.
Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.
Um, is this getting weird?
It's not a big deal.
He asked me.
Actually, I didn't invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.
Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.
You didn't ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.
Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.
Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.
End fantasy sequence.
Fantasy sequence in Amy's apartment.
He made you his screensaver.
Did you miss me?
I would've preferred to have you there with me.
You guys need anything else?
You know, I think we're zeroing in on your problem.
You mean like fatties and uggos?
No, Dad, I don't think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don't need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon's ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.
I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.
I don't.
All right, baby, here's the deal.
And you didn't get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn't get your part cut!
How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.
You need to let it go, Sheldon.
But I don't want a vacation.
Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.
Well, he's always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.
Anybody home?
Hi, Amy. I, oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you had any company.
Hello.
Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
I don't know. She already thinks I don't support this, so if I call, it might look like I'm checking up on her.
Yeah. I'm just returning my uniform.
Why do you ask?
Weren't you?
Sorry. You want the book or not?
Fine. I'm not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn't you ask me before you did it?
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, Sunday's the worst. Everybody's leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.
What? You were all going as the Hulk?
Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.
Yes. He, he's late because he's on his way here from 1940.
It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.
I could go for a drink.
Hold on. We always do this.
Even Batman breaks the rules.
No need. I'm breaking rules all the time.
Name one.
That's right.
Oh, come on, it wasn't me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.
No, I think we're just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.
It's a little late, but I'll take it.
How much chocolate did she eat?
A whole box.
Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she's scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don't do Firework, that gets her all riled up.
I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?
I don't know what made me think tonight would be any different.
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.
Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
Moo-stache.
Here, you can have your seat.
Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.
Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.
Thank you.
Mm, Sheldon, you didn't have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.
Since when am I the buzzkill?
Hey, Bernie. I'm home. Hello.
What do you want me to do? You're perfectly healthy.
Go, go, go.
Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
I have an eidetic memory. I don't know what his problem is.
I didn't do anything. I was just sitting here.
No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
Amy, I could use some help.
Are we playing individual or teams?
Plane tickets? Yeah.
I find a girl I like, and you're stealing her?
When? How about in the car? I'm an astronaut, and you know it. You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.
No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I'm not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it's making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn't your car.
Well, it's too late.
Does a brisket count? I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough. But didn't she know we were coming?
So I guess you two are making it work long distance.
What does your card say, Bernadette?
But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.
Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn't need the money.
That's not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I'm sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.
How long have you been involved with him?
That is no way to speak to your mother.
I think you and Leonard will be together.
That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn't go smoothly with your mom.
What did you do?
Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?
I am.
Putting it in my phone right now.
If only there were a solution to that.
I'm gonna go with monster. What do you got?
“LOL.” Smiley face.
What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?
You look, you look really pretty tonight.
I'm still here.
You'll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.
Yes, but you wouldn't understand.
Sorry I'm late. What did you do?
Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I'm glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.
Ah, it's all right. They could've filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.
But I realize they're gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it's important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.
Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?
No problem. How's your mom feeling?
It's fusion.
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they're friends. I just wish he'd be that comfortable around me already.
Oh, for God's sake. Look, he's a physicist who's trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.
He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.
Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.
Okay.
And if you're not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
Sweetie, are you sure you don't want to come with us to the funeral?
Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I'm sure he didn't care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he'd say enjoy Star Wars Day.
I know.
Sorry.
Wow.
But after the cantina scene.
No, I meant that as a regret.
Yeah, I think I would.
Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.
Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.
Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.
What do you mean, not really?
No, I do. You're upset about Emily and you're Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
Well, now do you see the problem?
Queen? I've been killing myself here.
Howard.
Just so you know, I'm not seeing anyone else.
Yeah.
You, you stupid Pop-Tart.
Oh. Then I guess I'm in.
Where's my pancakes?!
It's an outrage. Honestly, I'm tempted to leave the university.
You know what? It's probably fine.
Shut up.
Well, then, I'm all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?
You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you're always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you're not there.
You're probably right. So, what are you guys doing?
Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.
You do that?
He'll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.
I don't have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.
Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.
This is stupid. I'm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.
I know, but she's kind of a bully.
Your mother and I? You're not my father.
That's a good point. You know, I'm a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, 'cause I wasn't in direct sunlight for six weeks.
So, Penny, when's the new job start?
I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her.
I do, I see it.
Did you send everyone to the principal's office already?
No one signed up.
I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.
Want to stop here?
Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?
Well, not just him. May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.
I then suggested a pub.
May I have one of your fries?
That was a close one.
Is it too late for him to cancel?
Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?
My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.
Yeah.
Yes, I am. You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?
And I'm sure you can turn it around.
Because if she hadn't, she'd still be wading through the list.
What's up?
Mm, just try and call first.
Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
Well, don't feel bad. I think we've all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.
Oh. Okay.
It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.
This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.
Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
What?
Hey, Penny, hey, let's go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.
The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.
Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?
Exactly.
Yeah, I'm sorry, too. We're about to share the rest of our lives together. It's our money, who cares who has it?
Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.
Good. Little claustrophobic.
Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.
That's preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
What?
You tell me. I feel like I can't breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.
The space probe.
No, it's not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.
Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.
What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
What happened?
Anytime. Uh, I've got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.
Can we talk in private?
I can't do it, he's my best client.
Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?
Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.
Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.
Oh, great. I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.
Ugh, thanks a lot.
You're kidding.
I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.
What makes you think I didn't go to my prom? I went.
What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
Yeah.
It's not you. Now think, there's a car named after him.
Hi.
Yes, for the first five or six years, but I've gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine.
Let's see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.
Well, I've been doing some research and I've learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.
I think she meant something a little happier.
Oh, this isn't for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.
So there are things you don't like.
Who were you in couples therapy with?
Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn't get recorded.
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
Highlight 4
Mmm. It's just columns of random numbers. Toss it.
This has to mean something.
We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
Any chance you know what it is?
No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.
No, she's right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I'm gonna be much more sensitive. I don't want anyone walking on eggshells around me.
Yeah.
I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.
There's been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
Yeah, you're gonna have to walk me through that.
Yes. Maybe she'll feel so guilty, she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again.
So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.
No, you're the one who let him in.
Correct.
Cookies?
You want to be green?
Look at you, being all mature.
I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I'd do whatever they said. Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.
Absolutely. You name it, we're doing it.
I'm not upset. I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
It's okay.
How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?
Okay, we're headed out, see you later.
Penny?
Penny?
Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.
Hmm.
You're still awake?
Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
Read it back one more time.
Please?
Why would she do this to me?
That is a good point. But I didn't marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I'm being.
I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.
If you want, I can yell at you later.
You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.
Well, that's what the bullies at Bruce Lee's high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.
I don't know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?
We used the coordinates to locate the cities.
There's no way you could've known. Be right back. Excuse me?
Well, that's always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.
That's it. We're done with the questions.
That's it. That wasn't so bad.
That was a lot of puppies.
I was playing Got Your Nose. That's how you get children to like you.
No. Forget it.
Please don't.
Okay, let me see the damage.
She does.
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I'm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can't take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.
No.
I can't believe you don't trust me.
But it's an expression of our love.
I guess we'll have to make a new video together, as a couple.
Thank you for forgiving me.
Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
But it wasn't my fault. I didn't exclude him. And I didn't write the article.
You know how the PennySaver only has my name…
Well, why don't we take it home and put it in our freezer?
Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.
Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.
No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.
The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea, but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did.
They did.
We haven't been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.
And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.
So they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?
I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.
You could play Ping-Pong for it.
No, no, I like that show. It's got dragons and people doing it.
Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I'm a little nervous.
All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.
Don't listen to her. You and I go way back, we're like brothers.
So, what are you in for?
Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.
It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.
Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.
Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you're not in more stuff, man? I'd cast you in a minute.
Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.
No.
From a Kevin Smith movie?
Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.
Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in.
I'll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.
Why?
Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?
Great. Now that we're all on the same page, let's get together tonight and work on it.
Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.
I heard you can make good money doing that.
Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.
It's not always.
It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.
Are you still dating that dermatologist?
I got you a little something to cheer you up.
Really? That's amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.
You know what they all do, right?
Hey.
Well, however much money your father was giving you, I'll give you more.
Wrong. Obesity.
Guys. In the time you've been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.
You don't look very happy.
Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.
Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.
Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.
Whenever you're ready.
Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.
I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.
Hello.
You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.
Fine. I want black-tie.
Um, I'm free tonight.
Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?
Hmm?
Well, like I said, we're about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.
Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn't I invited to this?
Okay.
Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.
Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?
No. You wrote vows?
Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a ride.
Like you're doing right now?
I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?
I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.
Well, I may be a man, but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.
Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.
You can't be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you're gonna do the same with a random guy?
Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.
It's not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.
Hi. I'm calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we're just talking hours here.
I don't know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.
Then I won't say I'd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?
Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
Hey, you're early. The movie doesn't start for an hour.
It runs on syphilis?
Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around 'cause there's a worm inside.
So, Penny, how's married life?
I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it's to look like a Klingon.
We'll take you to the mall to get it done.
I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.
Yeah, isn't it gonna get worse the longer you wait?
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
Penny' I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.
Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.
Really? They didn't eat him?
Thermal Expansion.
We do?
Well, it's not like I'm never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.
I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I'd say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?
Hang on. Wait, you actually think it's 2003?
I think it's very cute.
You played it for Emily, didn't you?
Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That's my answer.
We're not afraid of physical activity.
When you're in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?
My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you're worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I'm going to touch you all over.
I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
That kind of stinks? Why aren't you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
Perform the experiment immediately.
If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.
What are you guys up to?
Uh-oh.
I had a great time last night.
And I'd love to take you out again”?
Can you give us a minute?
Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.
Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?
All right. Let's start over. I'm redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I'm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.
Look, uh, I don't even think you can take this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.
Oh, what's that ring box?
Oh, man, I'm sorry, that must have been devastating for you.
Huh.
This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I'm gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.
Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I'd always be there.
Dr. Dana feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?
You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
Well, he's smart, he's a respected scientist.
Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.
Um about an hour and half.
He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
I don't know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.
Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
I've been telling women that for 20 years.
Yes.
See you then.
Maybe I'm happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
That he's an ass? He beat you to it.
It's not working.
No, seriously. It's about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It's about, it's about simply being.
How can reading my journal be an accident?
OMG. OMG. We're so close to the new Star Wars. I can't take it. Gah. Gah?
And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.
Let's just play.
Well, I can't take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.
Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.
I told you if we were patient, he'd figure it out for himself.
Really? Why?
So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there's an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.
Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
Why is he looking at it?
It's about Amy.
Better. You're the lint trap of my love.
Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.
Obi-what?
Hello.
I, I can't believe it. I, I don't know what to say.
Have fun, guys.
That's okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I'll, I'm gonna go put these in water.
So, what'd you have in mind for tonight?
I'm just, um, really nervous.
Me, too.
I, I was just curious. How, how'd it go?
Well, the doctor's a woman, but yes, because you never know.
None of that is true.
Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.
I don't know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she's heard about the drug.
Pushover.
I will. And I really can't thank you guys enough.
You dream different than me.
Hi.
Got it.
Yeah, I know what you meant. Let's put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.
All of them?
Oh, I'm glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.
Ooh, we should watch that next girls' night.
No.
Oh, where are we going?
Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.
I feel so, so bad.
What trip to Las Vegas?
Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…
What do we do, kick them off?
Emily, as I'm sure you know, I'm considered an odd fellow. But what you don't know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.
And that's not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I'll see where she is.
Very. It's nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.
Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.
Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.
Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.
Fantasy seqeunce.
You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?
Oh, and speaking of Valentine's Day, I haven't forgotten about you tonight.
Do people like money? Is that what you're asking?
Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that's basically national sex night?
Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…
It is Valentine's Day. How about Valentino?
No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you're not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.
Congratulations on a successful live show.
Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
What?
Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
Uh, it's in the corner.
I kind of already do that for Howie.
And whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
I'd enjoy that.
What's it say?
Hey, guys. Congratulations.
A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.
Me, too.
Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.
He is?
I'm sold, you're ahead of Bale.
Can we just all agree we're worried about Affleck?
Little generic. Keep thinking. We'll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.
Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.
Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.
I know when I'm beat.
So, have you been having any morning sickness?
Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it's a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.
I know one way to find out. Sniff this.
I wonder how much she spent on this.
Um, you think you'd want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?
This contract looks good to me.
So, you're just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?
Hey, Raj. It's Claire. How are you?
Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow's on my spot.
Sheldon.
What?
Hey, guys.
You know what, this part isn't that technical. You actually could.
Sheldon, this is silly.
And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
Okay.
Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
Okay. That's cool. I guess everybody's involved in this project but me. So, see ya.
What are we gonna tell the girls?
All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?
Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Well, oh, it's just a, it's a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It's right next to the hockey puck dent.
You know what wasn't anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.
Should we invite Raj?
Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.
Have you ever been off the grid before?
No, not really.
You saw him carrying that.
Right. So all we need is to…
Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let's just circle back.
Wait, that's it.
Wow.
No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.
Well, we'll just see about that.
Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don't need a stupid meeting. We don't even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.
Well, I will still come to your meeting.
Actually, what you're doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.
You love The Simpsons.
Wait. You were pretending?
Just drop it.
Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?
I didn't say fun fact. I'm not a monster.
You know, it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.
Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you're free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.
Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn't weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.
Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You're strong, beautiful and tall.
I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.
Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
Okay.
That is very mature of you, so I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah.
When's the screening?
People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.
Penny, it's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?
We've waited in a lot of lines together, haven't we?
Oh, I'm not upset with you, but Amy's pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.
Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.
I'm back.
That's mean.
Uh, who made you line monitor?
Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?
Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I've been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I'm getting nowhere.
What about Joss Whedon's work makes you think he'd be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.
I know, and there's no excuse for that.
Okay, Mary.
I've always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.
I can't believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.
Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.
Guys, come on. We're meeting everyone for dinner.
I don't have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that's very interesting.
Well, thank you.
I'd be lost without you.
Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
What is happening there?
Yeah, drive safe.
A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You're kind of a sucker.
You're not seriously going to visit each other.
What you've gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?
Why wouldn't that colonel say what the meeting's about? It has to be bad news.
Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I'm sorry, did you two want to sit together?
Urgh.
Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can't wait any longer.
All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.
Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
Oh, but you did it so well. That's amazing, it's like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.
Hmm. Well, I guess it's just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.
Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?
Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.
Oh, Leonard's mad at me, so I'm making him lemon bars.
Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.
Look, I'm sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.
Why would you do that?
We didn't. Sheldon did.
Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.
Oh, hi.
We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
You shouldn't have made the alarm code his birthday.
Huh, what?
I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk's delicious watery cousin.
Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, 'cause you're you and I'm me, and it's kind of embarrassing.
What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?
My head hurts and I'm more tired than ever.
No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.
So?
I do.
Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?
Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.
So you know the sex of our baby, and we don't?
God, Raj.
Cutting between Penny's apartment and Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
Now, now, there's no need to make this emotional.
No, but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack.
I'm so sore. I don't think I slept two minutes last night.
I feel like I pulled something. Why didn't you tell me to stop?
Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
I'm sorry for bringing this over here.
I think we should see other people.
There she is. Who's ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?
Damn, so did I.
Let me know when you start, because that wasn't funny.
Did they?
If you ever need somewhere to crash, there's always my place.
It's just so much easier to give him what he wants.
And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?
I'm sure you're right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.
Yeah, just give me a minute.
We're back.
Oh, yeah.
All right, fine. Let's say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it's not a West Coast party, 'cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don't stop.
The guy at the dealership said they're not just for moms anymore.
Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.
Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee's.
Been hearing that a lot today.
Should've punched that guy.
We're so sorry.
I also love how you never use swear words.
So?
I'll take that as a yes. She's secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven't noticed.
Oh, wait, stop that.
Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend's wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.
Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that's my room.
Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?
Do you like living with her?
Do you know what you need to do now?
You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.
That's because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
Good, you know, in case the exit isn't clearly marked.
Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you're as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.
Oh, really? You made Cuban food?
Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some.
You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you'd like to…
Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
So I was thinking, you know, engineers don't get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?
It's a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I'm jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.
Thanks, Leonard, now he's not gonna think I'm cool.
How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you're brilliant?
It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that's here, cool.
Thank you. And it's only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.
That's Raj.
Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.
Sheldon, I'm warning you, I can play this game, too.
Thank you again for cooking. It's getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.
Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?
I'm sorry. It's our first time.
Uh.
Raj.
I'm sorry.
No.
I'm not an old man, I just can't see at night.
And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.
Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?
Of course.
Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
Welcome to Texas.
Flashback.
What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?
Flashback.
I was going chronologically. You're right between Koothrappali's father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.
Why would you do that?
What happened
You do make a cute elf.
It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they're doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.
Thank you, Internet. I'm telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.
Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.
Bernie?
I didn't know what else to do. It worked.
Not me, paternity leave.
Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that's it.
Some wine.
This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about it.
Bye.
Yeah, I'll miss you too.
I don't want to wait two days for us to work this out.
Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just 'cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.
You know what? If you'd like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I'm at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.
Don't do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.
There's a cucumber in my water.
I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
