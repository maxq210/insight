I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.
Not with commentary.
Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
No.
It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last.
Hang on.
Of course not.
If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.
Oh, no, no, no, well now, there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.
I don't want my job back. I've spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I'm going to savour it.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?
Isn't it?
Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.
This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone's mother.
It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.
Leonard?
Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
I'm the Doppler Effect.
Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves.
Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.
Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
Yes. If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers.
Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.
No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree.
Then it's not dancing night.
Tonight is Halo night, it's like talking to a wall.
No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.
What?
Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.
Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.
Excuse me, little idea?
Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.
Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.
Yes. I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.
Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard, …..
For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.
I'm very congested.
Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.
Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They'll come, they'll settle and I'll win the prize…
Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
I'm a theoretical physicist.
I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.
Good luck.  By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system.
Yes, I suppose he is.
No. That's Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…
Well I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity? Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
There's no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.
I said Good Day!
Don't be ridiculous, you love trains.
That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…
Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can't tell Dad.
Oh no.
Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.
Leonard's asleep.
Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don't have a problem.
Yes?
In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you'll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.
I'm invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
Dill slices, not sweet?
Who touched my…
You're sitting in my spot.
Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.
Penny.
Where are you going?
Fine, whatever works.
It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I'll find us seats.
Yes, I'm aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.
So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
Oh, Penny. I know you think you're being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven't given me a gift, you've given me an obligation.
Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.
Too bad. If it'd been a friend, I'm available to fill the void.  It's just as well, she smelled like moth balls.
Oh! I love trains!
Oh my! That's awfully sticky. Alright, let's see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It's probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn't you agree?
Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?
Little kid Hominids, perhaps.  Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.
They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.
I envy you your childhood.
Oh, I can't believe that.
What difference does it make?
Yes.
Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.
Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.
Put down the letters!
Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.
Want me to show my work?
No problem. I'll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!
You're tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?
Good. See how it's done, Leonard?
You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
I need it for my Robin collection.
So, I win.
That's preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered, I just don't see it.
Sing soft kitty.
Sleepy kitty.
It won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”
I did.
I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That's an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley's chicken.
Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.
Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.
I'm the boss. I make the jokes.
Astro means star.
I said give it to me.
In this context for me could mean with me.
I walked.
I can't. There's a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.
I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.
When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's?
Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.
Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
Thank you. I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.
Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.
Come on, come on, we're late.
I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we'll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.
Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It's pledge week and they're trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.
All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.
How else are you gonna study for the tests?
This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we're going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
Oh!
Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?
I don't need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott's mathematical fantasy, Flatland.
Well, you're in luck, there's a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there's a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.
It's a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
We scored. I'm the wingman.
Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don't think the two of you'd be comfortable on the couch.
Good thinking. Perhaps I'll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
I'm fine. Although I'm no longer the master of my own bladder.
Then I've been up all night.
Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it's always hexagonal…
Shouldn't you check your database?
All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here's your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It's a little unconventional, but I think you'll like it. It's zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit.
Yes.
No, that seemed a little farfetched.
Morning, old chum.
Hello.
I don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.
Oh, I don't want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?
Now you see what you've done? Because of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee.
Well, you're my friends. You'll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious.
I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
Thank you. Yeah, I'll bear that in mind if I'm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.
That's a lot of money for only one colour.
I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.
Uh-oh.
I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
I'm hungry now.
I was talking with Penny.
Hold on. Nope, no reason.
Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!
I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
It's a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.
She's not my girlfriend.
I have a master's degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.
I'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?
Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It's over 14 hours in Southern California.
I've decided not to procreate.
A hybrid dog and octopus. Man's underwater best friend.
A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy.
One question.
It'll also help improve her initial impression of you.
He does it all the time. He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
I've found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
Go north. You can't go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don't have the sword. Good golly, it's as if it's actually happening to me.
Well, no-one's going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.
Oh, I've heard of that place, isn't that Pasadena's favourite Irish watering hole.
Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
That's not how it looks in the picture.
Did Leonard? I'm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh, good. I'm eight for 26 this month.
A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.
I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.
Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell's Angel.
Of course. We're coming as the Justice League of America.
This is how the Flash paces.
But they're not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?
I'm Kermit. You're Scooter.
No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat. I'll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.
Oh, dear Lord, shush.
Playing the theremin.
Probably going to have to throw them away.
I didn't say that. But no, I don't.
Excuse me. We're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
Isn't that their burden? I'm the one with something interesting to say.
So, when could we start?
Gotcha.
Hoo!
I'm sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
Penny, you're an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.
Oh, come on! Why not?
Right. I'll make tea.
I'm sorry. It's not optional.
But tonight's Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.
Thank you.
Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I'm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning's ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.
I hate you.
What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man's battle ostrich?
She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
Why are you smiling?
Oh, I'm back to trains. Woo-woo.
No.
Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn't been such a hound dog, we'd all have time machines.
Sorry, I have company.
I'm glad you think so. That's what I strive to emulate.
Fine, I'll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother's mantel.
Finally.  Oh, what fresh hell is this?
No, I can't authorize that.
I never kid about safety.
Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.
Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.
No, you weren't listening. She said, it's not what it looks like.
I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.
Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned.  As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. .  Penny.  Penny.   Penny.
Oh, I'm not buying anything. They're having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.
All this years, I've been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.
Mm. Tough decision. There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
You've already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.
The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.
Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.
Holy smoke, why didn't I think of that? You're a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!
Where are you going?
Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.
Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who's a good Amy.
You clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone's snuggle bunny!
It's remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He's magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven't offered you a beverage.
How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!
Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can't until you admit the problem.
Where's Stuart?
Am I okay? Leonard, I'm on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?
Don't be silly. I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.
Penny.  Amy.  Bernadette.
Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.
And there's the first zinger. Ouch.
Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you're a mess.
Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?
You know what would be nice?
And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?
You're right, the tiara was too much.
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them, they'll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.
Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he's being murdered. Now, back to our game.
Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
What's that?
Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?
And I'm sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We're in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.
Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a . Okay. No, no. I'll start over. Professor
I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse's back? Ha-ha, I'm a freak!
That my genius…
Dibs.
What are you doing here, Kripke?
I'm sorry. We just need a word.
Hello.
Fine, let's go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.
Hmm, well, it's a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.
MUON!
Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
Oh!
Of course.
That's a lot of belt buckles.
My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.
A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever's in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!
I just had cobbler.
Yes. You're my ride.
It's not fair. Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.
That is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She's pretty mad.
Two cherries?
What kind of tea would you like?
What are you smiling at?
Yes.
Why's that?
You insulted my woman. I'm here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.
Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.
I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
Oh, hello.
Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That's one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.
While unlikely, it's still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.
Very well. You leave me no choice.
I think you're high on paint fumes. And boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.
Sadly, yes. Amy's taking me to a memorial service. It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he'll never make his way back to China.
And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.
You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I'm deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.
Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about. I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.
Don't waste my time.
It's a possibility.
I didn't notice.
Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
Mmm.
She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?
Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don't know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it's clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?
Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn't diminish my output. You know, I'm like the sun. Can't turn this off.
Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
Bad. However…
Okay, because that was not clear.
Oh, quite sure.  That proves nothing.
And a complete sucker.
Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It's nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.
I know it doesn't seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.
Here's something else you don't know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
Penny, it's your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.
Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.
Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.
And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.
Think of me when you apply it.
I don't think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.
Well, I hope you're wrong. I really want to go to the train store.
I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.
Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.
Howard, if you're going to lie to your wife, don't start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That's a dead giveaway.
Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?
Well, I cannot give this stuff away.
Is it me, or does she not look so good?
Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?
This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.
Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.
What?
I'm sorry, did I wake you?
Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.
I'll get Leonard.
No. He died when I was 14.
She's so tiny. It's funny when she's mad.
Yes.
Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn't relate to that?
I do see what you're saying. That helps.
By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.
Well, I never told you about my brother's kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family's genitals?
I've read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
No.
Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.
You know, I'd love to, but, um, I'm too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.
It is hideous.
I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.
How long have you been involved with him?
Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
No, don't look to Him. He's mad at you right now.
Leonard?
I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.
Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.
Oh, no. What have I done?
Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?
Hello. I didn't expect you this evening.
Why are you here?
Wow. A Death Star cake.
No, I do. You're upset about Emily and you're Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
You're right. I'll take that out.
Of course. She's spent many nights here, and you're worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.
How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
No.
Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.
My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It's called living off the land.
You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I'm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.
Or had a single piece of fruit.
Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?
It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That's rich. I'll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.
How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
Howard's allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?
I suppose that's a fair request. There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience.
What are you doing?
Well, not just him. May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.
Absolutely not.
It has avocado on it. She's allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.
Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.
No. You're crazy about me.
Well, you didn't suggest a beach house.
Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?
We're not stopping.
Making the extra effort. Good for you.
Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.
You think you've got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…
18 parts per million. And he's still doing it.
Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I'd like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.
Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.
Who eats them horizontally?
No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what's comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman's face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it's poster time.
Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.
How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.
Okay.
But I just got this pen. It's got my initials on it and everything. Look.
Thank you for walking me home.
Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.
No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn't say enough nice things about it.
Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.
Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I'll have fries with that. Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences.
Will you please play the game? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?
All right, we've defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.
I'll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.
Perhaps you'd prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.
All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
It actually says at least?
Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.
Amy's upset? Is it about me?
Oh, you're going to a wedding alone? That's sad.
Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.
You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, 'cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.
It's not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.
No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might've said yes.
But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.
No, what I'm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.
But mostly here.
All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I'll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we're good.
Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?
Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.
Thanks. And I taste good too.
She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.
Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.
Oh, no, it's all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.
One minute is a long time.
and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I'd wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.
I don't know if I'd call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let's see, what's next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.
Where are you going?
Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.
Still hasn't bought milk even though I told him two days ago.
Now, this isn't about us, this is about what's best for the asteroid.
I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.
You know how, when you're sick, you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people's feelings don't matter?
Very well. Stuart.
You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.
Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…
Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!
That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her.
It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.
Yes.
Thank you.
I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.
I guess we'll call this a draw.
And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they're just extremely irritating.
Well, that's not fair. We should all get plaques.
Great. Now I'm gonna have that song in my head all day.
Thanks.
So I drink.
No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn't, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.
No, he didn't do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren't you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.
I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?
Oh, I haven't asked it yet.
What, why did you get a party sub?
Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport?
You know, right now, at the back of this line, there's a movie fan like you who's not going to get in, because this person simply doesn't care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.
It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
I hope you're right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother's wife is weird.
Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what's wrong?
Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn't you ever think, hey, that could be me?
Okay, Howard's on board. What do you think, Leonard?
We don't need Howard's cousin. No, we have me.
Oh, that was never happening.
No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can't stop.
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.
Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.
No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you'll never learn.
You know, in fact, I'd like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.
You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.
Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.
You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.
I can't take this any more.  Bert.  Bert.  Bert.
Yes, that's right. I have Amy. In the past, you've professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don't?
I didn't punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I'm not even sure he knows I did it.
Oh, actually, I would.
Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.
Yeah, take whatever you want.
In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals.
Yes, you're in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.
I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.
Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.
I was acting odd intentionally.
At our age, why don't we call it man's night?
Bye.
You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?
