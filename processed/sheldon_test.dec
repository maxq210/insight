Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.
Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”
I resent you saying we don't have company.
Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed.
Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.
Yeah, those are men who just had sex.
Goodbye, peasants.
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
Not if you're a rugby team.
If I could of, I would of.
At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.
I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
This party is just going to suck.
Yet another child left behind.
Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.
Okay, that is it.
Yes.
Is that a relevant factor?
Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.
No, I made him up. I think you'd call him Lee.
Un-unravelable.
I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.
No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.
Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.
Alright.
Screw him, he was weak.
Leslie Winkle?
Formal protest.
No. I decline to provide one.
Formal protest.
There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
Wait a minute, I'd want to see that too.
Well of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd.
She's my twin sister, she thinks she's funny but frankly I've never been able to see it.
No we don't.
Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.
I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.
Something he wouldn't buy for himself. Something fun. Something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router.
Yeah, I suppose.
This is not a tangerine bicycle.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.
Well, statistically speaking…
I don't care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
Penny.
Do you know, it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.
Smart? I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
Alright then.
They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.
I can't wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.
Drink a healing potion.
He gets a new office, I can't even get paper towels in the men's room?
Penny. Didn't you recently state that you and I are friends?
What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
Yeah, well, I know that now.
It's what I do.
You heard her. How can I argue with me?
Now! Do it!
Godzilla clause?
Maybe when I publish it, I'll include an inhaler.
Well, I'm sorry, but that is your second strike.
Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?
Penny. Zucchini bread.
She's right, as long as you're vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.
Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.
I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
For how…
There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.
Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
Have faith, gentlemen. We don't need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?
Hi.
Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn't returned any of my calls because I hadn't offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… I see. Well then perhaps you'd have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… I see. No, no, no, wait. Don't hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I'm sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.
No? But we're friends!
You're clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.
And I told you I wanted to see a doctor's note.
You claim it's going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.
All right.
Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
Here. I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.
All right.
You're holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You'll hear a slight click.
So, Penny has a don't knock on my door before eleven o'clock  or I punch you in the throat rule.
Excuse me.
I think you're just making that up.
There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
You're tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?
Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we're going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let's call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.
Well, I've spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.
So, I win.
Okay, I'm sleepy now, get out.
I agree. It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
I need access to the Cheesecake Factory's walk-in freezer.
I'm sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?
Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.
So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
What's going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
One at a time.  What was that?
Fine, if you don't want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
Did you? I didn't notice. Have a chocolate.
I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I'm just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.
If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.
And you've continued to take the university's money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
Nevertheless, I didn't say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.
I can't.
Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
How would you put it?
Don't flatter yourself. I'm just ignoring you.
Shall I come back at a better time?
They're holding umbrellas.
All right.
Don't look?
Kidney disease?
Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…
Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I'm sorry you had to hear that.
Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It's pledge week and they're trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.
You flatter me, sir.
Can't you surprise him in some other way? For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.
How else are you gonna study for the tests?
Oh!
If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.
Leonard, I'm no expert on meditation, but if you're trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.
September 22nd.
Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.
Better.
Impaired cognitive function.
Nope.
Heated to 180 degrees?
You had gelato with Stan Lee?
Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell. At Stan Lee's house. We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.
We're not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
Yes, there is. Oh, here's a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.
You mean my ring?
I'm not accepting the award.
Oh, I doubt that. I haven't figured out a way, and I'm much smarter than all of you.
Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it's really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes.  Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.
I'm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I'll get you ice cream!
No, I suppose not.
Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
I'm hungry now.
Hold on. Nope, no reason.
Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention.
Point taken. You may want to sit up.
No, Goofy, no.
Dr. Plimpton, I'd like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
I should've brought an umbrella.
All right, let me restate that. It's very heavy, and I don't want to.
FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
Sorry. I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
Curses.
Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA?
By this much.
No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.
In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.
If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.
There being no objections…
Well, the status is as it always was. She's a girl. She's a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.
It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?
Did you know that, Leonard?
Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.
I'll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
And Raj.
Sure you can, you're doing fine, it's very believable.
I'm going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn't notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?
Yes.
You'll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…
All right. To the metric system.  I can't taste the cherries.
No, you can't reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk.
Nevertheless, I've hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.
If it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.
Thank you.
Who.
The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I'll need time to make things right.
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.
Don't. He's making our case.
Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter!  Fine.
Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We'll need snacks.
Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
Raj?  Raj?  Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?
It's the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain't foolin' no one, and get your shotgun!
Mommy, why are you crying? ‘Cause I'm gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.
You know, it's a shame, all that work she's doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.
What?
The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?
We had a good run, you and I.
Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.
They stole everything, Leonard, everything.
That's uncanny.
Forgive my language, but poppycock.
Yes, I believe so.
Did you get that?
But…
Shotgun.
No, thank you, but for the record, I'm an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.
is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
Fascinating.
Eight.
That's because it's simple.
No, I haven't. It's all good.
Subtlety isn't her strong suit, is it?
No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that's what we're going to be.
Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I'm going to experience an episode from my past.  I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't be mad at me. Don't do that!
I don't want to talk about it. But it's not a spine,I'll tell you that.
Only 8,000? We're wasting precious time. Buy it.
Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother's fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.
Careful, you're using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.
I'm not going, and you can't make me.
Thanks, Mom.You're the best.
Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.  Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.
Leonard doesn't have time to chat, he has to get the mail.
Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.
The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.
You're biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That's a living thing, get cracking.
Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that's cool.
Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can't until you admit the problem.
Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes. We're playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie.
Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?
Penny.
Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?
You know what would be nice?
I'm not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.
I don't need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.
Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.
It's after nine o'clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.
Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
Oh, he'll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he's gonna be bored out of his mind.
Yes. That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
I tried once. They do men's and women's hair in the same room at the same time. It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs.  Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.
Yeah, please, Amy! It's got lightsabres!
Then no. What else?
Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.
Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
Oh, good. Hah-hah!
Oh, nice job, man-hands.
Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let's all be mad at Stuart.
Oh!
Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I've made, he'll reach out to me.
Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.
My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
Wrong. Leonard?
Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.
You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
Ah, much better.
And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you're not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there's only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that's called school.
It's awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it's usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.
I'm in hell, Leonard. Don't stop.
Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?
Attaboy!
Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.
What are you doing here?
Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I'm going to pause to let that sink in.
Oh, I don't know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.
The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
Welcome aboard, old chum.
Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they're all out.
Hurry up, find him, find him.
Wait. I'm a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
What's your point?
Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play.  Stephen Hawking.  Stephen Hawking.  Stephen Hawking.
No. It would appear as if I've lost him. Stupid brain.
Oh, but I want to be Hawking's friend.
What's wrong?
You'll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me. Tell him you're not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.
I just told you.
To be honest, I didn't know you were here.
You don't need an Iron Man helmet. You're not Iron Man.
No, I don't.
Well, Howard, thank you. It's quite a gesture on your part. You've shown yourself to be the bigger man.
Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.
I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I've reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies.
Human Resources Department.  Human Resources Department.  Human Resources Department.
I hate this planet.
I'll eat later. Right now, I'm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.
There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don't know where you're from, but where I'm from, that means I'm not doing okay.
Yes.
Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
Leonard, wait.
You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
Hold on. If you don't want to live with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?
Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
Oh, you caught that, did you?
Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let's knock them off.
What's wrong?
Why would I do that?
We're not. This time you're the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Please, Leonard, he said it's okay.
I won't be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.
What? That was ambiguous.
I don't know what you're doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.
No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.
Oh, that's nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don't care how they end.
…tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let's say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?
It's happening. Leonard, it's happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I'd find a tactful way to do that.
Leonard, are you in bed?
Do you have cufflinks?
Yes. And if there's time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
And now what?
Fine, no more drowning talk. I'll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?
Oh, dear Lord, a police officer's glancing in our direction. We've been made.
If I make this move, but I won't because we're having too much fun.
Um, uh, in a hundred years, you'll both be dead and it won't matter?
Don't try and trick me into buying something I don't want. Now let's talk Aquaman.
Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.
You say you're from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?
Joke if you must, but you're going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.
Twelve hundred dollars. That's my final offer.
Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.
What's odd is they're in the trash can.
She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.
No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It's based on the premise that Princeton isn't a very good school.
Got it.
Okay, another 30 feet.
Why? So you can see the look on Amy's face when she hears my top-notch idea?
Uh, it also wouldn't have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.
Let's see, what's next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.
Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.
No, no, no. I'm really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?
I'm surprised to see you here.
None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.
The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?
I'm back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I'm sick of Wolowitz, too.
I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.
And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.
I would've preferred to have you there with me.
Should I follow you?
Why don't you ask her?
I'm going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  Penny. Sorry.
Leonard, wait. Take me with you.
Wow. Didn't see that coming.
Do you see me drinking lemonade?
Do not stop refreshing your screens.
I didn't even get to that part.
No. No, I've changed. Like the frog who's put in a pot of water that's heated so gradually he doesn't realize he's boiling to death.
It is hideous.
In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
I'm not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it's like to see your mother ravaging someone?
You, aren't you gonna come with me?
But I'm a professional scientist.
I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can't keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.
Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.
Hawkman. It's your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn't pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.
Oh. Who knows?
Ha. The opposite. She's a neurobiologist, and I'm a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.
Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren't.
Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I'll never hear that laugh again.
Oh, I'm fine. Why did you come?
Why would I? That's where all the cool trains are.
Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
No.
How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
Leonard?
Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?
Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?
It's called parallel play.
Well, you didn't suggest a beach house.
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.
He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
You tell me. I feel like I can't breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.
It's dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I'm back at square one. And, frankly, it's frightening.
It's too late for Koothrappali. Let's go.
His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
No, I'd look silly in that helmet.
Very well. I'm done talking about it.
You don't, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.
Amy, he's my best friend, and if you don't take me, I'm going there anyway.
A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don't care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he's okay.
How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.
I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.
Let's celebrate.
Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.
Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.
Is that true?
I'm not going to work today. And would you like to know why?
I like it. I think you're on to something.
Fine, I'll take it back.
Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.
Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn't you try to help me?
How does that work?
Oh, that's nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.
That's it?
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I'm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can't take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
Oh, maybe you're right. He is kind of a lump.
And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let's see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo.
So they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?
You're blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.
Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.
Hello.
Certainly.
And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
You act like I didn't get you that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.
Of course not. I love you. I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.
You remember my mother.
Okay.
Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.
Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.
Glad you asked. As I see it, there's a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.
Oh, and how do you think you're going to get me to do that?
Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.
Well, it's not like I'm never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.
Well, that's unacceptable.
That's ridiculous.
It's a Pokémon reference.
Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today?
Where does he work?
How many questions are too many questions?
I can't find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
Oh, it's nice to meet you. I admire your father's work very much. It's not every day I get to meet someone whose life's journey began in my hero's scrotum.
Are you sure? I've heard that on those sites, often when you think you're corresponding with someone, it's actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.
That's it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.
and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I'd wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.
All right. Well, what should we talk about?
I'm, I'm sorry; I didn't realize you were on a date.
Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I'd like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.
You're back.
So, can you help me?
Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.
Hello.
All right. Hello.
Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn't have the history with the franchise I do.
Mm, that's a great question. I like when they're next to a Chipotle.
Oh. I guess I'm a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.
We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn't do Uranus any favours.
It's perfect. It appears romantic, but it's really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever.
Even the girls.
Physically, yes, but I'm upset because everyone's mad at me for no good reason.
You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.
I'm afraid it can't. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.
Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?
I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don't you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.
No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It's not my fault she died when you were four.
Amy, why don't you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.
No, I wouldn't.
I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.
Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn't good for us.
Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I'm grateful for having gone through it.
But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I'm gonna count all those nostril hairs.
Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.
Thanks.
He says he's not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?
He wants to see I.D.
All right, back to learning.
Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.
Stuart, what are you doing here?
Oh, well, that's laying it on a little thick.
Did you see that? He just cut the line.
Okay. Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things to my mother?
Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what's wrong?
Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can't wait any longer.
And look how irritable it's making you!
I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
Well, you've lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?
Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.
Which side of the bed would you prefer?
No, but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack.
What are you doing down there?
You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.
Do you know what else I love about you?
Well, whatever it is, it's troubling me. And I can't eat, I can't sleep. And don't even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.
Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that's related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.
No, this is for science. I can be brave for science.
I understand. She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.
You know what? This isn't gonna work.
I can't. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.
Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
Anything to drink?
Bye.
Interesting. The world's most boring liquid and the world's most boring vegetable, but you put 'em together and bleugh.
