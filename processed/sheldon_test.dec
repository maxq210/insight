No, that was the result of my work with lasers.
In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I've made my point.
You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
No.
There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!
Wooh, I'm all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.
Penny for your thoughts.
That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?
If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.
Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.
This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.
I'm taking a sabbatical, because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds.
Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.
I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.
Hello.
Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.
Yet another child left behind.
If he understands that, you're in trouble.
Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.
It's Halo night.
Hi.
It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one's children enter the medical profession.
It's a children's story.
When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.
Hello Penny.
Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.
I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there's just no pleasing you.
, too late, I win.
Is that a relevant factor?
Yes, well, he lied.
No, of course not, there's no cousin Leo, there's no intervention, focus Leonard.
For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
Think woman, who blew their nose and when?
On Sunday?
Get him out Leonard.
I've decided you're right. My career is not over.
Why?
You're welcome. One more thing.
Gentlemen.
Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?
Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here.
Again, time machine.
What's the number, I'll match it.
No. I can't let you do this.
You hypocrite!
Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.
Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.
Something he wouldn't buy for himself. Something fun. Something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router.
Really?
Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
AFK. Away from keyboard.
Level three and she thinks she's rich! What a noob.
Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.
Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I'm going to take action.  Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?
These are market research questions. I'm filling out the online registration for your game.
Oh, sorry.
Damn, this is hard.
Penny. Didn't you recently state that you and I are friends?
Oh, but I'm not going home. It's Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it's creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there's a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.
Yes. Apparently I'm getting a free dinner.
I prefer to think of it as I'm pulling them forward.
All right.
What happened?
Leonard is going to  the office.
No.
Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
The statement stands for itself.
This is Stephanie's facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?
I'm helping you with Stephanie.
Like a gladiator!
It's not enough that she mocks me, but that isn't even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.
Didn't they teach you that in medical school?
His name is Monte.
Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.
What'd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
First warning.
I'm confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you're back in. He likes monkeys.
Well, you didn't specify.
Oh, I see. Penny, I'm not sure I'm comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.
That's why it's guarded by snakes. Take some.
I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
You're clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.
So, what do you think?
No. No, this isn't right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.
I still don't like this cushion.
We're not flying, we're taking the train.
I'm confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
Oh, I hate when that happens.
Obviously, not a cleaning business.
But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
Before taxes.
I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
No problem. I'll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!
Hello.
Good. See how it's done, Leonard?
May I interject something here?
Well apparently the news didn't reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Darn tootin', I win.
Great restraint on my part.
You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you've fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here's a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.
Yes.
Penny.
That feels like a bonus question. I'm going to stop here while I'm ahead, but I've had a great time.
Comforting is a part of leadership. It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden.
It is remarkable.
Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I'd call you when I got home, I'm not home yet.  Alright, I'm home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn't say that. I'm entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I'm home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.
And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?
No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
Oh, you'd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
For me.
There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
I said give it to me.
Fine.  Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!
Brimstone.
Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.
Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.
Sheldon's log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship.
I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  Penny.  Penny.  Penny..
Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
There is no abort.
I made a boo-boo, all right?
Leonard.
Don't Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.
My mother was right. Hell is real.
Why can't Leonard teach you?
She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?
I don't drink.
It means come in. It's taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.
Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.
What if someone steals my keys?
Better.
It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.
Einstein.
That seems acceptable.
Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?
I've lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don't care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.
I'd be much further along if I'd been allowed to practice.
It's actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.
Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.
Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it's supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.
But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
I was found guilty and fined $533.
The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.
I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It's not astonishing, more like inevitable. I'm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I'm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.
Okay, but don't punch me.
So, I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.
I'm getting dizzy.
Oh, I'm ready. I don't know if Stuart told you what you're up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny's pretty good.
No, it's not the… Never mind.
You weren't the ball.
Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.
Good, good. I'm glad we're still friends.
Perhaps you're getting a brain tumour.
Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard.
Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.
And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
That's what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.
He's an odd duck, isn't he?
I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.
He must be very skilled at coitus.
All right, let me restate that. It's very heavy, and I don't want to.
Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.
Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.
Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
It's a small price to pay.
All right.
It's how they lure you in. I believe it's called bait and switch.
Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
Oh, gentlemen.
I'll go as high as 40.
I did.
Why would I touch her, she's covered with airplane germs.
Very well, I'm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.
I came to go over your alibi for last night.
The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.
No.
Sleep eludes me, Leonard.
Oh, shut up.
More or less.
Hello, all.
And here's where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.
Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can't see it, no one else can see it.
Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?
What is the best number? By the way, there's only one correct answer.
The alternative would be to think backwards. And that's just remembering.
Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
Oh, I know. I'm now an independent contractor.
But I made it better.
I'm sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.
Bored.
Can you guarantee that it won't happen at any time during the night?
Excuse me. We're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
All right, why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic.
Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal. (Howard throws walkie-talkie out of window)
I'm sorry. You'll be Spock?
Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!
Okay, I see what's happening.
Un momento. Oh, for heaven's sake, now you're being deliberately stupid.  Where are you going?
I said, ta-da. Show's over.
Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there's no monkey business.
Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?
You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?
No.
Thank you, Penny.
Have you learned anything?
Pun intended?
It's what I do. But wait, there's more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.
Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.
Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh, nice touch, by the way.
If I could, I would, but I can't, so I shan't. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that's what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let's put on our thinking cap, shall we?  Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.  Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That's a true blue friend.
Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Penny.  Penny.  Penny.
No.
Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.
The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?
Let's see what I'll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn't know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.
Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.
Not yet.
Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother's fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.
Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.
All right, Mom. When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son, believe it, because it's true.
That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper.
Thanks, Mom.You're the best.
Open the mail!
Sorry. I'm a little distracted. I can't seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.
Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.
Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.
I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I'm good at this.
I'm in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.
In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.
Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?
Oh, there it is, tacos.
Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I'm not gonna lie, feels pretty good.
Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
I told you.
Where?
I've got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
Oh, no, of course. I understand. You're afraid the world isn't ready for your taboo love. Your secret's safe with me.
All right. That's it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.
You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?
And your father? Alive?
Can't help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.
Oh, President Siebert, I assume you'd like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.
Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.
Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse's back? Ha-ha, I'm a freak!
I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
Kripke?
Kripke. Come in. I'm making tea. Would you like a cup?
No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn't have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?
No, I'm not all right. It's been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.
Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen. But I see your point.
That's okay, I never understood them anyway.
The online game? Bully!
No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren't anything but flippin' pains in the bottom.
Penny!  Penny!  Penny!
Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.
Now that you're in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party.
Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
Oh!
Oh!
Walking away.
My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
Every time you drink alcohol.
The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we're going to be a faceless mass of six.
Penny?  Penny?  Penny?
My point is I don't like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we're on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I'm not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.
Leonard? Maybe you'd like to go with them to meet girls.
I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.  I trust you paid off those parking tickets.
Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.
Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn't enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.
Darts is a bar game. You've been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
Friends! It's Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I'll have everything I've ever wanted since I was six years old.
Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking.
It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I'm spanking him so hard his grad students won't be able to sit down.
I won't. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.
So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I'm having a tea party.
Wouldn't you like to know?
You're asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I'll choose.  You were so good in Stand by Me.
You think you don't care?
That's my parking spot.
Just breaking in your new car.
It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.
How can you sleep? I'm not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.
No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up.
Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn't kill a man. You know, it's a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.
Excuse me. You're not supposed to be enjoying this.
Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words 'tis and 'twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?
Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.
Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.
No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.
Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.
I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.
Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.
Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.
Well, I say that's the last time we ever go outside.
Nobel. Kripke. Don't look at my board.
Tea is for when I'm upset. I'm not upset. The university's forcing me to work with Kripke. I'm outraged.
No, look.
Well, word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.
It's a possibility.
Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That's Leonard's.
Um…
Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.
Um…
Um… Well… You are black, right?
Of course I do.
The third floor landing. The poor old guy's been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It's really you.
There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
Go on, give him your lunch money.
Fine, I'll do it.
Great. I'll go first.
Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.
Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.
All right, I'll give you that one.
I suppose so.
I'm a real collector. How rare is it?
I'm sorry. I'm just distracted by something that happened over at Penny's.
Maybe there's a third option.
A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.
That's amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.
No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It's based on the premise that Princeton isn't a very good school.
I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody's.
And I think I've got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?
Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That's strange, since peanut butter wasn't introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.
Why not? Hairy Fairy.
Dr. Fowler?
You're not listening to my side of it.
Zone.
Oh, great. Now I'm worse than a fraud. I'm practically a biologist.
I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.
Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.
Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I'm annoying. Say it. Say it. I'm annoying. Say it.
Mmm. You know, I've been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I'd love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.
You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
No, it's not. I've seen things. Lady things.
Penny, for the thousandth time, I'm saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud.
Oh, he didn't perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.
Kumquat?
Would you like to talk about it?
Where are you going?
What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where's my lemonade?
Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.
I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You're gonna feel pretty silly when we're 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.
How do you know this isn't a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?
I didn't even get to that part.
Can you recommend a surface you haven't had coitus on?
Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas.
Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.
Have you considered studying standard model physics?
Do you know what's great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That's fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.
Where are we going?
What is it?
If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.
I'm okay. How was the funeral?
You're back.
And you couldn't put it out?
Really? It's soaking wet.
Can you break a twenty?
Of course you are.
I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn't want you to think less of me.
That's right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?
You take that back.
I suppose that's a fair request. There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience.
He's right. And given that you're probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I'm sure you do suck.
On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next.
Because if she hadn't, she'd still be wading through the list.
If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty's hover board, that would have universal application.
I miss the old days when I couldn't tell.
It's dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I'm back at square one. And, frankly, it's frightening.
True. Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon.
My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.
There are post-prom mating rituals?
What's going on is we're about to go to a prom. And there's a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.
You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
I do. And I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn't at his bedside to say I told you so.
No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.
Penny?
You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.
He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?
Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.
How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Okay, that's great. Now, let it go.
That sounds like us. I still don't understand why you're upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
You didn't even let me finish.
Well, I don't enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director's Cut.
Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn't that right, Giuseppe?
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I'm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can't take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.
Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.
Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.
All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.
Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.
I guess news travels fast. It's true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn't included.
I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.
Leonard, who's really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?
Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can't miss it.
At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.
All right.
What about this one?
Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.
I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
Yes.
Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?
Raj, you're probably wondering why Amy and I aren't showing any affection to one another.
Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.
Everybody hold on. Let's take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we're calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it's leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.
What is that awful smell?
You know what they don't sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.
Thank you for letting me come speak with you.
No, just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional. And since it is 2003, I don't know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.
Nah, I'll do it tomorrow.
Uh, yes, I'm aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I'll get called into Human Resources.
Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.
It scared me straight, Leonard.
Uh-oh. What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?
Very well, then. I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning.
It's called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.
Well, I'm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can't. Something's wrong with me.
All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You're good friends with my mom. I know I've spent my life denying that you exist.
By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?
Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I'd like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.
Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?
You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.
Hello.
That sounds awful. Raj?
Oh, I see. How about now?
No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.
Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.
Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I'll get your room ready.
Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.
How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.
Yeah, you know what's not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we're rooting for you.
Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything's going to change. Howard won't be able to come over as much.
And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
Professor Hawking.
Thank you so much. I can't believe you're…
Oh, you're singing. Well, I'm sorry.
Hello.
So, is that a yes?
Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I'm gonna count all those nostril hairs.
Can we please change the subject?
Just wait.
Ah, it's basic thermodynamics. I'm sure we can figure that out.
So I drink.
Oh, it's just a meeting. One simple meeting.
Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.
Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you're an expectant mother, you can't drink alcohol. I don't like to. You can't have sushi. I don't like to. You can't go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.
Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.
Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You're strong, beautiful and tall.
Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.
Yes.
You don't have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I'll be cutting.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?
All right, now I'm starting to sense a little tension.
I am not a know-it-all. I'm a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they're wrong.
Oh, Leonard's mad at me, so I'm making him lemon bars.
Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we're not fat enough, or wearing diapers.
Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.
Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy.
Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.
You know, in fact, I'd like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.
Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.
No, no, he's over there.
Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.
Amy, I didn't want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco.
Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I'd steal it.
Maybe you're right.
I didn't put on my come-hither plaid PJ's for nothing.
It doesn't matter what I want. It's your birthday, you decide.
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.
What? Wh, where's the judgment? Wh, where's the fire and brimstone? Where's the part where you tell us we're going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We're already there.
Well, this is highly insulting.
Yeah. And I don't understand why you're taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she's saying you're a weirdo, too.
How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
Do they know it's there? I mean, should I tell somebody?
Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
