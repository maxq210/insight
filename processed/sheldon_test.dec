Not with commentary.
I didn't invent them, they're there.
You? No, you'll only make it worse.
No?
Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.
I'm a rogue knight elf, don't you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”
Why would I join you?
I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.
I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
You did this?
I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
Dancing?
See, people get it.
Good night Leonard.
Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.
I'll know.
Then it's not dancing night.
It's Halo night.
I'm not hitting on her.
Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.
No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.
Then why did you say it.
How'd that work out for you?
As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offence.
Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
I think that's a week from Tuesday at six.
Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard…
It's important.
When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight.
He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.
Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit.
No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.
Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.
It's right here on the bottom.
So I've decided, I'm going to collaborate with you.
Informal protest.
Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?
I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
I didn't say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.
He can't eat cheesecake, he's lactose intolerant.
That's because I didn't bring one.
Well of course you don't get it, I haven't made it yet. You'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as psychic.
Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind.
Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?
Hi Penny.
There doesn't have to be a reason.
Well alright then.
It's not hard. It's simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.
Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
That's a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn't come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
The Conqueror.
They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.
Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.
You're welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?
Oh yes, it's quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.
Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
Oh, there's my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren't you, you little subatomic Dickens?
But I'm not.
Dr Gablehauser.
Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.
I don't know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.
No, I'm not giving up, I never give up.
Let's see, today's Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo's. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.
Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?
You have two strikes. Three strikes and you're out. It's a sports metaphor.
Your clothes?
Apologize.
In what sense is that a compromise?
This would have worked out a lot better if you'd just told me you were going the office.
I don't make the rules, Leonard.
All right, But I'm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.
Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I'll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
I have a bone to pick with you, sir.
I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
Have faith, gentlemen. We don't need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?
You're right. Monte's gone. We'll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I'll speak. Leonard, you'll play your cello.
The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
Oh good! You're just in time. I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends.
Ask me why.
All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.
That's your badge of honour, your warrior's wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.
Can I make you a cup of tea?
Did you notice the sign on his counter? He's not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
That's the wrong box. Put it back.
Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.
Just to be clear here, you're asking for my assistance.
And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
You're thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn't one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.
To the comic book store. You're probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I've fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?
A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?
Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?
What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?
Do you know, I'm such a good mood, I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.
Oh, I shall.  No!
May I say one last thing.
Why does Leonard get to go?
I can't comment without violating our agreement that I don't criticize your work.
Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
I'm not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can't go.
Penny.
I hadn't thought of that. I guess we're done here.
Did Leonard know about this? Leonard's my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn't know.
That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
I can't take your money.
I've always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour's chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
All right, you have a wager.
Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You're welcome
This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
I'm sorry.
Doing what?  All right, you've made your point.
From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.
Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
But I must have it.
Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
Three-headed lion.
I can't.
Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.
Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
Your turn, Leonard.
It's also your roll.
Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, 'cause I'm drunk as hell and you're still here! Stop yelling! You're making Sheldon cry! I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.
I don't follow.
Penny.  Penny.  Penny..
Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.
Oh. Well, that's understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.
Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.
Why can't Leonard teach you?
Why are you crying?
No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you're feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.
That's a semantically null sentence.
And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.
Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
Well, I suppose. Come in. I'll sleep in Leonard's room. Good night.
Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso's Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It's now under chicken.
So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?
Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.
I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.
All right, then. Good night.
Listen to her, Jim.
Sheldon's journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I've seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo.  Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.
Oh! No, she's right, I don't need to know what you were doing. Carry on.
All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan'l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?
The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
I came to tell you I've got the answer.
Yep.
He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.
No, what's sad is that you don't know Adam West was TV's Batman.
I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
Stop it!
I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
Says the former member of the Corn Queen's Court.
Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
So, I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.
What do I search?
Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.
Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.
Excuse me. I don't know who you're chanting for as I am currently the ball.
You did this, didn't you?
No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.
I can still eat.
Thank you, Penny.
Hold.
A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.
FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
Oh, no, I wouldn't care for that. Amy?
What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die.
Essentially, yes.
Well, if it's not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
It's part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!
Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst!  On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.
What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?
You have to help, it's in the roommate agreement.
Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
All right, I'm ready for my next question.
I should've warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.
May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.
Hello.
It's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.
Proxima Centauri's the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that's wrong!  EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee.  Oh, dear. They really do be crazy.
Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.
April 12th, 2005, Bob's Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.
And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya's preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.
Captain Kirk won.
Wait, now, we don't know that yet. He isn't finished. I have a girlfriend and you don't who?
Knock-knock.
We might not get seats?
Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
All right. What were the symptoms?
I reject it.
The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I'll need time to make things right.
Why not? Penny did it.
But they're not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?
I'm Kermit. You're Scooter.
You know, Leonard, that's actually a valid idea. Very good.
Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.
Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
But I made it better.
Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.
How?
Boy, I'm getting good at this.
Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o'clock and order the same exact thing, and it's now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?
Why not? It seems like you're improvising your entire curriculum.
Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.
Wonder what she's exasperated about. Hello?
Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won't be joining us so let's get started. Um, I thought we'd begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we're here. Okay. I'm Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you're not familiar with that publication, there's a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?
Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.
Forgive me, but I think you'll find my story is more interesting.
Fine. Give me a second.
The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I'm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning's ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.
What didn't they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.
Excellent! It's in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who's with me?
Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It's odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
Mm, it's hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents' marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.
Move. Move. Move!
This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.
Thank you. Is someone smoking?
Good morning, Amy.
It's three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
Unless he takes Bernadette's last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.
Rotating.
There's someone at my door.
Gentlemen, if I may interject, I've decided my rank will be captain. If it's good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it's good enough for me.
Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?
Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.
When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.
Don't you like Amy?
Yes, I did. And now they're cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.
Better than James Bond, because he's tinier.
All aboard! Woo-woo! It's official. I'm an H-O trainiac.
Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.
Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother's fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.
Told you.
Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.  Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.
well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don't you keep staples in your top desk drawer?
Science. You wouldn't understand.
Well, if it's of any help, I've read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.
She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn't sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I'm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn't that right, LD?  No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He's gone.
Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that's cool.
And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?
Feel free to retain a lawyer.
I don't need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.
As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it's slow outside. I love my mind.
Well, then, I guess it's plausible. Hang on a second, mister.
Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you're willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.
What are you proposing?
Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a . Okay. No, no. I'll start over. Professor
There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
This is not your office. It hasn't been assigned yet.
I found him. He's in the bathroom. President Siebert?
Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains.
Help! Somebody help!
Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen. But I see your point.
Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group's resident cut-up.
Interrupting physicist.
They're mint in box.
But I said I'm sorry.
That's close enough.
Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.
I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.
No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy's dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?
I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can't be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.
Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu' taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.
Good. Now, I assume we're splitting the cheque?
Oh, very well. I can't keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.
My point is I don't like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we're on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I'm not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.
But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.
No, that's my potty training journal.
There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.
No.
Yes! This party just became a major rager.
What's a hickey?
My problem is I'm out of tea.
You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren't using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn't it?
He's in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.
A naked man sat on it. Now, here's my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?
Uh, I'm going to draw you a soothing bath. Where's your bath thermometer?
Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?
Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.
No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.
I understand.
No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.
Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.
Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You're a slave.
Yeah, well, we're not. We're an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we're idiots. And to tell you the truth, I'm starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.
Wait. They might be hostile.
Nobel. Kripke. Don't look at my board.
See, I did all this great work, and now he's just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.
See?
I'll do what I can. But it's not going to be easy, because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic
You pick that up right now.
One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That's Leonard's.
You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
Well, the evidence does support that.
Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
More than anything.
I know. I'm still learning to control it.
She's remarkable.
If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.
All right, I'll tell you. My goodness, everyone's on their game today.
Well…
The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.
So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.
Well, they can't cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.
And now what?
Fine, I'll do it.
You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
No!
Well, perhaps you're obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?
Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It's in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.
How about a hearty handshake?
Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he's been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.
Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.
I'd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
I wish I could believe you.
Penny, it's your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.
Don't try and trick me into buying something I don't want. Now let's talk Aquaman.
That's odd.
She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.
Amy?
Fine. Leonard, there's no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.
Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I'd like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.
Well, why wouldn't I be?
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won't be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we'll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.
Howard, if you're going to lie to your wife, don't start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That's a dead giveaway.
You know, frankly, I'd prefer a sex tape.
Is it me, or does she not look so good?
You distract me. I've been distracted since the moment I met you.
I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.
Oh, it won't hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying. I'm annoying. I'm annoying. I'm annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can't stand it when I'm right.
So, uh, what do you say?
Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?
I don't know why that surprises you. I'm a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?
Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.
Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.
That's what makes their friendship unlikely,
Can you believe this guy?
No, no, no, that's okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn't that right, Bawwy.
What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?
<i>She went into labor an hour ago.
No, it's not. I've seen things. Lady things.
Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I'm the janitor of my sister's birth canal.
I don't get it.
Well, don't ask me. Until I see the prequel, I'm lost.
Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?
Should I follow you?
Would you like to talk about it?
Please.
Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don't need them. I'm starting my own convention.
People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.
Vintage? Be specific.
Do another one, do another one.
It doesn't?
Which I also figured out by myself.
Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.
I don't need to explain myself to you!
Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.
Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…
I take it back. I'm scared of turbulence!
You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
Well, they do.
Hawkman. It's your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn't pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.
I'm fine.
Wow. A Death Star cake.
Why do I need you now?
You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I'd be happy to explain it to you in words you'll understand.
It doesn't matter.
Wrong. Hunt's. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?
Yeah, I feel renewed. I'm ready to deal with any changes that come my way.
Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do.
Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don't think you'd understand a single thing I was talking about.
Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.
It's been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.
I'm not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?
Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?
Ow. We didn't vote!
Oh, it's used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.
Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
Good. Little claustrophobic.
He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?
Well, now, don't get defensive. You're oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.
I'm still upset about that peanut sauce.
All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
Were you hoping we would because it's prom?
Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can't have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.
Very well.
It's not the same thing. I don't think you know how I feel at all.
I can't believe this. You're happy, I'm happy. Well, maybe a holiday that's all about giving isn't so… Get your hand out of that box.
All the time.
Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
I've been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.
Very well. And good luck, I'm a pretty laid-back guy.
I'm sorry, I was aiming for your heart.
Well, as you may know, I've been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?
There you go, perfect.
Oh, really? What if I don't? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?
Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
Who wrote that?
Hmm. No, not yet.
Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.
No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.
Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I'm sorry you had to see that.
Ah, that's just as well. As much as I'd love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I'd most like to have dinner with is myself.
Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.
I'll begin. Uh, I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you're all by yourself.
Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
Well, Leonard, don't you want to see the inside of the fort?
Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in.
Excellent.
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the ear of the bat, it's the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.
I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I'm having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I'm in charge. Now, why don't you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?
And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
You know what they all do, right?
Wrong. Obesity.
Whoa.
But I wasn't. ‘Cause I didn't have any friends.
What happened?
Okay. If you say so.
It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.
Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.
Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.
Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?
Why not?
You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.
Unhand me. This is ridiculous.
It is extraordinary.
We do?
Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I'm restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.
I smell funny. I taste salty.
Leonard, I've got terrible news.
Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I've won the battle but lost the war?
I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I'm not. You're moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.
All right.
Hey, let's not pull at that thread. Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other. Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem I'm having with my current friends. Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.
Let's see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?
I feel like I know what song that is, but I can't put my finger on it.  My country, 'tis of thee. No.
Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.
No, I can't. I need to make preparations for Amy's birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don't have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.
No, no, no. It's your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.
I'm glad to see you made it safely. How's your hotel?
I miss you as well.
You know how, when you're sick, you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people's feelings don't matter?
No, no, no, wait. I'm not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee's I'm Sorry played on the pan flute.
And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.
That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?
Good. Then I'll be leaving now.
Oh, that's very kind of you. But I'm sure you'll all have a better time without me. Let's go, Stuart.
Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?
It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.
Yeah.
Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.
When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…
I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.
But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?
How could you do that?
Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn't realize you'd spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?
I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.
Well, how would I know?
No, he didn't do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren't you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.
All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can't handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.
Gladly.
She did.
They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You're thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.
Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.
I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I've been Sheldon the Genius. Although I've never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don't understand. Which is ironic 'cause, you know, genius.
You don't have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I'll be cutting.
All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.
Why would you do that?
This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn't get you all worked up, I'd kiss you right now.
Who are you calling? Aaargh!
You know, if you'd like, I could call your landlord and complain.
But that's my room.
Good choice, it's disgusting.
Dividing our belongings is difficult.
I have gotten much better at that.
Do they know it's there? I mean, should I tell somebody?
I get to write a contract? I say, let's get this party of the first part started.
